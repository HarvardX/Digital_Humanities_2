forest scenery book iii section i we concluded the last book with a catalogue for it was little more of the principal forests which formerly overspread the island of britain none of them at this day possesses it is original grandeur a few have preserved some little appearance of scenery but the greater part are wastes newforest in hampshire is among the few which have retained any ideas of their ancient consequence  at least it is superior to the rest on account of the extent of it is boundaries the variety of it is contents and the grandeur of it is scenes  with these scenes i propose in the following book to illustrate the observations which have been made in the two preceding books and shall in several excursions through the different parts of this woody country endeavor to point out it is peculiar beauties but tho i shall chiefly consider it in a picturesque light i shall vary my subject by giving a general idea of the ancient history and present state of this celebrated forest  this tract of woodland was originally made a forest by william i in the year  0   about thirteen years after the battle of hastings and is indeed the only forest in england whose origin can be traced it took the denomination of newforest from it is being an addition to the many forests which the crown already possessed and which had formerly been appropriated in feudal times the original name of this tract of country was ytene  as several forests were more commodiously situated for royal diversion than newforest the historian has been sometimes led to conceive that william must have had other ends than amusement in making this addition to them and observing farther it is vicinity to the coast of normandy he has from this circumstance drawn a surmise that under the idea of a forest william meant to preserve an unobserved communication with the continent which would enable him to embark his troops on either side without giving alarm  but this surmise depends on no historical evidence neither indeed is it probable the coasts of kent and sussex were more commodious for the embarkation of troops than any part of newforest and it is absurd to suppose an army could be embarked any where without observation southampton indeed was commodious enough but this port neither lies in newforest nor does the forest in any degree skreen it is avenues  besides the affairs of william were never in so perplexed a situation as to require privacy especially at the time when he made this forest which was after he had defeated all his enemies and was of course in the height of his power  nor indeed was it agreeable to the general character of this prince to do things secretly he rather chose on all occasions to sway the scepter with a lofty hand  the judicious rapin seems to close the whole debate very justly by observing that this surmise seems to have arisen merely from an opinion that so politic a prince as william could do nothing without a political end whereas the most politic princes no doubt are swayed where their pleasures are concerned by passions and caprice like other men vol i fol page       the means which william used in afforesting these extensive woodlands create another question among historians the general opinion is that he destroyed a number of villages and churches drove out the inhabitants laid their lands waste and formed newforest in their room  this opinion has appeared to some ill sounded and voltaire in particular has stood up in defense of the humanity or rather the policy of william it is absurd he thinks to suppose that a prince so noted for prudent and interested conduct should lay waste so much cultivated ground plant it with forest trees which would be many years in coming to perfection and for the sake of a few deer turn adrift so large a body of his industrious subjects who might have contributed so much to the increase of his revenues see his abridgment of universal history   voltaires conclusion may be just but his reasoning is certainly illfounded it proceeds on the improbability of so wide a desolation whereas it might have proceeded better on the impossibility of it for how could william have spread such depopulation in a country which from the nature of it must have been from the first very thinly inhabited the ancient ytene was undoubtedly a woody tract long before the times of william voltaires idea therefore of planting a forest is absurd and is founded on a total ignorance of the country he took his ideas merely from a french forest which is artificially planted and laid out in vistas and alleys it is probable that william rather opened his chases by cutting down wood than that he had occasion to plant more  besides tho the internal strata of the soil of newforest are admirably adapted to produce timber yet the surface of it is in general poor and could never have admitted even if the times had allowed any high degree of cultivation  upon the whole therefore it does not seem possible that william could have spread so wide a depopulation through this country as he is represented to have done  on the other hand there is no contending against the stream of history and tho we may allow that william could not make any great depopulation we are not to suppose he made none at all many writers who lived about his time unite in lamentable complaints of his devastations according to them at least thirty miles of cultivated lands were laid waste above fifty parish churches and many villages destroyed and all the inhabitants extirpated in sylva quae vocatur nova foresta ecclesias et villas eradicari gentem extirpari et a feris fecit inhabitari hen de huntingdon  nova regia foresta anglice ytene quam gulielmus bastardus hominibus fugatis desertis

knighton    but it is to be considered that these writers were monks who had taken high offense at william for his exactions on their monasteries and were neither as it appears informed themselves nor disposed through their prejudices to inform others many things they say are palpably false  in this dearth therefore of historical evidence we are still at a loss to suppose that william made no devastation and to suppose that he made all which these prejudiced monks lay to his charge seem to be suppositions equally unsupported on the whole therefore the truth of this matter as of most others lies probably between the two opinions  with regard to the situation and boundaries of this extensive forest it occupies the southwest extremity of hampshire and in it is earlier form was a kind of peninsula bounded by the bay of southampton on the east  by the river avon on the west  and on the south by the channel of the isle of wight as far as the needles and to the west of those rocks by the ocean thus the boundaries of newforest were determined by the natural lines of the country  it does not however appear that william i extended the bounds of newforest thus far they are supposed rather to have been enlarged by succeeding princes particularly by henry i who was probably tempted by the natural limits of the country by this prince or at least by some of the early successors of william the whole peninsula was taken in and the bounds of the forest were fairly extended as i have described them to the bay of southampton the river avon and the sea  in those days it was a matter of little ceremony either to make or to enlarge a forest thus says the law it is allowed to our sovereign lord the king in respect of his continual care and labor for the preservation of the whole realm among other privileges this prerogative to have his places of recreation and pastime wheresoever he will appoint for as it is at the liberty and pleasure of his grace to reserve the wild beasts and the game to himself for his only delight and pleasure so he may also at his will and pleasure make a forest for them to abide in see manwood on forestlaw chap ii   agreeable to this spirit of despotism the royal forests were regulated each had it is laws and government and as these differed from each other in very few particulars all were equally grievous to the subject forestlaw indeed was one of the greatest encroachments that ever was made upon the natural rights of mankind and considering the disparity of the object one of the greatest insults of tyranny  the romans had no idea of appropriating game under their government the forests of england like those of america were common huntinggrounds the northern barbarians first pretended to the right of making private property of what being naturally wild belonged equally to all  the idea of forestlaw and forestrights obtained early indeed in saxon times but the saxon princes were in general a mild race and there were some traces of liberal sentiment in their institutions under them untenanted wastes only were afforested  the penalties of forestlaws were gentle  and the execution of them never rigid so that in those equitable times forestlaw was hardly esteemed a burden upon the people  the norman princes were a different race they were fierce haughty violent and despotic under them the language of english law in general assumed a new tone and of forestlaw in particular for as the norman princes were all mighty hunters this part of jurisprudence engaged their peculiar attention it was conceived in the highest spirit of despotism and executed with the utmost rigor of vindictive tyranny if the reader wish to see the mischiefs of forestlaw heightened by poetic images the following lines of mr pope set them in a strong light  thus all the land appeared in ages past a dreary desert and a gloomy wast to savage beasts and savage laws a prey and kings more furious and severe than they who claimed the skies dispeopled air and floods the lonely lords of empty wilds and woods cities laid waste they stormed the dens and caves for wiser brutes were backward to be slaves what could be free when lawless beasts obeyed and even the elements a tyrant swayed in vain kind seasons swelled the teeming grain soft showers distilled and suns grew warm in vain the swain with tears his frustrate labors yields and famished dies amidst his ripening fields what wonder then a beast or subject slain were equal crimes in a despotic reign both doomed alike for sportive tyrants bled but while the subject starved the beast was fed proud nimrod first the bloody chase began a mighty hunter and his prey was man our haughty norman boasts that barbarous name and makes his trembling slaves the royal game the fields are ravished from industrious swains from men their cities and from gods their fanes the levelled towns with weeds lie covered over the hollow winds through naked temples roar round broken columns clasping ivy twined over heaps of ruin stalked the stately hind the fox obscene to gaping tombs retires and savage howlings fill the sacred quires awed by his nobles by his commons cursed the oppressor ruled tyrannic where he durst stretched over the poor and church his iron rod and served alike his vassals and his god whom even the saxon spared and bloodydane the wanton victims of his sport remain but see the man whose spacious regions gave a waste for beasts denied himself a grave stretched on the land his second hope survey at once the chaser and at once the prey lo rufus tugging at the deadly dart bleeds in the forest like a wounded heart windsor forest   it is true indeed the principal object of forestlaw was the preservation of game which the offender killed at his own peril but when we recollect how extensive the royal forests were including little less than an eighth part of the kingdom  when we consider the mischievous nature of every species of game and particularly of forestdeer in cultivated lands  when we observe farther that many of the royal forests were blended with private property  that the limits of others were very undefined  and lastly when we reflect how easy a matter it was by a stretch of royal authority to fix the locality of a trespass in a forest tho it was never committed there we may easily conclude from the whole how fertile a source of vexation forestlaw might be made tho it merely respected game  but other grievances accrued many encroachments were made on private property extravagant claims were pretended by forestofficers and heavy tolls were levied on such merchandise as passed through the kings forests tho in fact it could pass in no other direction see king johns charter of forests  sometimes also needy princes and most of them were needy with a view to raise money would send commissioners purposely to examine into foresttrespasses and on these occasions we may be sure there was always exaggeration enough  this accumulation of hardship was at all times deeply felt and resented and whenever the reins of government slackened in the hands of a weak prince the spirit of the nation arose and endeavored to resume its native rights success at last attended these repeated struggles forestlaw was abolished at least its mischievous effects were repressed  but if the people imagined this victory would reinstate them in their native rights over the forest they were mistaken a new species of law under the denomination of gamelaw arose upon the ruins of forestlaw this law had from it is institution an aristocratic cast for the barons and great men who had wrested the rigor of forestlaw from the prince did not mean to free the people from the imposition but only to administer it themselves and thus a thousand tyrants started up instead of one some of the severer penalties indeed were abolished a man preserved his eyes or his hands tho he killed a pheasant or a partridge but he was fined  he was imprisoned  his dog was shot  his arms were taken from him  and he was continually teased with vexatious suits besides as gamelaw was more extensive than forestlaw it involved greater numbers within it is influence  at the time when forestlaw was abolished all the encroachments which the crown had made on the confines of forests were given back then it was that newforest was reduced within it is ancient bounds and all those lands which bordered on the bay of southampton the river avon and the sea were restored to their old possessors these lands were then distinguished by the name of the purlieus of the forest and their owners at least some of them by way of indemnification for injuries received enjoyed several privileges particularly the right of commoning in the forest and of killing trespassing deer provided they were killed before they entered the forest which was always esteemed their sanctuary see manwood on forestlaw   the shape of newforest is a kind of irregular triangle wide at the south and drawing to a point toward the north contained within a circumference of about fifty miles it is limits on every side are very accurately known and described but in a work of this kind it will answer no end either of amusement or of utility to walk it is bounds  so far indeed am i from intending to be accurate in this matter that i propose in the following descriptive view of newforest to take very great liberties with it is boundaries and to consider the forest in it is ancient and most extended state limited by the bay of southampton on the east by the river avon on the west and by the sea on the south without taking this liberty i should lose the description of some of the most beautiful scenery that formerly belonged to it  but before i enter on the picturesque part of my work it remains as i have already given a short account of the ancient state of newforest to add a short account also of it is present state it is government demeisns and inhabitants  sect ii the government of newforest is at this time nearly what it originally was excepting only that the abolition of forestlaw has restrained the power of it is officers i had many particulars with regard to the present state of newforest from mr samber of castlemalwood lodge who was intimately acquainted with it after his death his son capt samber of the navy obligingly put into my hands other useful papers on the same subject which had belonged to his father   the chief officer belonging to it is the lordwarden who is generally some person of great distinction the present lordwarden is the duke of gloucester  under him are two distinct appointments of officers the one to preserve the venison of the forest and the other to preserve it is vert the former term in the language of forestlaw includes all species of game the latter respects the woods and lawns which harbor and feed them  of those officers who superintend the game are first the two rangers but the office of ranger as well as that of bowbearer and a few others have been long in disuse at least they seem to be delegated to the keepers of these there are fifteen who preside over as many walks into which the forest is divided in each walk is erected a lodge a few of these lodges are elegant mansions and are the habitations of the keepers who are generally men of fashion or fortune prince william of gloucester has one the duke of bolton another and lord delawar a third but in general the lodges are but moderate buildings and are inhabited by the underkeepers or groomkeepers as they are called on whom the executive part of the keepers office devolves  the underkeeper feeds the deer in winter  browzes them in summer  knows where to find a fat buck  executes the kings warrants for venison  presents offenses in the forestcourts  and prevents the destruction of game in this last article his virtue is chiefly shown and to this purpose the memory of every sound keeper should be furnished with this cabalistic verse stablestand dogdraw backbear and bloodyhand see manwood on forestlaw chapter xviii    it implies the several circumstances in which offenders may be taken with the manner as it is phrased if a man be found armed and stationed in some suspicious part of the forest  or if he be found with a dog pursuing a stricken deer  or if he be found carrying a dead deer on his back  or lastly if he be found bloody in the forest he is in all these cases seizable tho the fact of killing a deer cannot be proved upon him the underkeeper also drives the forest that is he annually impounds all the cattle that pasture in his walk and sees them examined and properly marked  with regard to the woods of the forest which were originally considered only as they respected game the first officer under the lordwarden is the woodward it is his business as his title denotes to inspect the woods he prevents waste  he sees that young trees are properly fenced  and he assigns timber for the payment of forestofficers this timber is sold by auction at the court at lyndhurst and annually amounts to about seven hundred pounds which is the sum required  under the woodward are twelve regarders and to these indeed chiefly is delegated the executive part of his office the regarders seize the hedgebills and axes of trespassers present offenses in the forestcourts and assign such timber as is claimed by the inhabitants and borderers of the forest for fuel and repairs of this inferior wood there are great quantities assigned on every side of the forest i can only speak of my own assignment as vicar of boldre which is annually twelve load  besides these officers who are in effect the officers of the crown as they are appointed by the lordwarden there are four others called verderors who are commonly gentlemen of property and interest in the neighborhood and are elected like the knights of the shire by the freeholders of the county these officers since the justiciaryineyre has been a sinecure are the only judges of the forestcourts the verderor is an ancient forestofficer his name occurs in the earliest account of forestlaw but tho his appointment has at present a democratical cast it is probable that he was formerly a royal officer and that his election by the freeholders of the county was extorted from the crown in some period favorable to liberty as newforest was always considered as the great magazine of navy timber the verderors were empowered by an act of parliament in king williams time to fine delinquents to the amount of five pounds in their attachmentcourts whereas in all the other forests of england the fine does not amount to more than a few pence which was the original amersement the verderor is an officer without salary but by ancient custom he was entitled to course and take what deer he pleased in his way to the forestcourt but this privilege is now compounded by an annual fee of a buck and a do  besides these ancient officers of the forest there is one of later institution since timber became valuable as a material he is called the purveyor and is appointed by the commissioner of the dock at portsmouth his business is to assign timber for the use of the navy the origin of the purveyor is not earlier than the reign of charles ii in whose time five hundred oaks and fifty beeches were annually assigned for the kings yards and this officer was appointed to assign them but it being found that the forest could ill supply so large a quantity of oak instead of five hundred the number was afterward reduced to sixty which together with fifty beeches are still annually assigned mr sambers ms  the purveyor has a salary of fifty pounds a year and six and eightpence a day when on duty  i shall conclude this account of the officers of the forest with the singular character of one of them who lived in the times of james and charles i it is preserved in hutchins history of dorsetshire see vol ii p      the name of this memorable sportsman for in that character alone he was conspicuous was henry hastings he was second son to the earl of huntingdon and inherited a good estate in dorsetshire from his mother he was one of the keepers of newforest and resided in his lodge there during a part of every huntingseason but his principal residence was at woodlands in dorsetshire where he had a capital mansion one of his nearest neighbors was the lord chancellor cooper first earl of shaftsbury two men could not be more opposite in their dispositions and pursuits they had little communication therefore and their occasional meetings were rendered more disagreeable to both from their opposite sentiments in politics lord shaftsbury who was the younger man was the survivor and the following account of mr hastings which i have somewhat abridged is said to have been the production of his pen  mr hastings was low of stature but very strong and very active of a ruddy complexion with flaxen hair his clothes were always of green cloth his house was of the old fashion in the midst of a large park well stocked with deer rabbits and fish ponds he had a long narrow bowlinggreen in it and used to play with round sandbowls here too he had a banquettingroom built like a stand in a large tree he kept all sorts of hounds that ran buck fox hare otter and badger and had hawks of all kinds both long and short winged his great hall was commonly strewed with marrowbones and full of hawkperches hounds spaniels and terriers the upper end of it was hung with foxskins of this and the last years killing here and there a polecat was intermixed and hunters poles in great abundance the parlour was a large room completely furnished in the same style on a broad hearth paved with brick lay some of the choicest terriers hounds and spaniels one or two of the great chairs had litters of cats in them which were not to be disturbed of these three or four always attended him at dinner and a little white wand lay by his trencher to defend it if they were too troublesome in the windows which were very large lay his arrows crossbows and other accoutrements the corners of the room were filled with his best hunting and hawking poles his oistertable stood at the lower end of the room which was in constant use twice a day all the year round for he never failed to eat oisters both at dinner and supper with which the neighboring town of pool supplied him at the upper end of the room stood a small table with a double desk one side of which held a churchbible the other the book of martyrs on different tables in the room lay hawkshoods bells old hats with their crowns thrust in full of pheasant eggs tables dice cards and store of tobaccopipes at one end of this room was a door which opened into a closet where stood bottles of strong beer and wine which never came out but in single glasses which was the rule of the house for he never exceeded himself nor permitted others to exceed answering to this closet was a door into an old chapel which had been long disused for devotion but in the pulpit as the safest place was always to be found a cold chine of beef a venisonpasty a gammon of bacon or a great applepye with thick crust wellbaked his table cost him not much tho it was good to eat at his sports supplied all but beef and mutton except on fridays when he had the best of fish he never wanted a london pudding and he always sang it in with my part lies thereina he drank a glass or two of wine at meals put syrup of gillyflowers into his sack and had always a tunglass of smallbeer standing by him which he often stirred about with rosemary he lived to be an hundred and never lost his eyesight nor used spectacles he got on horseback without help and rode to the death of the stag till he was past fourscore  sect iii having given an account of the government and officers of newforest in the last section i shall now examine the state of it is demeisns in the year      a survey of newforest was taken by order of the commissioners of the landrevenue of the crown in which survey the following account was given in of it is contents  acres forestlands       lands held with lodges      encroachments  00 leaseholds under the crown  00  freeholds and other intermediate property       total within the perambulation       a few fractions which make about two or three acres more i have omitted from this survey a splendid map of newforest has been engraved by order of the commissioners by william faden geographer to the king in which the curious may see the boundaries and contents of newforest with all the lands granted by the crown the leaseholds and encroachments very accurately ascertained    and inhabitants  the soil of newforest which is in general a sandy loam is well adapted to the production of oaktimber this tract of woody country therefore has long been considered as one of the great magazines for the navy it was formerly thought to be inexhaustible but by degrees it was observed that it began to fail so early as in queen elizabeths reign manwood tells us that the slender and negligent execution of the forestlaw has been the decay and destruction in almost all places within this realm of great wood and timber the want whereof as well in this present time as in time to come shall appear in the navy of this realm see manwood on forestlaw chap ii     in queen elizabeths reign manwoods remark was speculation but in the reign of charles ii it took the air of prediction the decay of timber which had long been gradually coming on began then to be felt it is sources failed as the demand increased in most commodities the demands of a market immediately produce a supply but timber requires ages to make it marketable it may be added that the navy magazines had not then those resources which they have since found timber was with difficulty brought from the inland parts of the country on account of the badness of the roads  little foreign timber was imported  and what rendered the evil more conspicuous in charless time the nation was on the eve of a naval war such pressing necessity urged strongly the propriety of making provision for a future supply charles who had a sort of turn for shipbuilding and had on that account a kind of affection for the navy was easily induced to issue an order under his sign manual to sir john norton woodward of newforest to enclose three hundred acres of waste as a nursery for young oak mr sambers ms  the expense of which was to be defrayed by the sale of decayed wood this order bears date december   th       but tho the enclosure here specified was trifling in itself yet it had the merit of a new project and led to farther improvements a few years afterward the same idea was taken up on a more enlarged scale in the  0th of king william an act passed impowering certain commissioners to enclose two thousand acres in newforest for the growth of timber and two hundred more every year for the space of twenty years afterward  this provident act was as well executed as it had been projected a very considerable part of the quantity prescribed at least four thousand acres were enclosed and planted in burleywalk above six hundred acres were enclosed  in rhinefieldwalk the same number  in boldrewoodwalk above four hundred  in egworthwalk one thousand  in bramblehillwalk above seven hundred  in dinneywalk above five hundred  in castlemalwoodwalk a quantity not ascertained mr sambers ms  and the timber of these enclosures is now secure from all danger and is thrown out again into the forest none of it has yet been felled as it is not yet in a state of perfection but it is in a very flourishing condition and is at this day the glory of the forest  in the reigns of queen ann and george i i believe no new plantations were made which is the more to be wondered at as the severe hurricane in the november of the year   0  did great injury in newforest not fewer than four thousand of it is best oaks were destroyed see evelins sylva  together with great quantities of growing timber  in the reign of george ii three enclosures were made but they were injudiciously or dishonestly managed and mr coleman who undertook the business was fined in the forestcourt at lyndhurst by the verderors for his neglect mr sambers ms  some attempts have been made in the present reign but for want of being properly planned or honestly managed very little advantage has accrued in the year      an inquiry was instituted by an order from the treasury into the quantities of navytimber in newforest  that is such timber as would measure thirtyfive cubic feet the quantity given in after a very nice survey was fiftytwo thousand load  forty cubic feet make a load  at the same time the timber in deanforest was surveyed which tho of much smaller dimensions than newforest contained sixtytwo thousand load   the great defect indeed here as in other national matters is the want of honesty public affairs become private jobs large enclosures have been made merely to enrich the undertakers by the profits of enclosing or the plunder of the underwood it is said that although the flourishing plantations made by king william are at this time receiving injury from growing too close they are rather suffered to continue as they are than to run the hazard of being dishonestly thinned for it has sometimes been found that in thinning trees the best instead of the worst have been removed nor can any thing prevent such mischief but the care and honesty of forestofficers and the persons they employ  what a general rapacity reigns in forests may be conceived from the devastation which even inferior officers have been able to commit not many years ago two men of the name of batten father and son succeeded each other in the office of underkeeper in one of the forestwalks the underkeeper is supposed to cut holm and other underwood of little value to browze his deer and when the rind and spray are eaten off he faggots the dry sticks for his own use but these fellows cut down the young timber of the forest without distinction and without measure which they made up into faggots and sold and for this paltry gain i have been informed they committed waste in the forest estimated at fifty thousand pounds damage the calculation seems large but we may well imagine that in the unremitted course of sixty or seventy years great mischief might be done for tho a young sapling may not intrinsically be worth more than half a crown yet the great difficulty of getting another thriving plant to occupy it is room in the forest raises it is consequence to the public much beyond it is mere specific value  but the decay of forests is not owing solely either to the legal consumer or the rapacious trespasser the oak of the forest will sometimes naturally fail mr evelin remarks see his sylva  that every forest in which oak and beech grow promiscuously will in a course of ages become entirely beechen if this be a just remark the oak we are to suppose has not so strong a vegetative power as the beech which in time prevails over the whole  whatever truth there may be in the observation certain it is that this appearance of decay is found in many of the woodlands of newforest which consist chiefly of beech and unthriving oak  besides these sources of mischief the woods of the forest are subject to another that of fire in sultry weather it is furzy heaths are very combustible and the neighboring cottagers are supposed sometimes to set them purposely on fire to make pasturage more plentiful the danger arises from the difficulty of stopping these fires which will sometimes continue burning more or less at the mercy of the wind during several days in the early part of the summer      which was remarkably dry many of these fires were lighted particularly one near fritham which did great damage the following was an advertisement from the lords of the treasury on this occasion  whereas on friday night the   th of april last some person or persons did maliciously and audaciously set fire to one of the enclosures near fritham in newforest whereby a very large number of young oak and beech trees growing therein and part of the fence thereof were destroyed notice is hereby given that any person who will give information of the person or persons who set fire to the aforesaid enclosure except the person or persons who committed the same so as he or they may be brought to justice shall on conviction of the offender or offenders receive the reward of forty pounds  whereas also the heaths and furze in several other parts of the said forest have been lately set on fire whereby large tracts thereof and many young trees growing thereon have been destroyed notice is hereby given that a reward of five pounds will be paid to any person or persons upon whose information the person or persons who set fire to the same shall be convicted  the rewards aforesaid to be paid on conviction of the offenders by mr tombs deputysurveyor of the forest  lyndharst june  d        from these and other causes many parts of this extensive forest are now in a state of extreme decay being overspread merely with holmes underwood and stunted trees which in the memory of man were full of excellent oak mr sambers ms   in planting oak it has been a doubt whether it is more judicious to sow the acorn after enclosing and grubbing the ground  or to sow it without either operation in the wild parts of the forest in the midst of thornbushes and hollies which will defend the sapling from cattle till it be able to stand alone and will draw it in it is early state to much quicker maturity than it can arrive at without such shelter the latter way of sowing acorns in the wild parts of the forest is not so sure but much larger quantities may be sown at a much less expense and if one tenth part of the acorns succeed the saving is great on an equal quantity of timber i cannot however help doubting the efficacy of this mode of raising timber tho i have often heard sensible people who have lived in the neighborhood of the forest speak favorably of it and it is certain that timber is often raised fortuitously in this manner we see in the wild parts of the forest trees which have attained the growth of ten twenty or thirty years as far as we can judge without any aid and we are at a loss to know how nature manages a work of this kind and rears this exposed part of her offspring amidst deer and cattle and yet we see the same kind providence in a higher part of the creation we see the children of the cottage exposed to mischief on every side and continually running risks which delicate mothers would tremble at yet befriended by a gracious protector they get forward in life and attain maturity like the wildings of the forest in a manner which they who speculate only on human means cannot easily conceive  in planting the forest some again have been advocates for uniting the two modes i have specified the ground is enclosed but not grubbed and the acorns sown at random the late duke of bedford when he was lord warden was very intent on raising timber in this fortuitous manner he merely enclosed and left it to chance to fill his enclosures but i do not find that any of them have succeeded  if the ground were enclosed and a spot here and there grubbed in which two or three acorns were sown and some little care taken afterward of the infantwood it might be of all others perhaps the most certain and the least expensive way of raising timber  but the woods of the forest have not alone been the objects of devastation it is lands also have suffered after the forest had lost it is great legal support and reasons of state obliged the monarch to seek his amusements nearer home the extent of these royal demeisns began insensibly to diminish newforest among others was greatly curtailed large portions of it were given away in grants by the crown many gentlemen have houses in it is interior parts and their tenants are in possession of well cultivated farms for tho the soil of newforest is in general poor yet there are some parts of it which very happily admit culture thus the forest has suffered in many places what it is ancient laws considered as the greatest of all mischiefs under the name of an assart see manwood chapter ix sec    a word which signifies grubbing up it is coverts and copses and turning the harbors of deer into arable land a stop however is now put to all grants from the crown the crown lands became public property under the care of the treasury when the civil list was settled the king can only grant leases for thirty years and the parliament seldom interferes in a longer extension except on particular occasions  besides these defalcations arising from the bounty of the crown the forest is continually preyed on by the encroachments of inferior people there are multitudes of trespassers on every side of it who build their little huts and enclose their little gardens and patches of ground without leave or ceremony of any kind the underkeepers who have constant orders to destroy all these enclosures now and then assert the rights of the forest by throwing down a fence but it requires a legal process to throw down a house of which possession has been taken the trespasser therefore here as on other wastes is careful to rear his cottage and get into it as quickly as possible i have known all the materials of one of these habitations brought together  the house built  covered in  the goods removed  a fire kindled  and the family in possession during the course of a moonlight night sometimes indeed where the trespass is inconsiderable the possessor has been allowed to pay a fine for his land in the court of lyndhurst but these trespasses are generally in the outskirts of the forest or in the neighborhood of some little hamlet they are never suffered in the interior parts where no lands are alienated from the crown except in regular grants  the many advantages which the borderers on forests enjoy such as rearing cattle and hogs obtaining fuel at an easy rate and procuring little patches of land for the trouble of enclosing it would add much one should imagine to the comfort of their lives but in fact it is otherwise these advantages procure them not half the enjoyments of common daylabourers in general they are an indolent race poor and wretched in the extreme instead of having the regular returns of a weeks labor to subsist on too many of them depend on the precarious supply of forest pilfer their ostensible business is commonly to cut furze and carry it to the neighboring brickkilns for which purpose they keep a team of two or three foresthorses while their collateral support is deerstealing poaching or purloining timber in this last occupation they are said to have been so expert that in a nights time they would have cut down carried off and lodged safely in the hands of some receiver one of the largest oaks of the forest but the depredations which have been made in timber along all the skirts of the forest have rendered this species of theft at present but an unprofitable employment in poaching and deerstealing they often find their best account in all the arts of which many of them are well pactised from their ealiest youth they learn to set the trap and the gin for hares and pheasants to ensnare deer by hanging hooks baited with apples from the boughs of trees and as they became bolder proficients to watch the herd with firearms and single out a fat buck as he passes the place of their concealment  in wild rugged countries the mountane forms a very different character from the forester he leads a life of labor he procures nothing without it he has neither time for idleness and dishonest arts nor meets with any thing to allure him into them but the forester who has the temptation of plunder on every side finds it easier to trespass than to work hence the one becomes often a rough manly ingenuous peasant the other a supple crafty pilfering knave even the very practice of following a nightoccupation leads to mischief the nightly wanderer unless his mind be engaged in some necessary business will find many temptations to take the advantage of the incautious security of those who are asleep  from these considerations mr st john draws an argument for the sale of forestlands poverty says he will be changed into affluence  the cottager will become a farmer  the wilderness will be converted into rich pastures and fertile fields furnishing provisions for the country and employment for the poor the borders and confines of forests will cease to be nurseries for countygoals the trespasser will no longer prey upon the vert nor the vagabond and outlaw on the venison nay the very soil itself will not then be gradually lost and stolen by purprestures and assarts thus forests which were formerly the haunts of robbers and the scenes of violence and rapine may be converted into the receptacles of honest industry see observations on the landrevenue of the crown p       i had once some occasional intercourse with a forestborderer who had formerly been a noted deerstealer he had often like the deerstealer in the play  struck a do and born her cleanly by the keepers nose indeed he had been at the head of his profession and during a reign of five years assured me he had killed on an average not fewer than an hundred bucks a year at length he was obliged to abscond but composing his affairs he abjured his trade and would speak of his former arts without reserve he has oftener than once confessed the sins of his youth to me from which an idea may be formed of the mystery of deerstealing in it is highest mode of perfection in his excursions in the forest he carried with him a gun which screwed into three parts and which he could easily conceal in the lining of his coat thus armed he would drink with the underkeepers without suspicion and when he knew them engaged would securely take his stand in some distant part and mark his buck when he had killed him he would draw him aside into the bushes and spend the remaining part of the day in a neighboring tree that he might be sure no spies were in the way at night he secreted his plunder he had boarded off a part of his cottage forming a rough door into it like the rest of the partition struck full of false nailheads with such artifice that the keepers on an information have searched his house again and again and have gone off satisfied of his innocence tho his secret larder perhaps at that very time contained a brace of bucks he had always he said a quick market for his venison for the country is as ready to purchase it as these fellows are to procure it it is a forestadage of ancient date non est inquirendum unde venit venison  the encroachments of trespassers and the houses and fences thus raised on the borders of the forest tho at this time in a degree connived at were heretofore considered as great nuisances by the old forestlaw and were very severely punished under the name of purprestures see manwood chapter x sec   as tending ad terrorem ferarum  ad nocumentum forestae  and as might be added at this time by the neighboring parishes ad incrementum pauperum when a stranger therefore rears one of these sudden fabrics the parishofficers make him provide a certificate from his own parish or they remove him but the mischief commonly arises from a parishioners raising his cottage and afterward selling it to a stranger which may give him parishrights these encroachments however are evils of so long standing that at this day they hardly admit a remedy many of these little tenements have been so long occupied and have passed through so many hands that the occupiers are now in secure possession  where the manor of beaulieuabbey is railed from the forest a large settlement of this kind runs in scattered cottages at least a mile along the rails this nest of incroachers the late duke of bedford when lordwarden of the forest resolved to root out but he met with such sturdy and determined opposition from the foresters of the hamlet who amounted to more than two hundred men that he was obliged to desist mr sambers ms  whether he took improper measures as he was a man of violent temper  or whether no measures which he could have taken would have been effectual in repressing so inveterate an evil  and yet in some circumstances these little tenements encroachments as they are and often the nurseries of idleness give pleasure to a benevolent breast when we see them as we sometimes do the habitations of innocence and industry and the means of providing for a large family with ease and comfort we are pleased at the idea of so much utility and happiness arising from a petty trespass on a waste which cannot in itself be considered as an injury  i once found in a tenement of this kind an ancient widow whose little story pleased me  her solitary dwelling stood sweetly in a dell on the edge of the forest her husband had himself reared it and led her to it as the habitation of her life he had made a garden in the front planted an orchard at one end and a few trees at the other which in forty years had now shielded the cottage and almost concealed it in her early youth she had been left a widow with two sons and a daughter whose slender education only what she herself could give them was almost her whole employment and the time of their youth she said was the pleasantest time of her life as they grew up and the cares of the world subsided a settled piety took possession of her mind her age was oppressed with infirmity sickness and various afflictions in her family in these distresses her bible was her great comfort i visited her frequently in her last illness and found her very intelligent in scripture and well versed in all the gospeltopics of consolation for many years she every day read a portion of her bible seldom any other book just knew and knew no more her bible true and in that charter read with sparkling eyes her title to a treasure in the skies when she met with passages she did not understand at one time or other she said she often heard them explained at church  the story seems to evince how very sufficient plain scripture is unassisted with other helps except such as are publicly provided to administer both the knowledge and the comforts of religion even to the lowest classes of people  the dialect of hampshire has a particular tendency to the corruption of pronouns by confounding their cases this corruption prevails through the country but it seems to increase as we approach the sea about the neighborhood of newforest this doric has attained it is perfection i have oftener than once met with the following tender elegiac in churchyards  him shall never come again to we but as shall surely one day go to he having thus given a short account of the present state of newforest and it is inhabitants i hasten to the more agreeable part of my work the description of it is scenery i have already apprized the reader see p     that i propose to consider it is boundaries in their widest extent as advancing to the bay of southampton on the east to the river avon on the west and to the sea on the south  within equal limits perhaps few parts of england afford a greater variety of beautiful landscape it is woody scenes it is extended lawns and vast sweeps of wild country unlimited by artificial boundaries together with it is riverviews and distant coasts are all in a great degree magnificent it must still however be remembered that it is chief characteristic and what it rests on for distinction is not sublimity but sylvan beauty  but before i enter on a particular description of the scenery of newforest in a picturesque light it may not be improper to give the reader a kind of table of contents of what he is to expect  isle of wight map of the isle of wight  sect iv on looking into a map of newforest and drawing an imaginary line from ringwood on the avon to dibden on the bay of southampton the whole forest easily divides itself into four parts that district which lies north of this imaginary line we may call one part the river avon and lymingtonriver make the boundaries of a second lymingtonriver and beaulieuriver of a third and the country between this last river and the bay of southampton may be considered as a fourth  when i spoke of forests in general as consisting of large tracts of heathyland and carpetlawns interspersed with woods see vol i p   0  i had a particular view to the scenery of newforest which is precisely of this kind it is lawns and woods are every where divided by large districts of heath many of these woods have formerly been as many of the heaths at present are of vast extent running several miles without interruption different parts too both of the open and of the woody country are so high as to command extensive distances tho no part can in any degree assume the title of mountainous  along the banks of the avon from ringwood to the sea the whole surface is flat enclosed and cultivated there is little beauty in this part eastward from christchurch along the coast as far as to the estuary of lymingtonriver we have also a continued flat much heathy ground is interspersed but no woody scenery except in some narrow glen through which a rivulet happens to find it is way to the sea in two or three of these there is some beauty  here the coast which is exposed to the ocean and formed by the violence of storms is edged by a broken cliff from which are presented grand seaviews sometimes embellished with winding shores as we leave the coast and ascend more into the midland parts of this division the scenery improves the ground is more varied woods and lawns are interspersed and many of them are among the most beautiful exhibitions of this kind which the forest presents  in the next division which is contained between the rivers of lymington and beaulieu we have also great variety of beautiful country the coast indeed is flat and unedged with cliff as it lies opposite to the isle of wight which defends it from the violence of the ocean but the views it presents are sometimes interesting it is wooded in many parts almost to the waters edge and the island appearing like a distant range of mountains gives the channel the form of a grand lake  as we leave the sea the ground rises and the woods take more possession of it especially along the banks of the two rivers i have just mentioned which afford on each side for a considerable space many beautiful scenes there are heathy grounds in this district also but they occupy chiefly the middle parts between these two tracts of woodland  in that division of newforest which is confined by beaulieuriver and the bay of southampton the midland parts are heathy as in the last but the banks and vicinity both of the river and the bay are woody and full of beautiful scenery this division is perhaps on the whole the most interesting of the forest for besides it is woods there is greater variety of ground than in any other part here also are grander waterviews than are exhibited any where else the views along the banks of beaulieuriver it has in common with the last division but those over the bay of southampton are wholly it is own  one disagreeable circumstance attends all the seaviews which are opposite to the isle of wight and that is the ouziness of the beach when the sea retires a pebbly or a sandy shore has as good an effect often when the sea ebbs as when it is full  sometimes perhaps a better but an ouzy one has an unpleasant hue however this shore is one of the best of the kind for the ouze here is generally covered with green seaweed which as the tide retires gives it the appearance of level land deserted by the sea and turned into meadow but these lands are meadows only in surface for they have no pastoral accompaniments  the northern division of newforest contains all those parts which lie north of ringwood and dibden as this district is at a distance from the sea and not intersected by any river whch deserves more than the name of a brook it is adorned by no waterviews except near dibden where the forest is bounded by the extremity of the bay of southampton the want of water however is recompensed by grand woody scenes in which this part of the forest equals if not exceeds any other part  in noble distances also it excels for here the ground swells higher than in the more maritime parts and the distances which these heights command consist often of vast extensive forestscenes  besides the heaths lawns and woods of which the forest is composed there is another kind of surface found in many parts which comes under none of these denominations and that is the bog many parts of the forest abound in springs and as these lands have ever been in a state of nature and of course undrained the moisture drains itself into the low grounds where as usual in other rude countries it becomes soft and spongy and generates bogs these in some places are very extensive in the road between brokenhurst and ringwood at a place called longslade bottom one of these bogs extends three miles without interruption and is the common drain of all those parts of the forest in landscape indeed the bog is of little prejudice it has in general the appearance of common verdure but the traveller must be on his guard these tracts of deceitful ground are often dangerous to such as leave the beaten roads and traverse the paths of forest a horsetrack is not always the clue of security it is perhaps only beaten by the little foresthorse which will venture into a bog in quest of better herbage and his lightness secures him in a place where a larger horse under the weight of a rider would flounder if the traveller therefore meet with a horsepath pointing into a swamp even tho he should observe it to emerge on the other side he had better relinquish it the only track he can prudently follow is that of wheels  having thus presented the reader with a general view of newforest i shall now endeavor to give him a more intimate acquaintance with it and shall lead him into some of it is most beautiful scenes  nor was the beauty of the forest a matter of no concern even at a time when we might have supposed the pleasures of the chase engrossed mens whole attention there are three special causes says manwood why the forestlaws have so carefully provided for the preservation of the vert of the forest the first is for the sake of cover for the deer the second for the sake of the acorns mast etc which feed them the third is propter decorem for the comeliness and beauty of the same in a forest for the very sight and beholding of the goodly green and pleasant woods in a forest is no less pleasant and delightful in the eye of a prince than the view of the wild beasts of chase and therefore the grace of a forest is to be decked and trimmed up with store of pleasant green coverts manwood chap vi   one should scarce have expected such a passage as this in a lawbook on such authority however i hope i may consider the scenery of the forest as essential to the very existence of it and shall proceed with more confidence in the description of those goodly green and pleasant woods the sight and beholding whereof is so comely and delightful  in this detail i shall rarely go in quest of views into the intricacies and recesses of the forest these sweet retreats would often furnish a great variety of pleasing scenes but it would be difficult to ascertain and point them out to the observation of others i shall satisfy myself therefore with following the great roads or at least such as are commonly known where views may easily be ascertained reserving only the liberty of stepping a little aside when any thing of peculiar excellence deserves attention  i should in this detail also pursue my rout through the forest with a careful eye to the arbitrary division i have made of it into four parts see page     but as the roads will not always admit such exactness i must be content to follow the rout prescribed by the surveyors of the highways keeping within the division i have prescribed as nearly as i can  sect v remarks on the western parts of newforest from vicarshill to ringwood and from thence through christchurch to lymington from vicarshill we passed boldrebridge and ascending the opposite bank called ropehill to battramsly we had a beautiful view of the estuary of lymington river which when filled with the tide forms a grand sweep to the sea it is seen to most advantage from the top of the hill a few yards out of the road on the right the valley through which the river flows is broad it is screens are not lofty but well varied and woody the curves of the river are marked by long projections of low land and on one or two of them some little saltern or other building is erected which breaks the lines the distance is formed by the sea and the isle of wight all together the view is picturesque it is what the painter properly calls a whole there is a foreground a middleground and distance  all harmoniously united  we have the same view only varied by position from many high grounds in the neighborhood but i know not that it appears to such advantage any where as from this hill  at battramsly we join the londonroad  from hence to brokenhurst the forest exhibits little more than a wild heath skirted here and there with distant wood  brokenhurst is a pleasant forestvillage lying in a bottom adorned with lawns groves and rivulets and surrounded on the higher grounds by vast woods  from the churchyard an expanded view opens over the whole on the left rise the woods of hinchelsea and adjoining to these the woods of rhinville the center is occupied by the high grounds of boldrewood the little speck just seen among them is a summer house built by lord delawar to command a forestview the house among the woods on the right is cuffnels the seat of mr rose and still more to the right are the woods of lyndhurst  at the entrance of brokenhurst a little to the right mr morants house commands a very grand and picturesque forestview both the foreground and the distance are complete  the former is an elevated parkscene consisting of great variety of ground wellplanted and descending gently into the plain below among the trees which adorn it are a few of the oldest and most venerable oaks of the forest i doubt not but they chronicle on their furrowed trunks ages before the conquest  from this grand foreground is presented an extensive forestview it consists of a wide range of flat pasturage one of the spreading lawns of the forest see page   0  garnished with tufted clumps and woody promontories shooting into it and contrasted by immense woods which occupy all the rising grounds above it and circle the horizon the contrast between the open and woody parts of the distance and the grandeur of each part are in the highest style of picturesque beauty  this grand view is displayed to most advantage from the front of the house but it is seen also very advantageously through other openings among the trees of the foreground  as you leave the village of brokenhurst the woods receive you in a noble rising vista in which form the road is cut through the forest this vista is exceedingly grand a winding road through a wood has undoubtedly more beauty than a vista and in a smaller scene we always wish to find it and even reprobate the vista wherever it occurs but through a vast forest the vista is in better taste tho i do not in the least apprehend we are under obligations on this score to the surveyor of the highways he took the direct road which happened on this occasion to be the line of beauty on other occasions under the same principle he has missed it but here it suits the greatness of the scene and shows the depth of the forest and the vastness of the woods to more advantage regular forms are certainly unpicturesque but from their simplicity they are often allied to greatness so essential is simplicity to greatness that we often see instances in which the stillness of symmetry has added to grandeur if not produced it while on the other hand we as often see a sublime effect injured by the meretricious charms of picturesque forms and arrangements  we are not however to conceive of the forestvista as we do of the tame vistas formed by the hand of art as it is cut through a tract of woody country there is first of course no formality in the disposition of the trees in the artificial vista the trees are all of one age and planted in regular growth the whole plan is the offspring of formality and the more formal it is the nearer it approaches that idea of perfection at which it aims but in the forestvista the trees are casually large or small growing in clumps or standing single crouding upon the foreground or receding from it as the wild hand of nature has scattered them and it is curious to see with what richness of invention if i may so speak nature mixes and intermixes her trees and shapes them into such a wonderful variety of groups and beautiful forms art may admire and attempt to plant and form combinations and clumps like hers but whoever examines the wild combinations of a forest which is a delightful study to a picturesque eye and compares them with the attempts of art has little taste if he do not acknowledge with astonishment the superiority of natures workmanship  the artificial vista again is rarely composed of more than one species it is the fir the lime or the elm but in the forestvista you have not only different kinds of trees intermixed but bushes also and underwood and wild plants of all kinds which are continually producing new varieties in every part  open groves too make another variety in the forestvista in the woods between brokenhurst and lyndhurst an open grove is continued on the right with little interruption between the seventh and eighth stones the woods on the left are chiefly close  besides these grand vistas are not only varied with such smaller openings and recesses as are formed by the irregular growth of trees they are broken also by lawns and tracts of pasturage which often shoot athwart them one of this kind and a very beautiful one occurs at the sixth stone and another tho of inferior size and beauty at the seventh  added to this intermixture of lawn and wood the rising and falling of the ground in various parts of this vista produce another species of variety the elevation is no where considerable but it is sufficient to occasion breaks in the convergency of the great perspective lines it creates also new beauties in the scenery particularly in some parts on the left where you look down from the road among trees retiring and sinking from the eye till the stems of the most distant are lost in the deep shadows of the descending recesses  all these circumstances tho the last is more general give the forestvista a very different air from the artificial one diversifying the parts of which it is composed so much that the eye is never fatigued with surveying them while the whole together presents one vast sublime object like a grand gallery of exquisite pictures it fills the eye with all it is greatness while the objects on each side continually changing afford at every step a new entertainment  a late traveller through russia does not see these beauties in a forestvista the country says he through which we passed was illcalculated to alleviate our sufferings by transferring our attention from ourselves to the objects around us the road ran as strait as an arrow through a perpetual forest through the dreary extent of a hundred and ten miles the gloomy uniformity was only broken by a few solitary villages i beg the readers pardon for not quoting my author i certainly met with the passage but not noting the reference at the time and not opening my ms for sometime afterward it has now escaped me   no doubt the continuation of a hundred and ten miles in any one mode of scenery may be rather fatiguing but i should have thought that few modes of scenery were better calculated to transfer the attention from a disagreeable subject i know not indeed what the nature of a vista through a russian forest may be but if it partake of the circumstances that i have just been describing in this vista through newforest it must consist of varieties which could not easily be exhausted  the account i have here given of the forestvista is the sober result of frequent examination a transcript of the first feelings would have been rhapsody which no description should indulge the describer imagines that his own feelings of a natural scene can be conveyed by warm expressions whereas nothing but the scene itself can convey his feelings loose ideas not truth but verisimilitude is all that verbal description pretends to convey and this is not to be done by high coloring but to be aimed at by plain appropriate intelligible terms  i should add before i leave this pleasing vista that to see it in perfection a strong sunshine is necessary even a meridian sun which has a better effect on the woods of the forest than on any other species of landscape see v i page      is not perhaps too strong for such a scene as this it will rarely happen but that one side or the other of the vista will be in shadow and this circumstance alone will produce contrasts which will be highly agreeable  i may add also that this vista appears to much greater advantage as we rise through it to lyndhurst than as we descend to brokenhurst  as we passed this vista we saw in many parts through the trees on the left the pales of newpark just removed from the road this park which is the only one in the whole district of newforest is about four miles in circumference it was first used to secure stray cattle forfeited to the lordwarden but in the year    0 it was strongly fenced by charles ii for the reception of a particular breed of reddeer which he procured from france the expense of this work stands thus in the treasurybooks  fencing newpark and holm coppice l  00 winter provision for reddeer  0 pens to feed them  0 paddocks to catch them and turn them out  0 l   0  it is now converted into a farm having been granted in the last reign to the duke of bedford for the term of thirty years  in all the grand scenery of the forest which we have just examined we see little appearance of fine timber most of the best trees have been felled the landscape however is not much injured on a foreground indeed when we have a single tree we wish it to be of the noblest kind and it must be confessed that in our passage through this vista which in every part as we pass along becomes a foreground there is a great deficiency of noble trees many of the oaks are scathed and ragged and tho in composition trees of this kind have frequently their effect see v i page    yet in a rich forestscene if they present themselves too often offend for all the other purposes of scenery inferior trees if they be full grown answer tolerably well and when intermixed with stunted trees and brushwood as they are in all the wild parts of the forest they are more beautiful than if the whole scene was composed of trees of the stateliest order interstices are better filled and a more uniform whole is produced  considered in this light a forest is a picture of the world we find trees of all ages kinds and degrees  the old and the young  the rich and the poor  the stately and the depressed  the healthy and the infirm the order of nature is thus preserved in the world and the beauty of nature is thus preserved in the forest  a gentleman once consulted his friend who pretended to a degree of taste about the propriety of cutting down some trees which shaded a winding avenue to his backfront where his offices were placed his friend advised him by all means to leave them untouched they are beautiful said he in themselves and you see they skreen that part of your house which you would wish to have skreened the gentleman seemed convinced and the next time he met his friend i have taken your advice said he and have left the trees standing and so indeed he had but all the stunted wood and undergrowth which he considered as offensive rubbish he had rooted up overlooking their use in composition the consequence was he laid all the offensive part of his house open let in the light and entirely destroyed the scene  in the first book i mentioned the different effects of soil and climate on trees see v i page     in newforest these observations are well illustrated the oaks there seem to have a character peculiar to themselves they are the most picturesque trees of the kind we meet with they seldom rise into lofty stems as oaks usually do in richer soils but their branches which are more adapted to what the shipbuilders call knees and elbows see ibid  are commonly twisted into the most picturesque forms in general i believe the poorer the soil the more picturesque the tree  that is it forms a more beautiful ramification  besides the newforest oak is not so much loaded with foliage as the trees of richer soils an overloaded foliage destroys all form on the other hand when the leaf is too thinly scattered the tree looks blighted shrivelled and meagre the point of picturesque perfection is when the tree has foliage enough to form a mass and yet not so much as to hide the branches one of the great ornaments of a tree is it is ramification which ought to appear here and there under the foliage even when it is in full leaf it is the want of this species of ramification which gives a heaviness to the beech see v i page      the great avenue from brokenhurst leads through the space of five or six miles after we have mounted the summit of the hill the close views in the descent on the other side are very beautiful consisting of little woody recesses open groves or open glades varied as they were before in different forms  as we approach lyndhurst we pass foxlees on the left the situation here is just the reverse of mr morants the one stands high and commands the forest at a distance the other in a bottom is surrounded by it both modes of situation have their beauty but an extensive forestview before the house with a few noble trees on the foreground is not only at all times a better picture but it is also more agreeably varied by the occasional incidents of light and weather of which the other is not capable  in a part of the skreen which divides these grounds from the road we have an opportunity of remarking the disagreeable effect of trees planted alternately the eye is disgusted with looking first on a fir secondly on an elm thirdly on a fir fourthly on an elm again and so on and yet this tiresome monotony under the name of variety is one of the commonest modes of planting in planting we should certainly endeavor at least to plant like nature which gives us the best criterion of beauty this alternacy is a direct and studied opposition to all her pleasing forms of composition it not only shows the hand of art but of the most tastless art how much more beautiful would such a skreen appear made up of different kinds of trees in masses of each or in an indiscriminate mixture of all together  the town of lyndhurst makes a picturesque appearance as we approach it but instead of entering it we left it on the right and turned abruptly into the road to minsted the ground here is much varied it is hilly broken and wooded in clumps with cottages here and there interspersed nothing in the pastoral style can be more picturesque  we have also extensive views through the woods particularly a grand retrospect toward southampton but as we approach minsted the woods fail all becomes cultivation and the idea of a forest is in a great degree lost soon after we enter the western road to ringwood over a spacious heath  at the eightysecond stone about a quarter of a mile down the hill on the right from the road we are shown the scene of the celebrated event of rufuss death when i mentioned the tree see v i page      on which the arrow tyrrel glanced i offered some reasons for supposing it might be admitted as evidence in identifying the place the scene also in some degree bears the same testimony for history informs us the diversion of the day was now over the sun was declining and william dismounting his horse was enjoying a moments rest after the fatigue of the chase see william of malmsb and henry of huntingdon  when a stag darted suddenly across the heath the king turning toward it and lifting his hand to skreen his eyes from the sun see an account which rapin gives in a note from sir john haywood  at that moment received the arrow the scene is a sweet sequestered bottom open to the west where the corner of a heath sinks gently into it but sheltered on the east by a beechen grove and on every other side by clumps of trees forming an irregular skreen around it among which are several winding avenues of greensward  it is the very place where a person heated with toil might be allured to stop for a moments repose but the chief circumstance of evidence is that as the place is open only to the west where the heath was never probably covered with wood the king could there only have been incommoded by an eveningsun  having taken a view of this scene which in itself unconnected with the history it records is a pleasing one we ascended again into the great road and pursued the heath over which it led  it is a wild expanse unadorned with wood but bounded on every side by very extensive distances in front you discover the high grounds of the isle of purbeck on the left you have a large range over the isle of wight in the retrospect you overlook the bay and town of southampton and on the right is spread before you a vast stretch of distant country bounded by the hills of wiltshire and dorsetshire this last is the only part of these distances which has any picturesque value about the eightysixth stone the parts of it are best disposed but it is the richest about the eightyninth where it is seen over a woody bottom which makes a middle ground  in this part of the forest the paling of one of the new enclosures to secure timber which ran a considerable way in a strait line deformed our views sometimes indeed the paling of parks and forests is picturesque where it runs winding round a hill and appears again perhaps in some opposite direction but in general it is an unpleasing object and what in adorned scenery we should wish to hide indeed all divisions of property are great nuisances to the picturesque eye which loves to range at large and it adds peculiar beauty to the forest that in general the grand lines of nature and various swelling of the ground are unbroken by these intrusions and have their full play and undulation in remote distances hedgerows pales and other objects offensive on the spot become one rich blended surface  and yet even on the spot winding lanes with fullgrown hedges on each side are often beautiful it is clipping and making as they phrase it which ruin the picturesque idea utility is always counteracting beauty no sooner is the hedge in perfection than it is destroyed if the reader wish to know an ancient mode of making hedges he will find it as follows in the fifth book of q curtius having planted twigs very close in the situation they wished they bent their branches as they made shoots and inserted their extremities into the earth here they took root and from these roots shot into new branches these again were bent into the earth and so on till a fence was obtained of the dimensions wanted  i have seen this mode i believe practiced in some parts of england   the approach to ringwood as we leave the wild heath which gave occasion to this digression is woody and pleasant  ringwood was formerly the boundary of the forest in this part and in times of still more remote antiquity was a place of great note i know not whether in saxon times it did not claim the honors of regal residence at present it is a cheerful village seated in a flat country on the banks of the avon which spreads near the town into a large piece of water full of little islands and frequented by swans  somewhere near this part of the river the duke of monmouth is said to have been taken on the eighth of july      after his defeat at sedgmore near bridgwater thus far he had traveled in disguise and generally by night feeding on pulse and green corn which he found growing in the fields but i think the account more probable that he was taken near woodlands in dorsetshire see hutchings hist of dorset p  0 and      it was thought however that he intended to have secured himself in the woods of newforest with which he was well acquainted from having frequently hunted in them i have heard a tradition that his body after his execution was sent down into the forest and buried privately in boldrechurchyard but i cannot find any ground for the surmise the register of the year is yet extant in which no notice is taken of any such burial unless he were buried as might possibly have been the case under a fictitious name  from ringwood to christchurch the country is flat and the lanes close and woody scarce any distant view is admitted except here and there among the meadows on the right on the left mr comptons park at bistern affords some variety running a considerable way along the road and grazed with herds of large speckled cattle without horns  as we leave the village of sopley the meadows on the right form a better landscape than we had yet had the parts are large tho flat and the whole is bounded with wood in which the tower of christchurch appears as a principal object the church to which it belongs was formerly monastic it is a grand pile partly saxon and partly gothic some of it is gothic members are beautiful particularly a small chapel near the altar dedicated to the virgin mary which for proportion and beauty of workmanship is a very elegant piece of gothic architecture the church is now parochial  the town of christchurch which takes it is name from the church is a place of great antiquity here we find the ruins of a castle which was intended formerly to secure the mouth of the avon this river is joined by the stour below the town where uniting in a full stream they wind together through a bleak coast forming it first into large flat meadows and then opening into a bay before they enter the sea the view which is not very interesting is bounded by a ridge of high lands called christchurch head on the right and on the left by the western end of the isle of wight which in this part makes a remarkable appearance it is seen nearly in front and it is broken cliffs when the noontide sun in winter shines strongly upon it appear like the ends of two fractured walls with a dark cavity between them  from christchurch to lymington the country continues flat cultivated and enclosed scarce an object presents itself a little to the right of the road you see a large house built by lord bute for the benefit of the seaair it stands on a cliff directly opposite to cherburgh from which it is about sixty miles distant and it overlooks the sea just in that point where christchurch head and the western promontory of the isle of wight form an immense colonade before it  the road to the house runs directly to the front narrow and contracted at the entrance but opening by degrees the house first appears then the extent of the lawn which is ample with a pavilion at each extremity these from the sea appear to connect it with the house and give it consequence beyond the lawn the grand colonade just mentioned extends and beyond all the expanse of the ocean there is something very amusing in thus contemplating an idea which is continually dilating and opening itself from a narrow tunnel into infinite space if it were the effect of chance or necessity we have only to admire the happiness of it  the cliff on which the house stands is about fifty or sixty yards high it is not perpendicular but the ground being of a spongy foundering nature is continually falling in huge masses and affords an easy foundation for winding stairs among the heaps of ruin which occupy the slope at the bottom you are received by a clean sandy beach where at the ebb of the tide you may continue your walk many miles  the house is a sumptuous pile and contains much curiosity but as i am in quest only of scenery my subject forbids me to enter houses lord bute has made an attempt to adorn the cliff around him with a plantation but if it should not thrive i think the loss not great trees in so exposed a situation may perhaps just get hold of the ground but i should think it impossible for them to produce either shelter or ornament indeed in views of this kind i have my doubts whether the rural idea should not purposely be excluded as interfering with the native grandeur of the scene flowers and flowering shrubs at least seem to be alien beauties  as we leave lord butes the country still continues flat cultivated and enclosed scarce a single opening presents itself we observed however one species of landscape which in so flat a surface is singular  those hollows or dells mentioned in the general view of the forest see page     running across it to the sea they have not indeed the consequence of mountaindells yet some of them afford pleasing scenery the most remarable are those of chuton ashley and effort in each of these there is a little rivulet which the traveller ignorant of the country will sometimes be surprised to see swollen to an extraordinary size without any apparent cause the case is they communicate with the sea at a very little distance but being totally screened from it and sheltered by wood on every side they have the appearance of inland brooks tho in fact they are under the influence of a tide  the cliff on which lord butes house stands runs two or three miles along the coast toward lymington and is known by the name of hordwell cliff the summit of it is a fine carpet down and is much frequented in the summerseason by company from lymington for the sake of seaair and seaviews the sides of this cliff as was observed frequently fall in and after one of these founders as they are called the masses of ruin form a bold rough bank against the sea which secures the coast from another founder till that body of earth is washed away and the landsprings have loosened the earth above when the cliff again falls in within these last twenty years the sea has gained near a quarter of a mile in some places on this coast and the calculators of the country say that lord butes house cannot possibly stand above thirty years he has taken however great pains to secure it by diverting at a great expense the landsprings so that he has little to fear but the action of the sea which tho a rough enemy is a much less dangerous one and against this he has endeavored to guard by facing the precipice in different parts with stone  in this cliff between christchurch and lymington is found a great variety of fossil shells about a hundred and twenty different sorts were collected by mr gustavus brander of christchurch and presented to the british museum mr brander published also in      descriptions and very neat engravings of them under the title of fossilia hantoniensia these shells are found about fourteen or fifteen feet below the surface the stratum above them is sand and gravel the soil in which they are found is a bluish clay and runs down from the gravelly stratum to a level with the sea and probably much deeper in every part of this cliff these shells are found but chiefly about the village of hordwell it is difficult to get them the collector must clamber up the sides of the precipice and then extricate them from the clay which is very stiff by a tool their texture too is so brittle that in cleansing them he runs a great risque of breaking them  what is remarkable few of these shells belong to this coast or indeed to any european coast and many of them as far as is known are found no where else it is remarkable also that this stratum of shells runs in a northerly direction quite through newforest wherever the earth is opened to any depth in digging marle or on other occasions shells are found tho i never saw them of any size except upon the coast  a little below hordwell the cliff fails and the coast becoming flat between this place and lymington is commodiously formed into salterns where great quantities of excellent salt have been made tho the trade has of late fallen off the square bounded receptacles to receive the brine are a glaring injury to the beauty of the shore    about two or three miles farther along the coast stands hurstcastle built at the point of an extraordinary natural causeway which runs two miles into the sea forming a narrow channel between the castle and the isle of wight the causeway itself also is so narrow that it scarce at high water exceeds two hundred yards in breadth in high tides it is much narrower the whole is covered with loose pebbles the side toward the island is a bold shore beaten into ledges or terraces of pebbles by the violence of the waves the other side which is sheltered is undulating marshy and undetermined forming the water when the tide flows into a smooth landlocked bay  from this little peninsula you are entertained with views on each hand the island and the needlerocks are objects dreary vast and grand and not wholly unpicturesque but to make them objects of the pencil they must be well enlightened and the foreground adorned with a little naval furniture  an anchor a net hanging to dry a drifted boat or some other object with which seacoasts abound when i first saw this scene it was in a sultry summernoon and all the cliffs were overspread with that dingy indistinct hue which sometimes accompanies a hot meridian sun the sea which was calm was lighter than the land tho darker than the sky  but in the evening the white cliff at the end of the island together with the needles were tinged with the setting sun and became very splendid and the sea glowing with equal radiance the whole view and every part of it was rich and harmonious  on the other side of the peninsula the hampshire coast extending far and wide forms an immense bay which appears flat woody and interspersed with a variety of distant objects the parts are here and there picturesque but the whole tho amusing is too vast for the pencil  hurstcastle lying level with the beech fully commands the channel which separates the coast of hampshire from the isle of wight it consists of a round tower fortified by semicircular bastions and was among the strongest of those castles which were built by henry viii but since portsmouth has been a place of consequence and always guarded by a fleet this castle as well as others of the same intention are now neglected  in this castle the apartments are still shown where charles i was confined when he was carried from the isle of wight and very miserable they are  on the batteries we saw an instance of hogarths humor when he was painter to the ordinance the carriages have all crowns painted on them with the kings initials below one of them painted exactly in the vulgar style of the rest hogarth has formally put the initials of his name  the form of this castle at a little distance set off by the rocks of the island as a back ground is unpicturesque  the needles which are of the same texture of rock with the neighboring cliffs of the island seem to have been washed from them by the sea a gradual change has been observed even in the memory of man we may easily imagine with what violence a storm at sea pours in among these piles of formidable rocks when the suction and eddies of tides and currents make them dangerous almost in the serenest weather  besides the curious situation of hurstcastle there is another peculiarity on this coast which deserves notice it is an island called the shingles which sometimes rises fifteen or twenty feet above the water and at other times totally disappears it shifts it is situation also rearing itself at one time nearer the isle of wight and at another nearer the coast of hampshire the mystery of it is this in that part of the channel lies a vast bank of pebbles so near the surface that it is beaten up into an island by the raging of the sea sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other as the tides and currents drive from the same causes too all the prominent parts of it are as easily dispersed and the island vanishes when we saw it it consisted of several acres but it was then larger than had been remembered for many years the sea however had found a passage through the middle of it and it was lessening daily  but as the country from christchurch is flat and the sea generally excluded from the fight all these views of the isle of wight the needles and hurstcastle must be obtained by leaving the road and getting a little nearer the coast other interesting views may be sought in the same way both on the right and left of the road at milford and in the neighborhood of it are several good views of these great objects at rookcliff a little nearer the sea the views are again varied the island and coast forming the appearance of an ample bay on the other side of the road about penningtoncommon from mr dixons and other places the distant views make a new appearance just skirting the horizon over a flat country with a long sweep of the island and intervening channel but the most beautiful view on this side is from mr ettys drawing room at priestlands the near grounds sink in the middle into a sort of wide valley which is occupied in the distance by the island and the channel and as they retire from the eye on the left and wind rather toward it on the right the whole has the appearance of a grand lake bounded at this end but running far into distance at the other as the house stands in the center of this view it appears as if the house and view had been adapted to each other which is one of the happiest circumstances that can attend a situation a fine view is pleasing but a fine view adapted to the situation of a house is more so  they who are unacquainted with the country should be apprized that in all these views and wherever the island is seen from the hampshire coast it is insularity is no where discoverable an extensive curtain of it only appears  a little farther to the east stands lymington just at the point where the flat country we had been traveling from christchurch descends to the river which takes it is name from the town the brow and gentle descent of this falling ground the town occupies forming one handsome street which overlooks the high grounds on the opposite side of the river it is a neat well built town and pleasantly seated the houses especially on the side of the street next the coast have views from the windows and gardens of the isle of wight and the sea  across the estuary formed at the mouth of lymingtonriver a dam with floodgates is thrown the intention was to exclude the salt water from the meadows above which it was hoped might have become good pasturage but the purpose is not answered a great beauty however arises from the influx of the tide which forms a handsome piece of water above the dam with many reaches and winding shores we have already observed the beauty of this estuary when seen from the higher grounds as it enters the sea see page     the scenes are equally interesting which it affords when the eye pursues it up the stream into it is recesses in the forest one of the best of them opens from the stableyard of the angelinn in lymington and the parts adjacent  the channel between the isle of wight and the shores of hampshire is sufficiently deep at all times for ships of force and burden which often pass through the needles as it is phrased but if the weather be at all rough it is thought an unsafe passage and in general these narrow seas are frequented by smaller vessels the port of lymington particularly which is entered by a long narrow shallow river is chiefly frequented by light skiffs rigged in the cutterform with a jib and boom these are of all others the most beautiful vessels which frequent a coast to make a large ship a beautiful object some peculiar incident is necessary she must be foreshortened for a ship in profile is formal her sails also must in part be furled for the square sail without any contrast is disgusting a degree of distance also is requisite both to lessen the object and to soften the features of it  but the light skiff with a single mast a jib and boom is beautiful almost in any position as she is often undecked the lines of her sides are generally well contrasted and the various turns and swellings of her sails almost always present some elegant form  of these vessels great numbers frequent the channel between the isle of wight and the coast of hampshire and what adds to the animation of the scene the river forms two or three bold and beautiful curves so that you see each little coastingvessel as she tacks about in entering the harbor or leaving it in every position in which she can possibly present herself a small harbor therefore is much more productive of picturesque objects than one of larger size frequented either by ships of war or of burden a scene like this gave occasion to those very beautiful lines in shakespeare  she sat with me on neptunes yellow sand marking the embarked traders on the flood when we have laughed to see the sails conceive and grow bigbellied with the wanton wind which she with pretty and with swimming gate following her womb then rich with my young squire would imitate and sail upon the land to fetch me trifles and return again as from a voyage rich with merchandise as we leave the dam and pursue our course along the shores of the river we are entertained if it be full with some good lakescenes  on the western side just opposite to vicarshill are the ruins of a romancamp which the country people know by the name of bucklandring tho in fact it is rectangular it gives no value to the scene but if your curiosity lead you to it you will find it a very complete work of the kind there are many larger in england but few more perfect it measures in length about two hundred paces in breadth not quite so much and has been defended by two ramparts and two ditches the whole of these works is entire except the front toward the river which is demolished but in the demolition you may trace the double ditches the ramparts seem to have been about twenty feet high in the front the view is very extensive over the channel and all the environs of the river on the opposite side the eye is carried far and wide into the forest  below the camp runs a creek from the river where it is supposed the romans used to land and works have been thrown up there also with a view no doubt to secure their landing these works resemble those of the camp itself only the area is less and the rampart single  there has been also on the other side of the river exactly opposite to lymington another small fort nothing remains now except the artificial mount on which it had been erected but it is generally supposed to have been a speculatory station to the grand camp of buckland as it commands a wide view of the channel  sect vi remarks on the western parts of newforest in a ride from vicarshill to wilverlylodge  burleylodge  boldrewoodlodge  rhinfieldlodge  setleywood  burnt hill etc  having thus taken a large circuit of near fifty miles round the western parts of the forest i shall now conduct my reader through the same country again interiore gyro the internal parts of this extensive circle are supposed to contain some of the most beautiful scenery of it is kind in the forest but as we had here no turnpikeroad to guide us and a great variety of paths to mislead us we were obliged to put ourselves on horseback under the conduct of one of the underkeepers  instead of holding the great road as before from battramsley to brokenhurst we turned short to the left into the open part of the forest toward a noted landmark called marlpitoak well known to the deerstealer who on this or some neighboring tree often takes his stand in the dusk of a summerevening to watch the herd as it leaves the woods to graze these open grounds  this wild heath receives some beauty from it is swelling in various parts the swells are bold but at the same time easy the ground seldom broken generally falls gently into little valleys  these beauties however are obvious only to the picturesque eye which by a little imaginary finishing can form these rough groundplots into pictures  as we attained the higher part of the heath we had better landscape we had been mounting gradually from the great road through two or three miles when the country giving way on the right a grand display of woodyscenery was opened toward brokenhurst and lyndhurst on the left the heath is but meagerly skirted with wood to make amends however the cliffs of the isle of wight range beyond it in the distance  scattered about these wild grounds we meet with many tumuli between shirleyholms and setleywood are four or five two of them are raised in contiguous circles which is a circumstance rather uncommon it seems to indicate that the persons to whose memory they were constructed had been nearly connected on pacing the circumference of each we find they have belonged to persons of unequal dignity in the proportion of a hundred and eight to eighty three but a little to the east of shirlyholms near peatmerpond arises a larger tumulus than either of these called shirleybarrow it is circumference is one hundred and forty paces  there are many other tumuli on the great heaths of the forest which i mention here as i shall take no farther notice of them  as we descended the gentle heights on which we were now raised a beautiful valley about a quarter of a mile in breadth opened before us arrayed in vivid green and winding two or three miles round a wood on the other side the grounds wild and unadorned fall with an easy sweep into it beyond these a grand woody scene spreads far and wide into distance and as it approaches the eye unites gently with the other parts of the landscape the valley was no other than that vast bog already mentioned known by the name of longsladebottom see an account of it page     it is deceitful surface however does no injury to it is picturesque form only indeed it deprives it of the appendages of grazing cattle the nimble deer trip over it in summer without inconvenience but no animals of heavier bulk dare trust themselves upon it  the name of the wood beyond this verdant valley is hinchelsea  as we leave longsladebottom on the right the grounds which rise on the left are occupied by sethornwood a scene of considerable extent sethornwood was once the noblest of all forestscenes the ground it stood on is beautifully varied and the grandeur and number of it is oaks were the admiration of all who saw them but it is glories are now over during the unremitted course of thirty years it continued to add strength to the fleets of britain itself sufficient to raise a navy in this arduous service it is vigor was at length exhausted and it contains little more at present than shrubs and underwood and blasted trees in the midst of this wood rises a hill called oakbrow from the stately oaks which once adorned it is summit and shaggy sides but it is honors fell a sacrifice not like those of sethorn to it is countrys good but to the convenience of a potent neighbor through the influence of lord delawar whose views it obstructed it is oaks were felled long before any inroads had been made among the woods which incircled them and if the destruction of these oaks had been partial if a few here and there had been left as a foreground the injury on the spot at least might the less be regretted for the views which are thus opened from it is brow make great amends for the loss of it is woods they consist chiefly of two or three beautiful lawns skreened with forestscenery yewtreebottom denotes one of these scenes and evenwaterbottom another the former receives it is name from the species of trees which decorate it the latter from a pool which occupies it is middle area  in forest language valleys in general are called bottoms tho in fact they are wide extended scenes most of them have their little rivulets running through them but these foreststreams are very unlike the streams of a mountainous country pouring among rocks and fretting among pebbles theirs is a tamer nature they are seldom more than little ouzing rills which drain the springy sides of rising grounds and wander slowly unobserved and unobstructed through the valleys of the forest the landscape however seldom wants their paltry assistance the only way in which these rivulets are of any use in a forestscene is when they spread themselves into little pools in some part of the valley as they do here in evenwaterbottom and as they frequently do in other scenes and the merit of these little pieces of water chiefly consists in drawing all the cattle of the neighborhood around their banks which greatly animate and enrich the view  in this part of the forest stands wilverlylodge commanding beautiful views of these sweet wooded lawns and valleys which from the high situation of the lodge are set off with the isle of wight as a background  from wilverly we traversed the pales of a new timber enclosure which is not less than four miles in circumference if the wood which it is meant to defend should ever flourish it would soon create a scene but at present this part of the forest is barren of beauty and there is so very little appearance of the growth of timber that people are apt to suppose it has been ignorantly planted or negligently attended  one reason indeed assigned for the ruin of the young wood is the quantity of rabbits which breed in the dry sandy hills of these parts and which it is difficult amidst such shelter to extirpate a young oak just vegetating from the acorn is esteemed by these pernicious inmates the most delicious food thus it may be said the glory of england may be nipped in the bud by a paltry rabbit  after we leave these dreary pales the country here and there breaks out toward holmsleylodge but nothing is very interesting till we arrive at the brow of burleyhill here the eye is greatly regaled from this height it surveys a grand sweep of different removes of woody distance spreading round a semicircular plain of several miles in extent known by the name of markwaybottom the plain itself consisting of a wellproportioned intermixture of rich heath and green pasturage is something between a forestlawn and a forestheath too large for the one and yet not large enough for the other in two or three different parts it is adorned with those attractive pools which enrich a landscape with the introduction of animal life  the woods which incircle this grand savannah as we survey them from the brow of the hill are those of bury on the left adjoining to these commence the woods of burley and still more to the right those of rhinfield all this rich scenery is in one continued tho varied and broken sweep and ranges at different distances from one mile to ten the woods of bury on the left being he nearest and most elevated entirely fill that part of the horizon under which they spread but beyond those of burley rise in fainter coloring the two woodybosomed hills of lyndhurst and beyond the woods of rhinfield a very remote forestview stretches into all the obscurity of distance every species of country cultivated as well as uncultivated when melted down into distance has a fine effect as we have often observed but the forestdistance is among the richest  such is the grand view from burleyhill continually varying it is appearance as we descend  our road led us over markwaybottom to the duke of boltons at burley which is an excellent forestlodge tho an ordinary ducalseat the late duke having obtained a grant of it for thirty years was at some expense in adorning it he built handsome stables fitted up the house and laid out a lawn before it which is bounded by a piece of embanked water there is but little taste however shown in the improvements nor indeed does the situation deserve much attention it is low and except that it stands in the midst of a beautiful forest it is on the whole illchosen  the lawn of this lodge is adorned with some very grand oaks which from the dignity of their form and venerable appearance as well as the number of the most respectable of them have obtained the name of the twelve apostles  in the woods around this lodge we saw a breed of small cattle which the late duke of bolton procured from scotland while this herd was increasing they were suffered to run wild in the forest but in a course of years when he wished to reclaim a few of them their habits were become so obstinate and their nature so ferocious that it was attempted without success and they are now among the ferae natura of the forest they are mischievous however only when attacked we rode and walked among them without any molestation  from burleylodge it is little more than two miles to boldrewood lodge the seat of lord delawar this house enjoys one of the finest situations of the forest it stands high with an extensive lawn before it from which it commands a vast extent of forestscenery spread around in great variety of distance particularly toward burleylodge where the woods stretch far and wide beyond a lengthened savannah which sets them off to great advantage the same kind of situation only varied is described in page      on the other side of the lawn the distances are woody but more broken and not so remote  nor are the homeviews around this beautiful spot less pleasing than those at a distance we wound near a mile round the lodge through a succession of rich forestscenery composed chiefly of beech the trees thmeselves are among the most beautiful of their kind having been secured from the ax by the protection of the house they adorn but still the beech even in perfection is inferior to the oak the elm and the ash in most of the characteristics of picturesque beauty it has always too much of a spiry pointedness in the extremities of its branches which gives a littleness to its parts in its most beautiful form it rarely shakes off this characteristic imperfection if the trees however as individuals were less pleasing their combinations were highly beautiful and exhibited much scenery from those natural openings and glades which are so often found in the internal parts of forests  all the woods not only around this lodge but in its neighborhood abound in beech the mast of this tree is the most fattening food for deer and gives such repute to the wintervenison of boldrewood walk that a stranger would have difficulty in getting a kings warrant for a do executed in it mr sambers ms   these woods also afford excellent feeding for hogs which are led in the autumnseason into many parts of the forest but especially among the oaks and beeches of boldrewood to fatten on mast it is among the rights of the forestborderers to feed their hogs in the forest during the pawnagemonth as it is called which commences about the end of september and lasts six weeks for this privilege they pay a trifling acknowledgment at the stewards court at lyndhurst the word pawnage was the old term for the money thus collected see manwood on forestlaw p  0    the method of treating hogs at this season of migration and of reducing a large herd of these unmanageable brutes to perfect obedience and good government is curious  the first step the swineherd takes is to investigate some close sheltered part of the forest where there is a convenience of water and plenty of oak or beechmast the former of which he prefers when he can have it in sufficient abundance pliny seems to be of a different opinion glans fagea suem hilarem facit carnem coquibilem ac levem et utilem stomacho tradit nigidius fungosam carnem fieri esculo robore subere lib xvi    he fixes next on some spreading tree round the bole of which he wattles a slight circular fence of the dimensions he wants and covering it roughly with boughs and sods he fills it plentifully with straw or fern  having made this preparation he collects his colony among the farmers with whom he commonly agrees for a shilling a head and will get together perhaps a herd of five or six hundred hogs having driven them to their destined habitation he gives them a plentiful supper of acorns or beechmast which he had already provided sounding his horn during the repast he then turns them into the litter where after a long journey and a hearty meal they sleep deliciously  the next morning he lets them look a little around them  shows them the pool or stream where they may occasionally drink  leaves them to pick up the offals of the last nights meal and as evening draws on gives them another plentiful repast under the neighboring trees which rain acorns upon them for an hour together at the sound of his horn he then sends them again to sleep  the following day he is perhaps at the pains of procuring them another meal with music playing as usual he then leaves them a little more to themselves having an eye however on their eveninghours but as their bellies are full they seldom wander far from home retiring commonly very orderly and early to bed  after this he throws his sty open and leaves them to cater for themselves and from henceforward has little more trouble with them during the whole time of their migration now and then in calm weather when mast falls sparingly he calls them perhaps together by the music of his horn to a gratuitous meal but in general they need little attention returning regularly home at night tho they often wander in the day two or three miles from their sty there are experienced leaders in all herds which have spent this roving life before and can instruct their juniors in the method of it by this management the herd is carried home to their respective owners in such condition that a little dry meat will soon fatten them  i would not however have it supposed that all the swineherds in the forest manage their colonies with this exactness bad governments and bad governors will every where exist but i mention this as an example of sound policy  not as a mere platonic or eutopian scheme but such as has been often realized and has as often been found productive of good order and public utility the hog is commonly supposed to be an obstinate headstrong unmanageable brute and he may perhaps have a degree of positiveness in his temper in general however if he be properly managed he is an orderly docile animal the only difficulty is to make your meanings when they are fair and friendly intelligible to him effect this and you may lead him with a straw  nor is he without his social feelings when he is at liberty to indulge them in these forestmigrations it is commonly observed that of whatever number the herd consists they generally separate in their daily excursions into such little knots and societies as have formerly had habits of intimacy together and in these friendly groups they range the forest returning home at night in different parties some earlier and some later as they have been more or less fortunate in the pursuits of the day  it sounds oddly to affirm the life of a hog to be enviable and yet there is something uncommonly pleasing in the lives of these emigrants  something at least more desirable than is to be found in the life of a hog epicuri de grege they seem themselves also to enjoy their mode of life you see them perfectly happy going about at their ease and conversing with each other in short pithy interrupted sentences which are no doubt expressive of their own enjoyments and of their social feelings  besides the hogs thus led out in the mastseason to fatten there are others the property of forestkeepers which spend the whole year in such societies after the mastseason is over the indigenous foresthog depends chiefly for his livelihood on the roots of fern and he would find this food very nourishing if he could have it in abundance but he is obliged to procure it by so laborious an operation that his meals are rarely accompanied with satiety he continues however by great industry to obtain a tolerable subsistence through the winter except in frosty weather when the ground resists his delving snout then he must perish if he do not in some degree experience his masters care as spring advances fresh grasses and salads of different kinds add a variety to his bill of fare and as summer comes on he finds juicy berries and grateful seeds on which he lives plentifully till autumn returns and brings with it the extreme of abundance  besides these stationary hogs there are others in some of the more desolate parts of the forest which are bred wild and left to themselves without any settled habitation as they cost nothing either in food or care their owners are content with the precarious profit of such as they are able to reclaim  charles i i have heard was at the expense of procuring the wild boar and his mate from the forests of germany which once certainly inhabited the forests of england i have heard too that they propagated greatly in newforest certain it is there is found in it at this day a breed of hogs commonly called forestpigs which are very different from the usual hampshire breed and have about them several of the characteristic marks of the wild boar the foresthog has broad shoulders a high crest and thick briftly mane which he erects on any alarm his hinder parts are light and thin his ears are short and erect and his color either black or darkly brindled he is much fiercer than the common breed and will turn against an ordinary dog all these are marks of the wild boar from whom i have little doubt that in part he derives his pedigree tho his blood may be contaminated with vulgar mixtures see vol i page       but tho he is much more picturesque than the common hog he is in much less repute among farmers the lightness of his hind quarters and the thinness of his flanks appear to great disadvantage in the ham and the flitch  on leaving the beechen groves of boldrewood we were received by a large open swampy heath called no mans walk being under the peculiar jurisdiction of none of the keepers  the woods soon after commenced again in which we passed a large forestvista cut through them from lyndhurst to burleylodge but it wanted the turnpike road which we found in the other vista see page     i could not have supposed how much it lost from the want of this accompaniment without a road there seemed to be no reason for a vista in other respects also it wanted the variety of the lyndhurstvista  along the confines of these woods we skirted a forestlawn called warwicksted which wheeled around us in the form of a crescent near two miles in circuit it was a beautiful scene hung with wood on every side  near this place stands rhinfieldlodge the situation of which is perhaps as pleasing tho not so grand as that of boldrewood it stands on a spreading hill incircled with groves of oak among which indeed greater destruction has been made for the sake of the view than seems to have been necessary as the ground falls on every side from the hill on which the house stands so on every side it soon begins to rise again tho very gently expanding by degrees into a vast circle of forestscenery of every species  extensive woods  skirted heaths  intermixtures of wood and lawn  and all this landscape exhibited through the various removes of distance when we were sated with these grand scenes we had them afterward presented more picturesquely in parts as we descended the hill on which the lodge stands in this descent we caught them every where to great advantage through the boles and branches of the stately oaks which surrounded us as the ground which immediately incircled this hill at the bottom is swampy and watered with rivulets the situation is sometimes in the winter rather uncomfortable when the rains are abundant the waters stagnate so much around the hill that it is almost completely insulated  the next scene we visited was a forestlawn of grand dimensions it seemed not less than nine or ten miles in circumference bounded on every side at least in appearance with woods some of which were on a level with it and others on grounds elevated above it among these latter were the woods of brokenhurst adorned with the spire of the church shooting above them  the peculiarity of this lawn is that it is vast area is a perfect flat  a form which tho less beautiful than a playing surface exceeds it in simplicity and grandeur a small flat is trivial it is a mere bowlinggreen it has neither beauty in it is parts to set it off nor greatness in the whole to make it interesting a small piece of ground therefore should always be varied but an extensive flat like this we are now examining gives one grand uniform idea which fills the imagination the grandest idea of this kind is that of the ocean the greatness of which consists in it is being a continued flat but the ocean presents grandeur without beauty in a view of this kind at land the idea of beauty is more or less impressed by the character of the scenery around it i remember being exceedingly struck with the grandeur of an immense scene of this kind on the borders of scotland called broughmarsh see observations on the lakes of cumberland etc vol ii page  0   it is infinitely larger indeed than this and is environed not with woods which would lose their effect round so vast an area but with mountains romneymarsh in kent is a scene also of the same kind but it is cut in pieces and deformed by parallel lines hedges and canals nor are it is boundaries good instead of woods or mountains it is bounded by the sea and where the sea appears in conjunction with a level surface the effect is bad it joins one flat to another and produces confusion  the extensive forestlawn which gave occasion to these remarks is known by the name of obergreen it is chiefly pasturage patched here and there with heath and is esteemed one of the best feeding grounds both for deer and cattle in the forest  obergreen was the last of those beautiful lawns with which our ride through these parts of the forest was inlivened and i imagine few counties in england could furnish so many pleasing woodlandscenes in so small a compass he who delights in such scenery will find it in much greater perfection in the wildness of a forest than among the most admired improvements of art he will find it grander more varied and every where more replete with those wild enchanting passages which the hand of art cannot give what are the lawns of hagley the late lord lyttletons in worcestershire now lord westcotes  or any other place celebrated for this species of artificial landscape but paltry imitations of the genuine works of nature  hinchelseawood see page  0   which we left on the right in the morning now again skirted our right as we traversed obergreen here it was as great an ornament as it was on the other side at longsladebottom that vast bog which we had seen in the morning winding so beautifully round hinchelseawood now presented it is deceitful furface directly in our way an inexperienced traveller might have ventured to pass it without scruple but our steps were better guided we were carefully led through the skirts of the wood to a place where a mole is thrown across this vast bog with two or three wooden bridges to transmit the moisture  having passed this obstruction we rose blackamsleyhill from whence as in a table of contents we had a view of all the country the woods and the lawns we had passed extending at least nine or ten miles in length  from blackamsleyhill we came to setleywood near which we met again the great road we had left in the morning but instead of continuing in it we crossed it at a gate opposite to a gravelpit as we leave brokenhurst and entered a wild heath called burnthill where some beautiful woody scenes immediately opened  on the left along the declivities hung enclosures of cultivated meadowland and likewise of rough grounds both equally adorned with wood and as these two species of landscape were here contiguous and exactly similar excepting only the article of cultivation they afforded a good opportunity of illustrating the doctrine of gradation one of those great principles in landscape which contributes more than any other toward the production of effect  the force of gradation is most shown in the management of light and colors but it is shown also in the union of objects abruptness it is true and strong oppositions are often great sources of picturesque beauty when properly and sparingly introduced in profusion they are affected but the great principle of gradation has universal influence and enters more or less into every composition  the instance we saw of it here respected the union of objects  on examining a piece of natural ground we see at a single glance how gradually and beautifully nature commonly unites one part with another  the tree with the shrub  the shrub with the brake  that again with the weed  and lastly these lowest decorations with the level ground which is here and there still farther softened into them by patches of more luxuriant herbage see vol i p      but in the cultured field however beautiful in it is kind you see no transition no connection or gradation among contiguous parts even if the hedges introduce no formality of lineal boundary yet the smooth uniform surface whether of grass or of corn joins abruptly with the wood this in a picturesque light is displeasing  but you admire the artificial lawn bounded only with wood you then talk of contrast rather than gradation as a source of beauty  we do and scenes of this kind are often beautiful but one of their great beauties arises still from gradation when we talk of contrast we do not mean simple opposition two contiguous stripes of black and white produce no effect strong oppositions we sometimes allow but they must only appear in transient touches gradation enters into the idea even of contrast it is true in the artificial lawn we commonly require neatness so that the rude connections of nature are excluded but still a lawn bounded with regular wood gives us little pleasure it is the planters care to obtain what gradation he can by bringing some of his clumps forward and thus connecting his lawn with his woods yet with all his art he can never do it in so nobly wild and picturesque a manner as nature in her most beautiful works  the two different kinds of hanging grounds bounded with woods which occasioned these remarks occupied our left in front was an extended skirting of woody scenery which opening itself more and more as we proceeded spread into a noble skreen this scenery consisted of those vast woods which stretch from heathydilton to boldrechurch  these woods hang over the most pleasing meadows about roydon and along all the valley to brokenhurst that ever adorned a landscape it is a landscape indeed of the cultured kind and therefore little accommodated to the pencil but of it is kind it is the most lovely through this valley consisting of hanging meadows variously bounded and adorned with wood the river of lymington while it is yet rural and only a foreststream forms many a devious curve but this pleasing scenery can only be traversed by the footpassenger or the angler with his rod even on horseback you cannot pass the many wooden bridges made of single planks which are thrown athwart the several windings of the stream  leaving these scenes behind us we entered the lanes of roydon broad winding and adorned in one part with an open grove in others with an intermixture of beech and oak which stretching across form a canopy above the head these lanes open upon a heath called sandydown which is supposed to enjoy the best air in it is neighbourhoood here the woods which had before skreened our front now winding round appear with equal magnificence on the left the summit is crowned with boldrechurch which discovering only it is imbattled tower among the trees takes the form of a lofty castle  having crossed the river near the ruins of haywoodhouse once a mansion of considerable note we mounted the hill to the church from whence we had beautiful views on the north to the forest and on the south toward the white cliffs of the isle of wight which are set off by intermediate woods  indeed all the churches of the forest are loftily seated for when the whole country was covered with woods and before roads were cut through them it was necessary to place the church in a lofty situation that the inhabitants might the more easily find their way to it through the devious paths of the forest  sect vii remarks on the middle parts of newforest between the rivers of lymington and beaulieu  directing our course first toward beaulieu we passed the plantations of sir harry burrard at walhampton which extend round his house and are composed chiefly of sir his gardens command extensive views of the isle of wight and the intervening channel but they are views which may rather be called amusing than picturesque they are too extensive for the use of the pencil the distant coast exhibits too long a curtain the hills are too smooth and the waterline is too parrallel with the coast of hampshire the only way to obtain that species of beauty which we call picturesque from so lengthened a view of distant coast is to break it here and there with plantations sometimes immediately on the foreground and sometimes in the second distance and indeed in many parts of the gardens where such portions are intercepted by the woods good pictures are obtained  after all however we must allow that nine persons in ten would be better pleased with these extended views in their present amusing state than if they had been more generally broken in a form to please the picturesque eye few people can distinguish between the ideas of beautiful and picturesque but every eye is pleased with an amusing view  to these sheltered recesses which extend even to my gardengate i am so much indebted through the indulgence of their benevolent owner for the quiet pleasures of many a studious hour that i should gladly enter more minutely into a description of them did not my subject which holds me closely to the wild scenes of nature forbid yet there is one scene which i cannot forbear mentioning it is so nearly allied to nature that it is closely allied also to to my subject the scene i mean is a small lake containing about a dozen acres which has been formed out of a swamp it is wooded on both sides and the view of the whole together is very pleasing when you stand in the open part toward portmerecommon from whence the head which confines the water is concealed and the woods on each side are united at the bottom with those of the garden the walks on both sides are well managed and contain many little pleasing recesses and openings to the water  sir john doyly and mr robbins whose houses we pass in succession have the same views toward the isle of wight and the channel which are presented from the gardens at walhampton but they are seen under different circumstances  sir john doylys capital view is from a circular room at the top of his house which commands a very great extent both of sea and land on the landside the diversified woods of the forest appear stretching far and wide around his house with all the intervening cultivation  houses  cottages  and farms on the other side the sight extends along the channel of the isle of wight in both directions  to the west as far as the open sea and to the east as far as spithead where every motion of the fleet which is stationed there may be observed his lawn has lately been newmodelled and is now only in a state of improvement so that it is effect cannot yet be seen  at pilewell mr robbinss views toward the sea are nearly the same as those from doylypark only seen from a lower stand mr robbinss lawn is a very extensive one it is flat indeed but so much quiet space forms an excellent contrast with the busy scene of navigation which is spread beyond it still however these views are of the amusing kind i should advise the picturesque eye therefore to seek the scenery of the island as he will find it more broken in many parts of the walk which circles the lawn the best view of the whole together is from the dressing room windows  about a mile and a half from baddesly we pass the edge of a piece of fresh water above three miles in circumference known by the name of souleypond in an inlandcountry it would have been thought a considerable lake but it is close neighborhood to the sea diminishes the idea it is not indeed skreened by such noble limits as dignify the lakes of westmorland and cumberland rocks mountains and craggy promontories yet it is marked by an elegant irregular line it is banks arise in gentle swells from the water in some places the skirts of beaulieu woods run down to it is edge and in others low points of level land shoot into it which are always beautiful especially when adorned with groups of figures or of cattle on the whole it is a pleasing scene it produces great plenty of fish and often affords a summerdays amusement to the gentlemen of the neighborhood  from souleypond the road leads toward the banks of beaulieuriver which are rather high in this part and much wooded so that of course the water is skreened from the eye the road however is very beautiful passing through woody lanes and open groves and the woods of beaulieu are the more beautiful as they are almost universally left untouched you scarce see a maimed tree among them  about two miles from souley a strange ruin attracts the eye on the left it appears like the two ends of a barn the roof of which has fallen in but the curiosity of it is it is amazing size from one gavelend to the other it extends eightyone paces the name it is known by is st leonards and it is commonly supposed to have been a barn belonging to the monks of beaulieu who placed here a little establishment of their fraternity to gather the fruits of the country in these parts the vestiges of different buildings and the walls of a small chapel still remain  in a picturesque light this ruin is of no consequence we walked round it and tried it in every mode of perspective if possible to make a drawing from it but the two vast gavelends would enter into no kind of composition  large barns were the common appendages of abbeys and the vestiges of some of them still remain there is a grand building of this kind at battleabbey in sussex tho i should think is is more ornamented than was requisite for a barn there is another very large one at cerne in dorsetshire but the noblest edifice i believe in england under the denomination of a barn is to be seen at choulsey in berkshire about two miles from wallingford this barn is still larger than that we are now surveying it is somewhat above a hundred yards in length and eighteen yards broad it contains four threshingfloors and is supposed to have belonged to the rich abbey of reading tho carrying upon it the date of   0  it is in good condition and still performs the functions of a barn mighty castles and churches in three or four centuries have given way to time but here is a barn which has continued doing it is offices to society through the space of seven hundred years  from the ruins of st leonards the same woody road brought us soon to bucklershard a beautiful semicircular valley or rather a dip of the bank to the edge of the river which forms before it one of it is grandest sweeps  in this pleasing retreat the duke of montague predecessor to the late duke proprietor of all this part of the country proposed to build a town which was to bear his name he was at that time proprietor also of the island of st lucia in the west indies and as he enjoyed all the privileges on the river of the abbey of beaulieu which were great and would have enabled him to invest his colony with many immunities he expected to derive much advantage from a sugar trade as sugars might thus be imported and from the plenty of fuel refined at a much cheaper rate here than they could be any where else and indeed the scheme had the approbation of many men of sounder judgment than the dukes the limits of a town were accordingly planned  the streets were marked out  and the buildinggrounds adjusted but at the peace of      st lucia was declared a neutral island by which the dukes property in it was lost and soon after his only son dying he dropped all farther intention with regard to his new town  bucklershard was however destined to receive a town tho of a different kind the situation was commodious for shipbuilding as well as sugarboiling and was taken for that purpose by mr adams who made large contracts with government for building ships of war several very fine frigates have been built here and some ships of more force the following is a list of the ships of war and their number of guns which have been built at bucklershard  the illustrious of seventyfour guns the vigilant  agamemnon  indefatigable  and europe all of sixtyfour the greenwich and hannibal of fifty the woolwich  romulus  gladiator  and sheerness of fortyfour the thames  thetis  and heroine of thirtytwo the coventry  levant  triton  greyhound  sibyl  and brilliant of twentyeight the surprise  fowey  and mermaid of twentyfour the kennington of twenty  and the scorpion sloop    the great number of workmen whom this business brought together have given birth by degrees to a populous village  from this busy scene we pursued our way to beaulieuabbey which is about two miles beyond it the road is still close and beautifully wooded within half a mile of it you look down from the higher grounds into the circular valley in which the ruins of the abbey stand  the valley itself is extensive and consists of great variety of ground and the whole scene but especially the hills which surround it are woody through the middle of it runs the river which about two miles above beaulieu is a mere foreststream and has no consequence but what it receives from the beautiful scenes through which it wanders under the walls of the abbey it meets the tide which immediately gives it form and dignity here a bridge is thrown over it on each side of which it spreads into a lake when the tide flows shaping it is ample sweeps around rich wooded shores both these grand basins might easily be kept constantly full if a head were constructed as i have heard it might be across the river at the second reach below the abbey the tide in all probability would not obstruct a work of this kind as it flows here with little force scarce at the rate of four miles an hour  the precincts of the abbey which stands on the eastern side of the river are in circumference about a mile and a half the boundarywall is entire in several parts and visible almost in all the area within the boundary is nearly flat and might easily be made a very beautiful scene along the banks of the river the ground is a little varied where a pleasant walk has been laid out which is now picturesquely marked by the ruins of time the bank is here somewhat higher than the river and was formerly in this part the foundation of the boundarywall of the abbey which when the wall was entire completely hid the river and all it is beautiful appendages from the walk time has now restored them tho the wall yet holds out in some places it has in general failed large portions of it are gone and in other parts there are chasms and fractures through which the river and the surrounding woods appear often to great advantage from the walk old oaks likewise coeval with the abbey itself are scattered profusely around the ruins of the wall sometimes supporting it and sometimes supported by it they are every where beautiful appendages and in many places unite with the ruins of the wall into the most pleasing foregrounds while the river spread here into a lake and the woods beyond it form a distance  among these ruins i remember some years ago to have seen a very extraordinary instance of vegetation the main stem of an oak arose in contact with a part of the wall which was entire and extended one of it is principal limbs along the summit of it this limb at the distance of a few yards from the parenttree finding a fissure in the wall in which there might probably be some deposit of soil shot a root through it into the earth from hence shooting up again through another part of the wall it formed a new stem as large as the original tree and from this again proceeded another horizontal branch like the former in a great storm which happened on the   th of february      both the wall and the tree were blown down together  great part of the area between this beautiful walk and the abbey is occupied by an open grove part of which is beautiful and part deformed the reason of the difference is that one part is planted carelessly by the hand of nature the other regularly by that of art  of the buildings of the abbey considerable parts remain enough to show that it has formerly been constructed in a rich gothic style tho it is dimensions were never large the parts still in being of most consequence are what is supposed to have been the refectory and the abbots lodge the refectory is now turned into a parish church and forms a handsome aile which is worth looking into the abbots lodge is known by the name of the palace and was fitted up by the predecessor of the last duke of montague as a mansion tho he made little addition to it the old hall still remains and some of the other apartments what he added is illdone and what he did in the way of taste is whimsical and illmanaged he did nothing indeed that adorns this beautiful scene many things which deform it and some things so strangely absurd that no genius but his own could have conceived them instead of calling in some man of taste to assist him in making beaulieuabbey one of the most pleasing scenes in england which it might have been he employed an engineer by whose help he drew a ditch around it filled it with water threw two or three drawbridges over it secured all the avenues and thus by a wonderful stroke of art converted an abbey into a castle this achievement was performed about the time of a french war and a rebellion when the duke had been raising a regiment and his ideas had taken a military turn it is said too that he made this strange metamorphosis under an apprehension lest some adventrous french privateer taking the advantage of a fulltide might sail up the river and endeavor to carry him off  men of taste cannot enough lament that a situation so well adapted to receive the beauties of art should have fallen so unhappily into such wretched hands and that more money had been spent in deforming it than might have made it a scene of uncommon beauty  of the other parts of the abbey little remains there is a court about sixty or seventy feet square formerly perhaps a cloister which is now converted into a garden in the inner walls remain several arches now closed two or three of which are of beautiful gothic near this court also stands a small room roughly arched the arches are of stone centering in a point at the top but it does not easily appear for what purpose so small an apartment was intended the kitchen is still very entire as this edifice often is among the ruins of abbeys it was a structure commonly of great strength  but tho the situation of beaulieuabbey is very pleasing and perhaps more monkish than could easily have been found in the neighborhood yet if a noble familymansion should be intended a much grander situation might be chosen in many parts of this beautiful country particularly on the high grounds a little to the north of bucklershard nearly about the point where the road from thence unites with that from lymington this situation commands a grand sweep over the river together with it is estuary  the woods on both sides of it which are rich and ample in a high degree  and in the distance the channel and the high grounds of the isle of wight from cowes point to the needles  the privileges of the manor of beaulieu which were granted by king john were very extensive and are still preserved no debtor can be arrested within it is precincts unless the lords leave be obtained the lords of beaulieu also enjoy the liberties of the cinqueports and the same exemption from duties which was the dukes principal reason as was observed see page      for building a town at bucklershard they hunt also and destroy the kings deer if they stray within the purlieus of the abbey on the day we were at beaulieu we found the hedges every where beset with armed men there were not fewer than twenty or thirty it appeared as if some invasion was expected on inquiry we were informed a stag had been seen that morning in the manor and all the village of beaulieu was in arms to prevent his escape back into the forest the fortunate man who shot him had a gratuity from the lord  beaulieumanor is an extensive scene being not less than twentyeight miles in circumference it consists chiefly of woodlands and besides the deer which accidentally stray into it from the forest contains a great number of deer in it is own domains among these rough grounds are intermixed many valuable farms and the whole yields annually about l  000  as we leave beaulieuabbey along the lyndhurst road we skirt the upper lake which is formed by the tide above the bridge it is a beautiful sheet of water about a mile in circumference surrounded on every side with woods which in many parts fall into it from the rising grounds as the view opens we look full up the lake on the right the abbey appears among the woods to great advantage on the left a winding road runs along it is margin except where in some parts it is intercepted by clumps of trees in front the woods recede a little from the water and leave a space of flat meadow which has a good effect in contrast with the rising grounds and woods on each side  the whole scene is pleasing soon after we leave the lake the river dwindles into a sluggish little bullrush stream the meadow however through which it winds are adorned with wood and still continue beautiful  at a place called the fightingcocks well known to the lurking poacher the manor of beaulieu ends and we entered the wild scenes of the forest deep woods received us through these we rode near two miles rising gently from the river and then emerged into an open scene called culverlyheath  one of those beautiful woodyskirted lawns of which we had seen so many in the western parts of the forest and yet the features of this were different from them all  we stood on a rough knoll decorated with a few fullgrown oaks descending in front into a lawn which appeared to stretch about a mile in front and a league on each side it was skirted in every part with woods shooting out and retiring in skreens on each side and folding over each other the whole was a pleasing piece of forestperspective and the lawn one of the most picturesque compositions we had met with in this mode of landscape  soon after we left culverlyheath we entered another scene of the same kind  larger but less varied in culverlyheath the materials of landscape were brought together in so perfect a manner as to produce a picturesque whole here through an awkwardness in the composition there was but an indifferent whole tho many of the parts in themselves were beautiful  from this heath we entered a large wood called denny it has once been a noble scene but it is now stripped of it is principal honors and consists chiefly of beech with a few decrepid oaks straggling among them every where we saw noble stools as they call the stumps of such trees as have been cut down and could form an idea of their grandeur by the respectful space they have formerly occupied none of the trees in the neighborhood seem to have approached within a considerable distance of them  in this wood which makes a part of dennywalk the lodge belonging to it is seated here we left the lyndhurst road which we had thus far pursued from beaulieu and turning to the left directed our course to whitleyridgelodge in the neighborhood of this place we found some beautiful scenes one of them has peculiar merit  it is a small forestlawn containing about seven or eight acres somewhat circular and skirted with oaks thickets and open groves but they are disposed in so happy a manner and so much broken by clumps standing out from the other woods that all the regularity of it is form is removed this lawn is the favorite haunt of deer in summerevenings and their constant feeding upon it has given the finest texture to it is turf it is rough enough to show it is alliance with the forest but like some of natures fairest forms it has so polished an appearance that with the smallest improvement it might accompany the most cultivated scene  from hence we continued our rout through woods like those of denny as far as ladycrosslodge these ravaged parts of the forest tho they still afford many pleasing scenes yet deprived of their noblest trees are deprived also of their principal beauty tho inferior wood as we had frequent opportunity to observe might produce distant scenery yet when we enter the internal parts of a forest we wish for objects of grandeur in forestglades especially where the scenes are small large trees on the foreground are almost necessary  from the woods of ladycross we entered the western side of that vast heath which occupies all the middle ground between the rivers of lymington and beaulieu  it is not a scene like that of culverly and others in which the woods and open country bear a proportion to each other it is diffuse and unadorned the circumambient woods are too inconsiderable and yet it is every where surrounded with them those of heathydilton occupied the right and introduced as we skirted this side of the heath some little scenery but all other parts were naked in front indeed ranged a meagre skirting of wood beyond which the high grounds of the isle of wight formed a distance  as we proceeded farther on this heath norleywood arose at some distance on the left toward this across the heath we bent our course as we were told it afforded some of the most beautiful internal scenery of any part of the forest  norleywood stretches about two miles in length and taking a semicircular turn forms some heathy grounds which hang to the south into a bay  as a distant object however it is woods possess only common beauties to see it is oaks in their glory we must enter it is recesses their forms are remarkably picturesque and their combinations are as pleasing as their forms these combinations are greatly assisted by a profusion of holly and other humble plants which are interspersed among the trees  this delightful scenery also is happily opened several roads winding in different directions through the wood form a variety of little recesses sometimes we were presented with a longer reach sometimes with a sudden turn and the beauty generally arose from seeing little removed clumps of wood in waterlos style variously rising behind one or two stately trees on the foreground whose dark branches gave their enlightened foliage effect other varieties are introduced by the intersections of roads and others by the grass running among fullgrown trees or clumps of underwood where frequent tufts of holly box or thorn steal on the greenswerd but admit fair space for many a mossy maze to wind between in short we found instances here in great perfection of every mode of scenery which i have already described in the internal parts of a forest see vol i page       there is also a circumstance connected with this wood which is rarely found in those woods which occupy the middle regions of the forest and that is a hamlet of those little trespassing cottages scattered about it which have already been mentioned see vol i page      they commonly stand detached and one or other of them meets the eye in various parts and adds much to the scene i have already explained how far such circumstances affect both natural and artificial landscape see vol i page       in a few years however all the beautiful scenery of norleywood will vanish it is destruction has long been expected and was lately determined in the beginning of the year      a band of woodcutters entered it with orders from the surveyor of the forest to cut a hundred of the best trees which he had previously marked for the use of the navy these trees were set apart for building ships of the first and second rates the next year another fall of the same kind of timber was ordered and in three or four years when all the noble trees are gone the refuse will be destined to ships of inferior size frigates sloops and cutters during seven years it is supposed this wood will yield a considerable supply to the yards of portsmouth at present however a respite is given it and the depredations which have been made have not yet greatly injured it is beauty in some parts they may have improved it see vol i page      by several openings which the woodcutters have made tho the scenes of norleywood admit improvements of this kind less than almost any other scenes in the forest as they naturally abound in openings and recesses if a few more attacks however be made upon it it is glory will be extinct and norleywood like other ravaged woods will suggest only the remembrance of a scene  and yet the various appendages of woodcutting  piles of bark and scattered boughs and timberwains are not unpleasing objects see vol i page      the deep hollow tone also of the woodmans axe or of axes responsive to each other in different parts of the wood are notes in full harmony with the scene tho their music is a knell  the fallen tree also lying with it is white peeled branches on the ground is not only beautiful in itself but if it be not scattered in too great profusion for white is an unaccommodating hue it forms an agreeable contrast with the living trees but when we see it deprived of it is beautiful ramification squared and sawn in lengths as it sometimes continues long to lie about the forest it becomes an object of deformity and we lament what it once was without receiving any equivalent from it is present state  it may here also be remarked that the kings timber is much more picturesque than such timber as is bought and cut by the merchant he with cautious and discerning eye stands at the bottom of the tree while it is yet alive and having examined every twisting limb and destined every part to it is proper service lops them off one by one and then fells the tree a deformed and mutilated trunk the royal woodcutter is less nice he fells the tree as it grows and leaves the dockmen to ascertain the uses of it is several parts two or three of the main limbs are generally reft and splintered in the fall but that is not his concern in the mean time the ruin of the whole with all it is spreading parts about it retains still a degree of picturesque beauty  sect viii a voyage up beaulieuriver  the river avon is the boundary of the forest on the west and the bay of southampton on the east neither of these rivers therefore properly belongs to the forest the only rivers which may justly be called forestrivers are those of lymington and beaulieu the former of these we have already examined in various parts the latter only about the abbey of beaulieu we determined therefore to investigate the whole by a voyage  we took boat in lymingtonriver which at low water winds beautifully before it enter the sea see page     its banks indeed are mud but of the best species for they are covered like the other mudlands of this country with seagrass which gives them the air of meadows when the tide retires the returning water overruns all the boundaries of the river and makes it necessary for the use of vessels of any burden to mark its channel with stakes  the mouth of the river is distinguished by a larger post known among fishermen by the name of jack in the basket it stands about three miles from lymingtonharbour  at this boundary we entered the channel which divides the coast of hampshire from the isle of wight the former which stretches along the left appears as a flat woody distance just raised above the edge of the water and unmarked by any object of consequence they who are acquainted with the country can point out here and there a house just seen among the trees  on the right the isle of wight makes a better appearance and yet not a picturesque one it consists of a double ridge of high lands which in almost every part are illshaped and in some parts the upper and lower grounds follow each other in a disagreeable parallel indeed we seldom see a continuation of high grounds through a space of near ten miles forming so unpleasant a delineation at least it seems such to any eye assimulated to the grandeur of a mountainous country  the waterline of the island appears to more advantage among many smaller indentations of the coast the bays of totland and newtown are considerable totlandbay is formed by the western point of the island called the needlecliffs on one side and on the other by that promontary which shoots out opposite to hurstcastle usually called sconcepoint it is a rude wild scene tho the cliffs themselves are rather of the tame species without any of those large parts and projections which give a rocky coast its most picturesque form newtownbay affords an opening of a different kind it is a semicircular sweep into a country highly cultivated which at a proper distance when the several objects of cultivation are massed together has a good effect  as we approached the mouth of beaulieuriver it is opening promised little the eastern side forms a low lineal disagreeable shore the western side is still more disagreeable it consists of a flat tongue of land called needsorepoint needsore that is needsshore but the sh was not used is saxon orthography hence needsore stansore and other terminations of that kind on this coast and windsor hedsor etc on the thames  which runs out a considerable way and at low water unites with the mudlands when the tide flows it is in part covered with water we found it in this latter situation and our boat made a short push over it instead of going round by the mouth of the river  it is somewhat remarkable that there is one of these spits of land near the mouth of each of these forestrivers and also at the mouth of southamptonbay hurstcastle formerly intended to guard the passage through the needles occupies one near the mouth of lymingtonriver and calshotcastle another at the entrance of southamptonbay on needsorepoint which is the middle one a fortress was thought unnecessary  but tho these spits of land are remarkable they are easily accounted for the united force of wind and tide from the southwest and west so much greater and more continued than from any other quarter is the natural and obvious cause the same thing happens at the entrance of portsmouthharbour spithead is the barrier of it is channel which runs close along the eastern shore under southseacastle and portsmouthwall much in the same manner as the channel of beaulieu or rather exburyhaven runs close under the shore from leap wherever there is a low or gravelly coast undefended on the southern side of our island it gives way to the fury of the atlantic winds and tides the rocks of purbeck protect the gravelly coast about pool and christchurch to the east of these places there have certainly been depredations wight defends portsmouth and the shores eastward as far as arundel which would probably go to sea if they were equally unprotected from the west as from the east  we had now entered beaulieuriver which appears to be about half a mile broad for some time needsorepoint on the left continued a low winding shore closing us in behind tedious and unvaried but on the other side the grounds began to form a beautiful bank  as the reach opened the skreens improved the high grounds about exbury formed themselves into a point covered with wood through which exbury chapel just appeared the other sideskreen was composed of ancient woods where the axe seemed never to have entered the river still continued as wide as at the entrance stretching in front into an ample bay confined by woods but the extremity of the bay was softened by it is length into a seconddistance  by degrees we began to wind round exburypoint which still continued a principal feature in the view but tho it had greatly changed it is appearance the woods and meadows and rough grounds were still very agreeably intermixed on the other side the woods had taken a sweep with the river and were thrown into good perspective they mantled down almost to the water which was bordered only by a narrow edging of meadow here the river affording easy access to the herds of the neighboring pastures they came down for refreshment during the sultry hours of a summernoon while they cooled themselves in the river the woods behind sheltered them from the sun and formed a good background to their several picturesque groups  the front of this grand reach maintained long the same appearance consisting chiefly of woody grounds softened by distance nor did the sideskreens vary much continued woods still rose on the left and on the right a portion of rough pasturage mingled with them  we now came in sight of bucklershard see an account of bucklershard page     the word hard signifies only a firm causeway made upon the mud for the sake of landing on the left where the large timberyards houses and ships on the stocks made a violent chasm in the landscape a quantity of timber scattered about a yard makes a very unpicturesque appearance  it affords a variety of parts without a whole and yet in a timberyard there are sheds and other circumstances which are not wholly void of picturesque images in a ship on the stocks through every stage as it advanes there is a degree of beauty which consists chiefly in the variety of it is sweeping lines  at bucklershard the reach of the river is very interesting on the right are the woods of beaulieu winding round with great richness into a frontskreen on the left where wood before abounded the grounds now run more into pasturage tho far from being destitute of furniture one decoration they have which is not unpleasing where the meadows fall down to the water they are secured from the tide by low staked banks which follow the winding banks of the river if they had run in a straight line they would have been a great deformity but as they wind instead of being offensive objects they give a sort of rough irregular termination to the line of the river if we painted the scene we should have no objection to introduce them both for the reason given and also for the sake of the reflections they form in the water  they have sometimes also the beauty of contrast when the other parts of the bank are without them  from bucklershard the river takes a sweep to the right the woods likewise on that side follow it is course and spreading in great luxuriance to the waters edge throw a gloom over half the river a noble bay landlocked with wood begins soon to open  as this scene removes the woods take a different form shaping themselves into removed skreens following each other  another reach brought us within fight of beaulieu  the bridge and the abbey forming the center of the view the river in the mean time losing very little of it is grandeur from the first reach to the last  thus we finished our voyage up the river of beaulieu which in a course of near three leagues from the sea forms about five or six grand sweeps  the simple idea it presents throughout is that of a winding tideriver flowing up a woody and uninhabited country which is a singular character for an english river to assume here and there we see a house and a few spots of cultivation but so little that they make no impression on the general character of the scene the picturesque eye used to landscape easily overlooks these little obstacles and carries on the general idea undisturbed  the busy scene of shipbuilding at bucklershard rather aided than injured the idea for as no one would expect a scene of this kind in so retired a place it seemed as if the adventurers who had sailed up the river had landed here either to refit their ships or to build others for the purpose of pursuing their discoveries  miratur nemus insuetum fulgentia long scuta virum fluvio pictasque innare carinas the idea of a wild country in a natural state however picturesque is to the generality of people but an unpleasing one there are few who do not prefer the busy scenes of cultivation to the grandest of natures rough productions in general indeed when we meet with a description of a pleasing country we hear of haycocks or waving cornfieldsd or laborers at their plough or other circumstances and objects which the picturesque eye always wishes to exclude the case is the spectator sympathises in the joys of a country which arise from the prospect of plenty and associating these ideas with the country itself he calls it picturesque by which he means only that it pleases him  thus too in the grand and sublime scenes of nature if there be any mixture of horror in them which often adds greatly to the picturesque effect the associated ideas of unhappiness cloud the scene and make it displeasing  i mean not when a person is among objects which in their remote consequences give delight or in the midst of scenes which are connected with distress that he should not feel the natural impressions they make  all i mean is to investigate the sources of beauty to limit the different modes of pleasure and pain to separate causes and effects and to evince that a scene tho it abound with circumstances of horror may be very picturesque while another may be entirely the reverse tho replete with incidents that produce joy and happiness  i have an instance at hand to my purpose one of our voyagers capt king who succeeded capt cook p  0  to the northern seas in sailing up a river thus describes the scene  the country says he on each side was very romantic but unvaried the river running between mountains of the most craggy and barren aspect where there was nothing to diversify the scene but now and then the sight of a bear or flights of wildfowl so uninteresting a passage leaves me nothing farther to add  it is hardly possible in so few words to present more picturesque ideas of the horrid and savage kind we have a river running up a country broken on both sides with wild romantic rocks which we know nature never constructs in a uniform manner we naturally therefore conclude they ran out in some parts into vast diagonal strata on the ledges of which a bear or two appeared sitting on their hams or howling at the boat in other parts the rocks would form lofty promontories hanging over the river and inhabited by numerous flights of seafowl screaming around them this is not an imaginary picture but copied with exactness from captain kings sketch  and yet he has no conception that a scene so savage could present any other ideas than such as were disgusting he calls it an unvaried scene by which expression he meant nothing i am persuaded but that the rocks were neither intermixed with villages nor with scenes of cultivation wood might probably be wanting but in a scene of picturesque horror wood is by no means a necessary appendage it is rather indeed an improper one flourishing wood at least is out of place the scene might perhaps admit here and there a scathed and ragged pine  beyond beaulieu our boat could not pass thus far only the tide flows with any force at beaulieu therefore we waited till the tide turned when we again embarked  the views in ascending and descending a river vary considerably through it is several reaches yet the difference tho observable enough cannot easily be described language wants colors to paint such nice distinctions we shall therefore fall down the river with a quicker sail than we ascended and yet we must not leave it is retrospect views entirely unobserved  the bay formed by the circling woods in the second reach as we descend is very beautiful i know not whether it is form is not more pleasing than we thought it in the morning  the next reach loses in beauty a long stretch of low land sweeping across the river like a mole which was less observable before now greatly interrupts the beauty of the view  the succeeding bay where the woods of exbury open in front is very grand and extensive  from bucklershard nothing can unite more happily than the rough uncultivated grounds of exbury on the left with the long succession of beaulieu woods on the right  after this the river soon becomes an estuary when we entered it as we looked up the stream we had immediately the idea of a river winding into a woodland country in the same manner when we descended we had as quickly an idea of a river entering the sea for as the woods in the former case become at once the center of the view so does the sea and the isle of wight in the latter the last reach therefore of the river continues long to exhibit a kind of mixed scenery exburypoint and the woody grounds about it still preserve the idea of the beautiful woodland scenes we had left while needsorepoint tho it wind quite around and shut us within a landlocked bay is yet so low that the sea and the island appear beyond it  on opening the mouth of the river our boatmen attempted to carry us across the mudlands as they had done in the morning but they found it dangerous and desisted for if a boat should only touch the ground the delay of a few minutes might endanger her sticking till the return of the tide so rapidly do the waters retreat  as the tide was thus leaving the mudlands flights of seagulls hovered round watching on that event to pick up the little wreck that remained seafowl are the common appendages of all estuaries indeed few masters in landscape omit them   aeneas ingentem ex aequore aeneas did not see the grove ex aequore from his ship  but he saw it rising ex aequore from the waters edge lucum prospicit hunc inter fluvio tiberinus amaeno vorticibus rapidis et multa flavus arena in mare prorumpit variae circumque supraque assuetae ripis volueres et fluminis alveo aethera mulcebant contu lucoque volabant again ceu quondam nivei liquida inter nubila cygni cum sese e pastu referunt et longa canoros dant per colla modos sonat amnis  and again  piscoso amne padusae dant sonitum ranci per stagna loquacia cygni on such classical authority we admire the flights of seagulls as a proper ornament in a scene like this it was amusing to observe how quickly they discovered the relinquished shore long before it was discoverable by us and to see them running in appearance on the surface of the water for tho the tide had in those parts left the land yet the mud from it is perfect flatness long retained it is glazed and watery appearance  the cormorant also sat watching the ebbing tide but he seemed bent on matters of greater importance he did not like the idle gull wheel round the air nor pace about the ebbing shore mixing business and amusement together with eager attention he took his stand on some solitary post set up to point the channel of the river and from that eminence observed from the dimpling of the waters where some poor wandering fish had gotten himself entangled in the shallows whom he marked for certain destruction  but these are not the only birds which inliven a voyage up beaulieuriver in the lines i have just quoted from virgils description of aeneass entrance into the tyber the whole of which might serve with very little alteration for a description also of beaulieuriver two kinds of birds are introduced  those which disport themselves in fluminis alveo and those which aethera mulcebant cantu lucoque volabant with the actions of the former of these we have already been entertained but we have not yet listened to the music of the latter i have been told it is extraordinary and that all these woods on both sides of the river so extensive are they and unmolested are filled with such innumerable flights of singing birds that to sail up the river in a morning or an evening in the spring affords in virgils language an avium concentus hardly any where else to be found the nightingale the thrush the blackbird and the linnet are the chief performers in the concert some of these you hear continually bursting out either at hand or from a distance while the various petty chirpers of the woods join the chorus and tho alone their little untuneable voices might be harsh yet all together one softening the discordancy of another they make a kind of melody or at least an agreeable contrast to such of the band as are better skilled in their business  i cannot leave this riverscene without observing that although it is picturesque in a high degree yet it exhibits such a specimen of the picturesque if i may speak in terms seemingly contradictory as is not well calculated to make a picture the whole is a succession of those softer nameless beauties which highly please but cannot easily be described various beautiful accompaniments are exhibited but striking objects are wanting if every reach had been adorned with a castle or a picturesque rock such as capt kings uninteresting river would have afforded each successive scene would have been more picturesquely marked tho the character of the river on the whole might have been injured but now the whole plays upon the eye in the same pleasing tho unvaried colors a strong and peculiar character belongs to the river in general but the parts if i may so express myself are lost in the whole they are every where beautiful but no where characteristic    sect ix an excursion along the eastern side of beaulieu river  the coast opposite to the isle of wight  the western side of southampton bay  and thence by dibden again to beaulieu  at beaulieu we crossed the bridge and turning short to the right had a better view of the first reach of the river from the land than we had before in our voyage from the water the river itself had more the appearance of a lake for it was then high water and made a magnificent sweep round a point of wooded land while the woods on the opposite side following it is course on an elevated bank were as rich as a picturesque imagination could conceive them the foreground indeed was not equal to a scene which was in every other respect so complete  from hence we ascended a close lane cut through a corner of beaulieumanor and enriched on both sides but especially on the left with forestscenery at hilltopgate the lane opens into that extensive heath which occupies all the middle part of the peninsula between the river of beaulieu and the bay of southampton as this peninsula shoots into length rather than breadth the heathy grounds follow it is form and extend several miles in one direction tho seldom above two in the other the banks of both rivers are woody and these woods appeared as we entered the heath to skirt it is extremities through these extremities containing the most beautiful parts of the country we meant to travel at hilltop therefore instead of crossing the heath we turned short into a road on the right which led us along the skirts of the woods under the shade of which we traveled about a mile sometimes these woods shot like promontories into the heath and we were obliged to ride round them but oftener our road threading the clumps and single trees which stood forward carried us among them the richness and closeness of the forestscenery on one side contrasted with the plainness and simplicity of the heath on the other skirted with distant wood and seen through the openings of the clumps were pleasing  from this heath we were received by lanes  but such lanes as a forest only can produce in which oak and ash fullgrown and planted irregularly by the hand of nature stood out in various groups and added a new foreground every step we took to a variety of little openings into woods copses and pleasing recesses  while we were admiring these close landscapes the woods on the right suddenly giving way we were presented with a view of the river  bucklershard beyond it  the men of war building in the dock there  and the woody grounds which rise in the offskip this exhibition was rather formally introduced like a vista the woods seemed to have been opened on purpose but formality is a fault which we seldom find in nature and which in the scene before us she will probably correct in a few years by the growth of some intervening trees  a mile farther brought us to the seat of colonel mitford among the woods of exbury the house is no object but the scenery consists of a more beautiful profusion of wood water and varied grounds than is commonly to be met with here we proposed to spend the evening but not finding colonel mitford at home we took a ramble into his woods till supper where we expected to meet him  the richness of the scenes had led us imperceptibly from one to another we had every where instances of the beauty of trees as individuals  as uniting in clumps  and as spreading into woods for all here is pure nature and as they were beginning now to put on their autumnal attire we were entertained with the beauties of coloring as well as of form among these unknown woods our way at length became perplexed and the sun was now set having no time therefore to lose we inquired at a lonely cottage which we found in a sheltered glade nothing could indicate peace and happiness more than this little sequestered spot and we expected to find a neat peaceful contented family within but we found that a happy scene will not always make happy inhabitants at the door stood two or three squalid children with eager famished countenances staring through matted hair on entering the hovel it was so dark that we could at first see nothing by degrees a scene of misery opened we saw other ragged children within and were soon struck with a female figure grovelling at full length by the side of a few embers upon the hearth her arms were naked to her shoulders and her rags scarce covered her body on our speaking to her she uttered in return a mixture of obscenity and imprecations we had never seen so deplorable a maniac  we had not observed when we entered what now struck us a man sitting in the corner of the hovel with his arms folded and a look of dejection as if lost in despair we asked him who that wretched person was she is my wife said he with a composed melancholy and the mother of these children he seemed to be a man of great sensibility and it struck us what distress he must feel every evening after his labor when instead of finding a little domestic comfort he met the misery and horror of such a house  the total neglect of his little affairs  his family without any overseer brought up in idleness and dirt  and his wife for whom he had no means of providing either assistance or cure lying so wretched an object always before him  we left him strongly impressed with his calamity which appeared to be a more severe visitation than the hand of heaven commonly inflicts  we found afterward that we had been wholly mistaken and that we had before us a strong instance of that strange fatality by which mankind are so often themselves the ministers of those distresses which they are so ready to ascribe to heaven on relating our adventure at supper we were informed that the man whose appearance of sensibility had affected us so much was one of the most hardened abandoned mischievous fellows in the country  that he had been detected in sheepstealing  and that he had killed a neighbors horse in an act of revenge  and that it was supposed he had given his wife who was infamous likewise a blow in a quarrel which had occasioned her malady  the next morning we took a particular view of the beautiful scenery around us of which the evening before we had only obtained a general idea  the woods of exbury which are extensive are chiefly oak  the spontaneous growth of the country but mr mitford found many of the bare and barren spots about his house planted by his father and grandfather with firgroves of various kinds tho generally according to the fashion of the times in formal rows  on a deliberate view of his grounds he formed a general plan resulting from the various scenes they exhibited  the boundary of his estate presents a series of views of three very different characters  toward the west he has a variety of grand riverviews formed by the ex or as it is commonly at this day called beaulieuriver winding as we had seen it in our voyage through the woods of beaulieu and exbury in it is approach to the sea  the southern part of his boundary overlooks what was anciently called the solentsea but now commonly the channel of the isle of wight which at it is two extremities discovers the open sea through the eastern passage by spithead and through the western by the needles  on the east and north his boundaryviews take a new form we leave the shore and wind into a woodland country which within a hundred yards assumes so new a character that we might easily conceive it to be as many miles from the sea in these woody scenes intermixed with open grounds we continue about four miles till winding round we return to those rising grounds on the west from whence we first had the views of the river  this boundarycircuit carries us through the space of about eight miles mr mitford has done little besides marking it out by cutting through the woods as he should wish to lead it to complete his plan would be very expensive tho an expense equal to the natural advantages of the scene in good hands would make this one of the most varied and picturesque woodlandrides perhaps in england  within this boundarycircuit mr mitford has marked out an interior one circling about a mile round his house as the object of the larger circuit is to show as much as possible the extent of his views the object of this interior one is to break those distant views into parts  to form those parts into the most beautiful scenes and to exhibit them with woody foregrounds to the best advantage from many parts of this interior scenery the isle of wight makes it is most picturesque appearance in various views of it from the hampshire coast we have seen it spread in too lengthened a curtain and it is hills too smooth and tame both these inconveniences are here in a degree obviated seldom more than a small part of the island is seen at once and this part is about the center which is the loftiest and the roughest here rise two considerable hills gatescliff and wraxhill and one of them affords a circumstance of great beauty carisbrokecastle seated on an eminence about four miles within the island is seen very advantageously against gatescliff when the sun shines either on the castle or on the mountain while the other is in shadow  in laying out this inner circle mr mitford had his greatest difficulties to contend with for here he had all his grandfathers formal groves to encounter and it was no easy matter to break their formalities to make judicious inroads through them and unite them in one plan he often lamented  what other improvers have lamented before him  the injudicious sufferance of the growth of trees next to the cutting down of trees improperly the greatest mischief is to let them grow together too long they soon ruin each other he had suffered his woodward only to use his discretion in the distant woods in the groves about his house he allowed no markinghammer but his own the consequence was he was so little on the spot that many of his best trees were injured the fir especially if it is natural branches are once lost as they always are by straitened quarters never recovers them  these two circuits round his house mr mitford has joined by three cross walks  in taking these circuits we could not help remarking the comparative virtue of taste and expense the former with very little of the latter will always produce something pleasing while the utmost efforts of the latter unaided by the former are ineffectual the larger the proportion of misguided expense the wider will the deformity spread whereas every touch in the hand of taste has so far it is effect  it is the same precisely in working the scenes of nature as in forming an artificial scene set two artists at work give one of them a bit of blacklead and a scrap of paper every touch he makes perhaps deserves to be treasured in a cabinet give the other the costliest materials all is a waste of time of labor and expense add colors  they only make his deformities more glaring  true taste in the first place whether in nature or on canvas makes not a single stroke till the general design is laid out with which in some part or other every effort coincides the artist may work at his picture in this part or the other but if his design and composition are fixed every effort is gradually growing into a whole whereas he who works without taste seldom has any idea of a whole he tacks one part to another as his misguided fancy suggests or if he has any plan it is something as unnatural as the parts which compose it are absurd the deeper his pocket therefore and the wider his scale his errors are more apparent  to an injudicious person or one who delights in temples and chinese bridges very little would appear executed in the scenes i have described at exbury there is scarce a gravelwalk made no pavilion raised nor even a whiteseat fixed and yet in fact more is done than if all these decorations and a hundred others had been added unaccompanied with what has been done the greatest difficulty of all is surmounted  that of laying out a judicious plan the rest tho the most ostensible because the most expensive is only a little mechanical finishing  from these pleasing scenes we pursued our journey through part of the beautiful ride we have just described to leap along lanes close on the left but opening to the right in various places to the river which assumes a magnificent form needsorepoint makes here an appearance very different from what it made when we navigated the mouth of beaulieuriver see page   0  it appears now from the higher grounds when the tide is low to run at least a league into the sea flat unadorned and skirted with drifted sand making a singular feature in all these views and the more so as every part of the ground in it is neighborhood is woody bold and prominent this peninsula of which needsorepoint is the termination belongs to the manor of beaulieu it contains some good land consisting chiefly of pasturage and the whole of it is let out in a single farm  in this remote part it is supposed somewhere near exbury the dauphin after his fruitless expedition to england embarked privately on the death of king john for france burning the country behind him as he fled his embarkation from so obscure a place shows in a strong light how much his hopes were humbled  at leap we met the sea where the coast of the isle of wight as far as to spithead on the left makes nearly the same unpicturesque appearance which it does from the other shores of the forest it extends into length and exhibits neither grandeur nor variety when it is seen as we saw it from mr mitfords broken into parts as it should always be when seen to picturesque advantage see page      it afforded several beautiful distances but here when the whole coast was displayed at once it lost it is picturesque form  near leap however we had one very beautiful coastview a rising copse on the left adorned with a road winding through it makes a good foreground from thence a promontory in the second distance with an easy sweeping shore shoots into the sea and is opposed on the opposite side by a point of the island leaving a proper proportion of water to occupy the middle space  leap is one of the porttowns of the forest and as it lies opposite to cowes it is the common place of embarkation in these parts to the island it consists of about half a dozen houses and shelters perhaps as many fishingboats all the coast indeed from st helens to the needles and around the island is in peaceable times a scene of fishing in the whitingseason especially fleets of twenty or thirty boats are often seen lying at anchor on the banks or a little out at sea    fowling too is practiced on this coast as much as fishing numerous flocks of wildfowl frequent it in the winter widgeons geese and ducks and in the beginning of the season especially as they bear a price in the country they of course attract the notice of the fowler as the coast between hampshire and the isle of wight is a peculiar species of coast consisting when the tide ebbs of vast muddy flats covered with green seaweed it gives the fowler an opportunity of practicing arts perhaps practiced no where else  fowling and fishing indeed on this coast are commonly the employments of the same person he who in summer with his line or his net plies the shores when they are overflowed by the tide in winter with his gun as evening draws on runs up in his boat among the little creeks and crannies which the tide leaves in the mudlands and there lies in patient expectation of his prey  seafowl commonly feed by night when in all their multitudes they come down to graze on the savannahs of the shore as the sonorous cloud advances for their noise in the air resembles a pack of hounds in full cry the attentive fowler listens which way they bend their course perhaps he has the mortification to hear them alight at too great a distance for his gun tho of the longest barrel to reach them and if he cannot edge his boat a little round some winding creek which it is not always in his power to do he despairs of success that night  perhaps however he is more fortunate and has the satisfaction to hear the airy noise approach nearer till at length the host settles on some plain on the edge of which his little boat lies moored he now as silently as possible primes both his pieces anew for he is generally doublearmed and listens with all his attention it is so dark that he can take no aim for if he could see the birds they also could see him and being shy and timorous in a great degree would seek some other pasture though they march with music they feed in silence some indistinct noises however if the night be still issue from so large a host he directs his piece therefore as well as he can toward the sound gives his fire at a venture and instantly catching up his other gun gives a second discharge where he supposes the flock to rise on the wing  his gains for the night are now decided and he has only to gather his harvest he immediately puts on his mudpattens mudpattens are flat pieces of board which the fowler ties to his feet that he may not sink in the mud  ignorant yet of his success and goes groping about in the dark happy if he have a little starlight in quest of his booty picking up perhaps a dozen and perhaps not one  so hardly does the poor fowler earn a few shillings exposed in an open boat during a solitary winternight to the weather as it comes rain hail or snow on a bleak coast a league perhaps from the beach and often in danger without great care of being fixed in the mud where he would become an inevitable prey to the returning tide i have heard one of these poor fellows say he never takes a dog with him on these expeditions because no dog could bear the cold which he is obliged to suffer  after all perhaps others enjoy more from his labors than he himself does for it often happens that the tide next day throws on different parts of the shore many of the birds which he had killed but could not find in the night  i have heard of an unhappy fowler whom this hazardous occupation led into a case of still greater distress in the day time too it happened which shows the double danger of such expeditions in the night  mounted on his mudpattens he was traversing one of these mudlandplains in quest of ducks and being intent only on his game he suddenly found the waters which had been brought forward with uncommon rapidity by some peculiar circumstance of tide and current had made an alarming progress around him incumbered as his feet were he could not exert much expedition but to whatever part he ran he found himself completely invested by the tide in this uncomfortable situation a thought struck him as the only hope of safety he retired to that part of the plain which seemed the highest from it is being yet uncovered by water and striking the barrel of his gun which for the purpose of shooting wildfowl was very long deep into the mud he resolved to hold fast by it as a support as well as a security against the waves and to wait the ebbing of the tide a common tide he had reason to believe would not in that place ave reached above his middle but as this was a springtide and brought in with so strong a current he durst hardly expect so favorable a conclusion  in the mean time the water making a rapid advance had now reached him it covered the ground on which he stood  it rippled over his feet  it gained his knees  his waist  button after button was swallowed up  till at length it advanced over his very shoulders with a palpitating heart he gave himself up for lost still however he held fast by his anchor his eye was eagerly in search of some boat which might accidentally take it is course that way but none appeared a solitary head floating on the water and that sometimes covered by a wave was no object to be descried from the shore at the distance of half a league nor could he exert any sounds of distress that could be heard so far  while he was thus making up his mind as the exigence would allow to the terrors of sudden destruction his attention was called to a new object he thought he saw the uppermost button of his coat begin to appear no mariner floating on a wreck could behold a cape at sea with greater transport than he did the uppermost button of his coat but the fluctuation of the water was such and the turn of the tide so slow that it was yet some time before he durst venture to assure himself that the button was fairly above the level of the flood at length however a second button appearing at intervals his sensations may rather be conceived than described and his joy gave him spirits and resolution to support his uneasy situation four or five hours longer till the waters had fully retired  a little beyond leap we were interrupted by a creek which when the tide flows high runs considerably into the land and forms a large piece of water at all times it is an extensive marsh it is borders are edged with rushes and sedges which grow profusely also on various little rough islands on it is surface here the wildduck and the widgeon find many a delightful cover amidst which they breed and rear their young in great abundance  near this part of the coast stands lutterels tower built as the station of a view but as it is intended for a habitable house likewise the offices which it could not contain are constructed of canvas around it it is finished in the highest style of expense and if it were not for the oddness and singularity of the conception and contrivance it is not entirely destitute of some kind of taste but the building is so whimsical and the end so inadequate to the expense that we considered it on the whole as a glaring contrast to those pleasing scenes we had just examined at exbury in which true taste had furnished us with a delightful entertainment at a trifling expense see page       the view which this tower commands over the circumjacent country is very extensive but it is seaview is most admired stretching from the bay of southampton to portsmouth  form thence to st helens  and on the other side all along the range of the isle of wight and beyond the needles to the ocean the whole together forms the appearance of a magnificent bay of which spithead and st helens where there is commonly a fleet at anchor make the central part  but this view like the other extensive views we have seen is by no means picturesque it might have been supposed that the isle of wight on surveying it is appearance in a map would have made such an angle at cowespoint which is nearly opposite to this tower as would have thrown the eastern part of the island into better perspective than the western assumes from any part of the hampshire coast and so indeed in some degree it does but the eye is at too great a distance to get much advantage from this circumstance if the spectator were carried nearer cowes the coast toward st helens might then fall away in good perspective but at this distance all is sea the coast is a mere thread and the whole view together is without proportion  and yet it is not merely the disproportion between land and water which disqualifies a view of this kind in a picturesque light a picturesque view may consist entirely of water  nor is it distance which disqualifies it the most remote distances are happily introduced on canvas but what chiefly disqualifies it is the want of foreground to balance this vast expanse of distance unless distances and foregrounds are in some degree balanced no composition can be good foregrounds are essential to landscape distances are not  a picturesque view as was observed may consist chiefly indeed entirely of water but then it is supposed that as there cannot be a natural foreground an artificial one must be obtained  a group of ships  a few boats with figures  a lighthouse  or something that will make a balance between near and distant objects such were the seapieces of vandervelt in which vessels of some kind were always introduced to make an artificial foreground we sometimes indeed meet with amusing views such as that celebrated one at hackfall in yorkshire see observations on the lakes and mountains of cumberland vol ii p      where there is a gradual proportion among the different parts of the retiring landscape we can scarce distinguish where the foregrounds end and where the distance begins yet still there are objects nearer the eye which in a degree set off the retiring parts tho they may not be fully proportioned to them but the most advanced parts of water cannot form a foreground if i may so speak it wants on it is nearest parts that variety of objects which receiving strong impressions of light and shade are necessary to give it consequence and strength it turns all into distance such is the view before us over the channel and along the shores of the isle of wight to the imagination it is the simple idea of grandeur to the eye a mere exhibition of distance  besides there is not only a want of natural proportion and balance between the foreground and the offskip but a foreground here could not even artificially be obtained because of the loftiness of the point take the same view from a lower stand from the level of the sea for instance or a little higher where you may station a group of ships the masts and sails of which rise above the horizon and by thus giving the view a proper and proportioned foreground you may turn it into one of vandervelts compositions and give it picturesque beauty  but tho the view before us is not picturesque it is certainly as we observed of those other views over the island see p      in a great degree amusing the whole area constantly overspread with vessels of various kinds is a perpetual moving scene while the naked eye discovers in the distance a thousand objects and through a telescope a thousand more tho the telescopic pleasures of the eye are very little allied to the pleasures of the painter they still assist the amusement  the cliff on which this tower stands is about forty or fifty feet high and is formed into a terrace which runs a considerable way along the beach  about a mile from this whimsical building stands calshotcastle situated like the castle of hurst see p     on a tongue of land shooting into the sea calshot is another of those ancient coastcastles which henry viii built out of the spoils of the abbeys it was originally intended as a safeguard to the bay of southampton  the views here are of the same nature as those at lutterels tower they have a less extensive range to the west but this is compensated by a full view up southamptonbay and they are the more picturesque as the point of view is lower  near the village of fawley which is among the largest villages of the coast stands cadland the seat of mr drummond an edifice of a very different kind from that we had just been surveying tho quite plain it is one of the most elegant and seems to be one of the most comfortable houses in the country  it stands on a gentle eminence on the banks of southamptonbay with a great variety of ground playing beautifully around it which is every where adorned and in some places profusely covered with ancient wood the whole country indeed was so well wooded that no addition of wood was any where necessary in many parts it was redundant this abundance of old timber gives the house tho lately built so much the air and dignity of an ancient mansion that mr brown the ingenious improver of it used to say it was the oldest new place he knew in england the clumps particularly he has managed with great judgment we observed some combinations of ash and other trees which were equal to any clumps we had ever seen they adorned the natural scene and were just such as the picturesque eye would wish to introduce in artificial landscape we regretted that the great storm in february      had blown down nineteen of these ornamental trees there seemed however no deficiency tho i doubt not if we had known the situation of those which had fallen we should have found they filled their station with great propriety the park includes a circuit of about five miles  besides the beauty of the grounds themselves around the house they command all the pleasing distances in their neighbourhoood  southamptonbay  netlyabbey  calshotcastle  spithead  the channel  the isle of wight  st helens  cowes and all the other conspicuous parts of the island and as many of these views are seen with the advantage of grand woody foregrounds they have often an admirable effect  the only thing that appeared affected about this elegant mansion is the parade which accompanies some of the appendant buildings at the small distance of halt a quarter of a mile from the house stands a most splendid farm the stables the cowsheds the pigeonhouse the graneries the barns are all superb in another direction the same honor tho in an inferior degree is paid to poultry this is too much and tends only to lessen the dignity of the principal mansion  as the horse is so nearly connected with his master and contributes so much to his state and convenience we allow so noble an associate to lodge under a roof proportioned to his masters magnificence as he is expected also to be ready at a call and may properly be the object of attention to persons of any rank we allow his magnificent lodging to stand near the mansion to which it appertains at the same time if the stables be expensive they should contribute to the magnificence of the whole by making one of the wings or some other proper appendage of the pile  but for the cowsheds and pigsties they have no title to such notice let them be convenient and neat but let them be simple and unadorned let them stand in some sequestered place where they may not presume to vie with the mansion they depend on but keep a respectful distance herds of cattle are beautiful in a high degree in their proper place among lawns and woods but pent up as they are obliged to be in yards amidst filth and litter they are no objects of beauty neither should their habitations be considered as such ornaments here serve only to call the attention to a nuisance  from cadland we proceeded to hethe through a variety of such beautiful country that we almost thought the house we had just seen might have been better stationed elsewhere in a variety of pleasing situations it is difficult to select the best something or other may excel in each and the eye divided in it is choice is unwilling to lose any thing as we cannot however possess every beauty and every convenience at once we must forego that idea and endeavor to make such a selection as will include the most tho perhaps some striking beauty which we observe in other situations is lost this probably is the case of the elegant mansion we have been surveying no situation perhaps on the whole could have excelled it  the pleasing landscape we met with between cadland and hethe was of a similar kind to what we had already admired  great profusion of fullgrown oak adorning great variety of playing ground but what particularly recommended these scenes were several dips running down to southamptonbay wooded on each side with a rich country beyond the water they were of the same kind with those we admired between christchurch and lymington see page     but much richer and more beautiful two of the most striking of these scenes were from stoblandcommon and near buttsashfarm  at hethe the whole bay of southampton opened in one view before us but the scene it offers is far from being picturesque the opposite shore is long and tedious and the lines of the bay run parallel for tho in fact there are two or three bold openings in it formed by the mouths of rivers yet in the distance which is about a league they are totally lost  hethe is the ferryport to southampton which lies higher up in a diagonal across the bay and upon a neck of land which shoots into it the flowing tide therefore carries the boat quickly to southampton and the ebbing tide returns it as expeditiously to hethe  from hethe to dibden the country if possible improves in beauty the many inequalities of the ground  the profusion of stately trees  the sheltered enclosures appearing every where like beautiful little wooded lawns  the catches here and there of the bay  and above all the broad green winding lanes adorned with clumps standing out in various parts  exhibit a wonderful variety of pleasing landscape i touch general features only for as these woodland scenes are no where strongly marked it is impossible to give any particular detail of them by verbal description one may say of them as we sometimes say of a wellwritten history which runs into a variety of incidents interesting indeed but not replete with any important events that no just idea of the contents of it can be given without referring to the book itself  from dibden we continued our rout northward till we entered a beautiful forest lawn we had found many of these scenes in different parts each of which had something peculiar to itself see p      this too had it is peculiar character it was about two miles in diameter to the eye it is limits appeared circular and it is form descending gently to a wide center had some resemblance to that of a dish yet it was far from a regular scene it is great beauty consisted chiefly in it is noble skreens of forestwood which growing every where around it with great irregularity broke out into the skirts of the area not in clumps which in so large a scene would have had little effect but in corners of woods adding variety to it is limits yet without incroaching on the simplicity and grandeur of the general idea the name of this beautiful and extensive forestscene is houndsdown so named probably from the fair advantage it gives the hound in pursuit if he can drive his chase from the thickets into this open plain it is probable he will there secure him  through the middle of this wide down the lyndhurst road passes to southampton the entrance into it on the lyndhurst side is beautiful particularly between the ninth and tenth stones where the ground is finely diversified with those woody promontories just mentioned as we approach the top of the hill toward southampton the beauty of the scene is gone the extremity is a naked barren boundary one advantage however we obtain from it which is a distance in forestscenery the more valuable as the more uncommon distances are at all times an agreeable part of landscape and unite with every mode of composition here it is introduced at first in it is simplest mode a plain foreground without any ornament is joined to a removed distance without the intervention of any middle ground in a composition of this simple kind it is necessary to break the lines of the foreground which may easily be done by a tree or a group of cattle  as we rise to the verge of the eminence the view inlarges itself the grounds immediately below the eye are overspread with wood and become a second distance beyond which extends a remote one under a proper light this landscape is calculated to produce a good effect the parts are large and if one vast shadow overspread the woods on the nearer grounds an enlightened distance would form a fine contrast  houndsdown is one of the best pasturegrounds in the forest at least in patches and is of course frequented with cattle which are a great addition to it is beauty we rarely pass it in a summerevening without seeing herds of deer grazing in different parts or forestmares with their colts  one thing indeed disfigures it and that is the strait course of the road which bisects it the vista which leads through the forest from brokenhurst to lyndhurst we observed see page     was both great in itself and accompanied with infinite variety and therefore it became both a grand and a beautiful object but a simple strait road like this over a plain has a different effect tho in fact it is grander than a winding road as being more simple and consisting of fewer parts yet as it is at best only a paltry object and has not grandeur sufficient to rouse the imagination see this idea illustrated page      it is on the whole much less pleasing than a road playing before us in two or three large sweeps which would at least have had variety to recommend it and might easily have been contrived without lengthening the journey across it on a trotting horse above two minutes  but in matters of this kind in which surveyors of highroads are concerned we expect beauty only by chance and when we obtain it it is so much gain  in our way to houndsdown we rode past a celebrated spot called the deerleap here a stag was once shot which in the agony of death collecting his force gave a bound which astonished those who saw it it was immediately commemorated by two posts which were fixed at the two extremities of the leap where they still remain the space between them is somewhat more than eighteen yards  about half a mile on the right as we leave houndsdown stands ironshill lodge it occupies a knoll in the middle of a kind of natural irregular vista in front the ground continues rising gently about two miles to lyndhurst the backfront overlooks a wild woody scene into which the vista imperceptibly blends  from houndsdown we returned to beaulieu along the western side of that extensive heath which as i observed see page      occupies the middle district between the river of beaulieu and the bay of southampton in this part it consists of great variety of ground and is adorned with little patches of wood scattered about it and as it is in general the highest ground in it is neighborhood it is not like most of the heaths we have seen terminated by a woody skreen but by distances which being commonly forestscenes are picturesque tho not extensive among these were some woody bottoms on the right which were pleasing  sect x a tour through the northern parts of newforest having now examined those parts of the forest which lie on the south side of the invisible line drawn from ringwood to dibden see page     we proposed next to examine those parts which lie on the north side of it see page      we directed our course first to lyndhurst this village stands high and the church standing still higher is a landmark round the country  tho lyndhurst is but a small place it may be called the capital of the forest here the forestcourts are held and here stands the principal lodge which is known by the name of the kingshouse and is the residence of the lord warden tho it is but an ordinary building an assignment of timber was lately made to put it and some other lodges into better repair  behind the house lies a pleasant sloping field containing about six or seven acres which is planted round with shrubs circled by a gravel walk and secured from cattle by a railed fence i mention this mode of enclosure only because i have often thought it a very good one especially if a field like this consist of sloping ground for the rails which are in many parts hid appear winding in others and the eye is seldom offended  sometimes pleased with pursuing them and taking them up again after they have for a while disappeared there is something also not unpleasing in the perspective of winding rails  i do not however mention a fence of this kind as suitable to a regal mansion or so proper in many cases as a sunk one but only as a simple unaffected manner of enclosing a field near a plain common house and perhaps less offensive than chains wires nets or any of those slight unnatural fences which cannot be hid and yet appear so disproportioned i should wish my rails however to be without ornament and either to be left with their natural color or to be painted of some dingy olivegreen hue if they are of a brightgreen of a white or of any other glaring color they disgust they are at best only disagreeable conveniences ornament makes them objects but above all ornaments we are disgusted with the chinese that zigzag work commonly called chineserailing is very offensive plain simple posts with one two or three rails according to the sort of cattle we wish to exclude make the least disgusting fence  opposite to the royal lodge stands a large square building with a turret at each corner where the kings horses carriages and staghounds are kept  i do not find that the royal lodge of lyndhurst has ever been visited by the sovereign from the time of charles ii till the year      when george iii passed through the forest in his road to weymouth so long a time had elapsed that all the etiquette of receiving a royal visitor was almost forgotten when the day however of his arrival was notified all the keepers dressed in new green uniforms met him on horseback at his entrance into the forest he traveled without guards and was conducted by these foresters to lyndhurst when he alighted from his coach sir charles mills presented him with two white greyhounds by which ceremony he holds certain forestprivileges his majesty and the royal family for the queen and three of the princesses were with him at first dined in public by throwing the windows open and admitting the crowd within the railed lawn but as the populace became rather riotous in their joy there was a necessity to exclude them the royal family however walked abroad in the forest every evening the king spent his mornings in riding and as he rides fast he saw greatest part of the forest and seemed so much pleased with it that he continued at lyndhurst poorly as he was there accommodated from thursday the   th of june till the tuesday following  near lyndhurst stands cuffnells the seat of mr rose it is not placed exactly as might be wished highground rises immediately in front which is always a circumstance to be avoided but mr rose has happily managed an inconvenience which he found he has laid out a very handsome approach which winds to the house under the rising ground and makes it of much less consequence than when the road was carried abruptly down the slope to the house his improvements he has thrown to the backfront where he is leading a very beautiful walk through clumps of old oak winding toward lyndhurst but his improvements are yet incomplete  mr ballard also has a house near lyndhurst which stands high and commands an extensive view the king walked up to it and with his glass continued some time examining the distant objects he was so pleased with it that on leaving it he gave it the name of mountroyal  from lyndhurst along the rumsey road the forest opens beautifully on the right upon a lawn swelling in different parts and supported with wood at various distances this lawn is used as a raceground where the little horses of the forest of which there is a mart at lyndhurst are commonly brought to try their strength and agility  that noble vista which we described after we left brokenhurst see page     is interrupted by lyndhurst but commences again on the other side of the town here however it is of little value it is but ill adorned with wood the trees which are rare scathed and meagre are in general not only ugly but illcombined some formalities also give it a bad effect before it was irregularly great and simple here the road rises to the eye in three regular stages the summit too is formally abrupt the road cut through the wood forms here a gaping chasm opening like a wide portal discovering the naked horizon and making as it were a full pause in the landscape we discover it plainly to be artificial and this hurts the eye the effect is beautiful on the other side of lyndhurst where the chasm of the vista as you approach is filled with the tops of retiring trees which excites the idea of something beyond it and gives it a more natural air  this gaping chasm appears long the striking feature of the view as we rise the hill in our approach to it however the eye is here and there agreeably drawn aside particularly by a forestlawn which presents itself about a mile and a half from lyndhurst opening both on the right and left it is decorated irregularly with wood  rises before the eye  blends itself leisurely with a few scattered trees and clumps which come forward from the distant woods to meet it  and then loses itself imperceptibly in the depths of the forest  somewhere in this part between lyndhurst and rumsey a charitable scheme was projected in favor of a body of palatines who took refuge in england in the reign of queen anne and engaged the humane part of the nation in endeavoring to provide means for their support many benevolent projects were formed and among others this of settling them in newforest and the matter was thought so practicable that it was digested into a regular plan and laid before the lord treasurer godolphin  the arrangement was this a square plot of ground containing four thousand acres was to be marked out and equally divided into four parts by two roads running through it and crossing at right angles in the center each of these four parts was to be subdivided into five so that the whole plot might be proportioned into twenty farms each of two hundred acres this provision of farms being made twenty of the best and most respectable palatine families were to be looked out and put in possession of them the rest were to be daylabourers each farmer was to be entrusted with a capital of two hundred pounds to be exempted from taxes for twenty years and to have an assignment of foresttimber for building and repairs  this scheme which seems to have been welldigested is said to have been first hinted by the famous daniel de foe but got no farther than the treasurers board  whether the soil was thought incapable of being improved or whether it miscarried from being the production of so wild a genius which made it suspected as chimerical  we had now arrived at the summit of the vista which in prospect had appeared so formal on a close approach it is formality wore off and we found ourselves surrounded by beautiful scenery the summit itself is a fine woodedknoll rising on the left and falling on the right into open groves  as we descended the hill on the other side the closewooded scenery still continued beautiful and we found the grand vista better supported with wood  in wooded seenes like these the planoconvexmirror which was mr grays companion in all his tours see grays memoirs page      has a pleasing effect distances indeed reduced to so small a surface are lost it is chiefly calculated for objects at hand mr gray on viewing the ruins of an abbey says they were the truest objects of his glass he had met with any where he does not indeed assign the reason but if he had considered it he might have seen it was because they presented a happy display of present objects see his memoirs page   0  which it shows to more advantage  when we examine nature at large we study composition and effect we examine also the forms of particular objects but from the size of the objects of nature the eye cannot perform both these operations at once if it be engaged in general effects it postpones particular objects and if it be fixed on particular objects whose forms and tints it gathers up with a passing glance from one to another it is not at leisure to observe general effects  but in the minute exhibitions of the convexmirror composition forms and colors are brought closer together and the eye examines the general effect the forms of the objects and the beauty of the tints in one complex view as the colors too are the very colors of nature and equally well harmonized they are the more brilliant as they are the more condensed  in a chaise particularly the exhibitions of the convexmirror are amusing we are rapidly carried from one object to another a succession of highcolored pictures is continually gliding before the eye they are like the visions of the imagination or the brilliant landscapes of a dream forms and colors in brightest array fleet before us and if the transient glance of a good composition happen to unite with them we should give any price to fix and appropriate the scene i got to the parsonage a little before sunset and saw in my glass a picture that if i could transmit to you and fix in all the softness of it is living colors would fairly sell for a thousand pound grays memoirs page   0   after all perhaps the chief virtue of this deception may consist in exhibiting the beauties of nature in a new light thus when we close one eye and look through the lid of the other halfshut we see only the general effect of objects and the appearance is new and pleasing or when we stoop to the ground and see the landscape around us with an inverted eye the effect is pleasing for the same reason we are pleased also when we look at objects through stained glass it is not that any of these modes of vision is superior or even equal to the eye in it is natural state it is the novelty alone of the exhibition that pleases  if the mirror have any peculiar advantage it consists in it is not requiring the eye to alter it is focus which it must do when it surveys the views of nature  the distance requiring one focus and the foreground another this change of the focus in theory at least i doubt whether in practice occasions some confusion in the mirror we survey the whole under one focus  on the other hand the mirror has at least one disadvantage objects are not presented with that depth that gradation that rotundity of distance if i may so speak which nature exhibits but are evidently affected by the two surfaces of the mirror which give them a flatness something like the scenes of a playhouse retiring behind each other  the convexmirror also diminishes distances beyond nature for which the painter should always make proper allowance or to speak perhaps more properly it inlarges foregrounds beyond their proportion thus if you look at your face in a speculum of this kind you will see your nose magnified the retiring parts of your face will appear of course diminished  about a mile beyond the woody summit we had passed we entered another forestlawn which tho very confined has it is beauty as all these openings must have however confined if surrounded with ancient wood but about half a mile farther where the romsey and salisbury roads divide another forestlawn of much larger dimensions presents itself this is very spacious well hung with wood and what in all these scenes adds greatly to their beauty adorned in various parts with woody promontories shooting into it and clumps and single trees scattered about it on an eminence near this lawn stands a new house belonging to mr gilbert it seems to enjoy a good situation but we did not ride up to it  in this part of the forest are a few scattered houses known by the name of cadenam remarkable for standing near that celebrated oak of which i have given an account in the early part of this work see vol i p       not far from hence lies paultons the seat of mr welbore ellis  paultons was one of the first works of mr brown and therefore deserves the attention of the curious tho in itself indeed it is a pleasing scene the situation of the house is that of an abbey low sheltered and sequestered it is contained within a paled boundary of about five miles in circumference but the whole is so woody that the boundary is no where visible when mr brown first undertook this place it was full of ancient timber and nothing was wanting but to open the area judiciously into ample lawns screened with wood  a polished scene like this in the midst of a forest addresses us with the air of novelty and when natural as this is cannot fail to please it will not however bear a comparison with the wild scenes of the forest we enter them again with pleasure and speak of them as we do of the works of a great literary genius which contain greater beauties tho perhaps blended with greater defects than the labored works of a less exalted tho more correct writer every thing in these cultered scenes may be perfectly correct  nothing may offend yet we seek in vain for those strokes of genius which rouse the imagination and are so frequently found among the wild scenes of the forest some things however at paultons did offend particularly an attempt to improve a little foreststream by forming a head into a river attempts of this kind seldom answer and the misfortune here is the more glaring as a great white chinese bridge stands every where in sight to remind us of it we wish for simple ornaments on all occasions  ornaments which the eye is not obliged to notice here the ornament was particularly out of place as it was not only a fault itself but led the eye to the detection of other faults  from paultons we entered an extensive tract of rising ground which bounds the forest on the north along the borders of wiltshire and stretches on the left toward fordingbridge the river avon and the county of dorset this side of the forest however is by much the narrowest it is limits hardly extend from east to west above four miles whereas the boundary of the forest in the same direction near the sea extends at least fourteen  this lofty plain consisting chiefly of furze and heath as far as we surveyed it appeared in itself little adorned with any forestfurniture the little wood in any part of it is area bore no proportion to it is extent but it overlooked very grand views in a picturesque light therefore we considered it as a vast theater from whence we might view almost all the regions of the forest which we had passed  toward the north indeed in some parts it commands views into wiltshire but the country is cultivated and not removed enough to lose it is formalities this part therefore may be considered only as a foil the grand opening is toward the south here we found a station which commanded a very noble view the heath making a gentle dip presents a vast bay which spreads the whole forest in a manner before the eye as far as the sea in one vast expanse of scenery bramblehill one of the lodges standing on a knoll on the left about half a mile below the eye occupies one side of the opening into this immense woody distance and another prominence on which stand the ruins of castlemalwood occupies the other the station may easily be found by this direction between these two promontories the eye is conducted from wood to wood over lawns and heaths through every shade of perspective till all distinction at length is lost and the eye doubts whether it is still roving over the tufted woods of the forest or is landed upon the distant shores of the isle of wight or is wandering among the hazy streaks of the horizon at least it had that dubious appearance when we saw it but it is one of the choice recommendations of these extensive scenes that they are subject to a thousand varieties from the different modifications of the atmosphere  a vast scene however like this is unmanageable as we have often observed tho it may be highly picturesque  but our observations on this subject may be carried farther than we have yet carried them  it is a common assertion among landscapepainters that if the picture be justly painted an extensive distance in miniature will have the same effect on the mind of the spectator as if it were painted on the largest scale stand near a window they tell you and the whole may be brought within the circumference of a pane of glass if then the same landscape were exactly painted on the pane of glass it would have the same effect in a picture which it has in nature  this reasoning i fear is false it depends entirely on the supposition that we collect all our notices of external objects from the eye agreeably to that construction of it which the anatomist gives us whereas in fact the eye is a mere window it is a pane of glass through which the imagination is impressed by the notices it receives of outward objects which notices tho sometimes true are often false particularly with regard to the size of objects and will mislead it unless corrected by experience the mathematician talks of the angle of vision and demonstrates that the size of the object in the eye must be in exact proportion to that part of the cone of rays which it intercepts and it is on this supposition the painter asserts that an extensive distance exactly painted tho in miniature will affect the spectator like the natural scene but many things are mathematically true tho experimently false such is the famous puzzle of achilles and the tortoise the mathematician demonstrates that the tortoise must win the race tho not one jockey at newmarket would bet on his side just so the imagination revolts from the mathematical account of vision if i examine for instance the height of that tree by the side of a notched stick it is scarce an inch but no mathematical proof can persuade me that i see it under those dimensions i am well assured that the tree not only is but appears to me much larger  if indeed my imagination could be so far deceived as to believe the landscape which is painted on a pane of glass were really the landscape transmitted through it i might then suppose it of the dimensions of nature on no other supposition i can give it credit but if a deceit of this kind could not easily be practiced on a pane of glass much less could it be practiced in a picture we could never so far impose upon ourselves as to conceive a little object of the dimensions of a foot by six inches hung against a wall can be a just representation of a country twenty or thirty miles in extent  i mean not to debate the structure of the eye with the philosopher all i mean to assert is that the picturesque eye has nothing to do with tunics irises et retinas it judges of nothing by a focus or a cone of vispual rays the imagination guided by experience presides solely over vision as far at least as the bulk of objects is concerned and it pictures them not as painted on a mathematical point but on an extended plain and of their natural size how nature manages this matter is beyond the painters power to explain the fact is certain let the philosopher if he can account for it  to bring the argument to the point before us there must be real space to interest the imagination and excite ideas of grandeur in a picture the imagination cannot be imposed upon two or three inches may give us the form of the landscape the proportion between the foreground and the offskip the hue of distance and it is general appearance and we may be pleased with these things even in miniature but it is impossible within such scanty limits to raise any of those feelings which landscape in it is full dimensions will excite try the matter experimentally examine such a landscape as this vast extended forestview before us alternately first with the naked eye and then with a diminishing glass which at least gives as just a representation of the perspective and keeping of nature as any artificial landscape can do and you will be convinced how much the idea loses under the latter experiment at the same time if such a distance as this extensive as it is were painted on a larger scale than common and properly accompanied and balanced with foreground we might be tempted to forget it is undersize and seeing so large a picture might acknowledge something like an equality with nature we might be inclined to forget the deception and might in some degree feel those sublime ideas which nature itself excites  besides this grand and extensive distance which we surveyed between bramblehill and the ruins of castlemalwood we found many views of the same kind as we traversed the high and heathy grounds toward fritham and fordingbridge but the hills about boldrewood and lyndhurst occupy the middle space between the northern and southern parts of the forest and as they rise considerably and intercept our views the more we proceed in a western direction i know not whether on the whole the view we have just taken is not one of the most extensive and most amusing which the whole forest exhibits  i cannot therefore conclude a description of newforest more properly than with this grand exhibition which in a manner comprehends the whole  as i have more than once however observed that scenes of all kinds and distances the most of all are so diversified by the circumstances under which they are examined that no single view can give an adequate idea of them i wish before i shut up these forestscenes to add a fuller illustration of this great picturesque truth which should always be in the recollection of every picturesque observer of nature the example i shall select for this purpose shall be the scenery around the parsonagehouse at vicarshills not so much because it is a pleasing scene in itself as because lying constantly before my eye it is the best instance i can have for no one can make remarks of this kind on a scene which he has not frequently examined  i must first describe the scenery before i remark the several circumstances under which it is often varied  vicarshill is a knoll falling gently on the east to a grand woody bank part of the wild grounds of sir harry burrard  on the south toward the channel and the isle of wight  and on the west toward lymingtonriver  all which it overlooks as it stands on the edge of the forest the situation of it is nearly conformable to the wish of the poet  be my retreat between the groaning forest and the shore a rural sheltered solitary scene thompsons winter  the two last of these epithets indeed belong not to it it stands rather lofty tho not high and is so far from being solitary that it enjoys a good neighborhood  from this knoll the views are engrossed by two houses mr cleavlands and the vicarage the united plantations of which exclude the prospect from all other parts of the hill from both these houses the views are beautiful but they are of different kinds mr cleavlands standing on the west side of the knoll has a view of lymingtonriver which forms one of it is best sweeps below his lawn from hence the eye is carried along the river to it is opening into the channel of which  together with the shores around  the island beyond  and the town of lymington  the distant landscape is formed these distances are varied as you view them from the upper and lower parts of the lawn and in general as they are circumscribed by the high lands which bound the estuary they are much more picturesque and in the eye of a painter more beautiful than those vast extensive views of the island and channel which we have so often seen from various parts of the coast we have had other occasions to remark the picturesque beauty of this estuary see page    and      as mr cleavlands has a better view of the water the vicarage has a better view of the woods a house built where it could command both scenes would enjoy a grand situation the view however is so good that it will bear a division and yet each part form a whole the vicarage stands in the garden closed on every side but the south which is the aspect of the best rooms before it is spread a small lawn proportioned to it is size at the end of the lawn which is also the boundary of the forest is a sunkfence connecting it with the meadows beyond these meadows declining to the south and east form the brow of vicarshill in those directions and are screened by the grand woody bank abovementioned wheeling gently round which shapes the lower part of them into a sort of semicircular valley to the hanging woods of this very picturesque bank a close descending walk from the house following the direction of the forestboundary unites the garden  the woody bank which is the grand circumstance of the view having thus circled the meadows falls away toward the estuary of the river and becomes one of it is high enclosures on the other side it is intersected by a rising ground on which stands the town of lymington at the distance of a mile see the situation of lymington described page     over the dip formed by this intersection rises as if fitted for the place a lofty part of the isle of wight from which a ridge of high land continues passing over the town as a background below the island appears a small catch of the channel but the intervening woods of the eastern screen have now almost intercepted it interposing one beautiful circumstance in the room of another  some of the chief modes of incidental beauty which vary these few parts of landscape are these  in a morning the effect is often beautiful when the sun rising over the trees of the eastern bank pours his sloping rays upon their tufted heads while all the bottom of the valley not yet having caught the splendour is dusky and obscure see an effect of this kind described more at length vol i p       the effect still continues beautiful as the sun rises higher some prominent part of the woody screen always catches the light while the recesses among the trees still hold the depth of the morningshadow  the disposition of the landscape is as well adapted to receive the effects of an evening as of a morningsun as all the eastern screen is richly and picturesquely wooded the illumination of the trees from the west is generally pleasing especially as the meadows descending to the east and south and of course declining from the summersun present large masses of shade  but the effect of light is best seen in an eveningstorm when it rises from the east behind the woody bank while the sun sinking in the west throws a splendour upon the trees which seen to such advantage against the darkness of the hemisphere shows the full effect of light and shade  in winter the island is generally of an indistinct gray hue but in summer when the eveningsun gets more to the north it is declining ray strikes the distant cliffs and broken grounds of the islandshores and gives them a great resplendency as these broken grounds run behind the town the effect of the chimnies and houses when seen in shadow against the warm tints of the islandshores is often very picturesque much more so than when the sun throws it is light upon them and here we see exemplified a truth in landscape that the light breaks a town into parts  shows it is poverty  and dissipates it is effect whereas all the parts of a town seen in shadow are blended together and it becomes one grand object i speak however chiefly of towns in the situation of this placed along the ridge of an eminence and about a mile from the eye in remote distance a ray of light thrown upon a town has often a good effect  these splendid lights of an eveningsun upon the cliffs and broken shores of the island appear first about the beginning of april but they grow stronger as the power of the sun increases various other tints also of a bluish purplish and yellowish hue the effects of eveningsuns in summer occasionally invest the island  but haziness and mists are here as in other places the great sources of variety in general they have a good effect but sometimes a bad one as the remote part of the landscape which consists of the isle of wight does not immediately connect with the woods on one side and the town of lymington on the other but is separated from them by the channel which is about two or three leagues across it of course happens that when a partial fog removes the island alone from the fight a violent chasm is left in the landscape there is no gradation the rising ground on which lymington stands appears staring against a foggy sky without any support of distance nothing can show more strongly the use of distances in completing the harmony of a view when the several parts of a country melt into each other as in the grand distance we have just been surveying from castlemalwood a fog or mist can never introduce any great mischief it comes gradually on and therefore only gradually obscures it is the chasm which occasions the blank at the same time notwithstanding the island is not gradually connected with the other parts of the country the landscape loses in no other modification of the atmosphere if the mist be more general so as to obscure not only the island but the town also and in proportion the nearer parts of the view the effect is often beautiful the woods of the eastern bank being obscured the firs of the lawn standing much nearer rise strongly in opposition the eye is pleased with the contrast while the imagination is pleased also with diving into the obscurity and forming it is own objects  the line also which the high grounds of the island form upon the sky is sometimes strong and sometimes faint sometimes also a part of it is broken or intercepted by clouds which gives a contrast to the other part  again the mist is sometimes so light that it removes the island several leagues farther from the eye yet still the landscape partaking of the general effect preserves it is harmony  sometimes also after a heavy shower when the air as the rain goes off becomes perfectly diaphanous like an italian sky and all the the vapors are precipitated the island will advance many leagues nearer the eye every part of it will be perfectly conspicuous even the little divisions of property will appear faintly sketched upon it yet still the clearness of the other parts of the landscape according with it all will be in place and a general harmony preserved  these are chiefly summereffects i have often however seen beautiful effects in winter of a similar kind especially in a morning somewhat inclining to frost when the rays of the sun have appeared as it were struggling between the haziness of the island the smoke of the town and the splendour of the rising sun in one part distinctness has prevailed in another obscurity  i have seen also something of the same effect in a winternoon only rendered perhaps still more beautiful by streaks of ruddy sunset passing along the horizon and joining in the conflict  in the year      when such uncommon fogs prevailed over europe the appearances of the island were often very strange earth clouds and water confounded together in vast combinations seemed often to have exchanged places the water would appear above the island and the clouds below both but these appearances were so uncommon that they scarce deserve mention nor indeed were they often in themselves picturesque  i omit mentioning here the variety which the seasons produce on this landscape tho as it is a woody scene the effect is often singularly beautiful especially in autumn  if then so great a variety of incidents arise from the few circumstances of landscape which are found at this place with what variety may we suppose landscapes of a larger size and composed of more complicated parts may be attended particularly extensive distances which are of all others attended with the greatest variety of incidental beauty every landscape indeed has something peculiar to itself which disposes it more or less to receive the incidents of light and weather in some peculiar manner an open seacoast one should think of so simple a construction as to be little liable to receive any change and yet i have stood upon a seacoast on a sunshiny cloudy day when the wind has been rather brisk and have in less than an hour seen the whole picture under a dozen different forms from the varying of the lights in the sky on the horizon on the surface of the water or on some part of the coast  the conclusions from all these remarks are that every landscape is in itself a scene of great variety  that there are few landscapes which have not at some time or other their happy moments  that a landscape of extent and beauty will take the full period of a year to show itself in all the forms it is capable of receiving  and that he who does not attend to the variations of the atmosphere loses half the beauty of his views  sect xi of the animals which frequent the forest having thus taken a view of the most beautiful scenes of the forest it is lastly proper to people them no landscape is complete without it is figures i shall make a few observations therefore on such animals as frequent the forest which the imagination of the reader may scatter about as he pleases in the several scenes which have been presented to him the human inhabitants of the forest have already been mentioned see p  0   a diminutive breed of horses run wild in newforest in general however the horse is private property tho sometimes with difficulty ascertained numbers of people who have lands in the neighborhood of the forest have a right of commoning in it and most of the cottagers who border on it assume that right many of them have two or three mares and some who make it their business to breed colts have droves  the horse is gregarious herds of twenty or thirty are often seen feeding together in summer especially when they have plenty of pasturage and can live as they please in winter they are obliged to separate and seek their food as they can find it in general indeed they are left in all seasons to take their chance in the forest where there is no expense there can be no great loss and what is saved is so much gained in marshy parts a severe winter often goes hardly with them but in dry grounds where heath and furze abound they pick up a tolerable wintersubsistence especially if they have learned the little arts of living which necessity teaches of these arts one of the most useful is to bruise and pound with their forefeet the prickly tops of furze this operation which i have often seen performed prepares the rigid diet of a furzebush in some degree for mastication and renders it rather less offensive to the palate  when such colts as have long run wild are to be caught for sale their ideas of liberty are so unconfined from pasturing in so wild a range that it is matter of no little difficulty to take them sometimes they are caught by slight of hand with a rope and a noose but if this method fail they are commonly hunted down by horsemen who relieve each other colthunting is a common practice in the forest  the colts which feed on obergreen are sometimes taken by the following stratagem in this part runs a long bog described under the name of longfladebottom which is crossed by a mole thrown over it see p      with this passage the colt is well acquainted and on being pursued is easily driven toward it when he is about the middle of the mole two or three men start up in front and oblige him to leap into the bog where he is entangled and seized  at all the neighboring fairs these horses are a principal commodity and are bought up for every purpose to which a horse can be applied diminutive as they are you may often see half a dozen of them straining in a wagon and as it is fashionable to drive them in light carriages their price has been inhanced it is a little fortune to a poor cottager if he happen to possess three or four colts that are tolerably handsome and match well he may probably sell them for ten or twelve pounds a piece  in point of value the newforest horse would rise higher if the same care were taken in breeding him which was formerly taken see manwood on forestlaw page     and which is still in some degree taken in the neighboring forest of bear where i have heard the keepers are ordered to destroy all horses which at three years of age are under thirteen hands and all mates under twelve  there is another evil likewise which tends to injure the forestcolt and that is putting him to business at too early an age tho a small horse attains maturity earlier than a large one yet these horses bred chiefly by indigent people and generally of little value are introduced much sooner to labor than abler and better horses commonly are  the fame and exploits are still remembered of a little beautiful gray horse which had been suffered to run wild in the forest till he was eight years of age when he had attained his full strength his first sensations on the loss of his liberty were like those of a wildbeast he flew at his keeper with his open mouth or rearing on his hindlegs darted his forefeet at him with the most malicious fury he fell however into hands that tamed him he became by degrees patient of the bit and at length suffered a rider from this time his life was a scene of glory he was well known on every road in the county was the favorite of every groom and the constant theme of every ostler but in the chase his prowess was most shown there he carried his master with so much swiftness ease and firmness that he always attracted the eyes of the company more than the game they pursued  the newforest horse is often supposed to be of spanish extraction from ancestors imagined to have been shipwrecked on the coast of hampshire in the time of the armada but i look on this as a species of the ancient vaunt genus a jove summo and to deserve as little attention some of them have a form which would not disgrace so noble a lineage the gray horse represented in the annexed plate is among the most beautiful but in general the croup of the foresthorse is low and his head illset on having what the jockies call a stiff jaw of this defect a resemblance is given in the horse on the left whose head is set on as those of the foresthorses commonly are their claim therefore to high lineage must in general rest more on their good qualities than on their beauty  on the hardiness of their nature  on their uncommon strength  on their agility and sureness of foot which they probably acquire by constantly lifting their legs among furze  but tho the form of the newforest horse is seldom beautiful yet as the ornament of a forest scene he is very picturesque the horse in his natural state rough with all his mane about him and his tail waving in the wind as he feeds is always beautiful but particularly in so wild a scene as this which he graces exceedingly  on this subject i cannot forbear digressing a little and i hope the critical reader will not be too fastidious on the great indignity the horse suffers from the mutilation of his tail and ears within this century i believe the barbarous custom of docking horses came in use and has passed through various modifications like all other customs which are not founded in nature and truth a few years ago the short dock was the only tail if it may be called such in fashion both in the army and in carriages the absurdity however of this total amputation began to appear the gentlemen of the army led the way they acknowledged the beauty and use of the tail as nature made it the short dock every where disappeared and all dragoonhorses paraded with long tails  the nagtail however still continued in use of this there are several species all more or less mutilated the most deformed one is nickedtail so named from a cruel operation used in forming it the under sinews of the dock being divided the tail starts upwards directly contrary to the position which nature intended the nagtail is still seen in all genteel carriages nor will any person of fashion ride a horse without one even the gentlemen of the army who have shown the most sense in the affair of horsetails have been so misled as to introduce the nagtail into the light horse tho it would be as difficult to give a reason now for the nagtail as formerly for the shortdock  two things are urged in defense of this cruel mutilation  the utility and the beauty of it let us briefly as possible examine both  to make an animal useful is no doubt the first consideration and to make a horse so we must necessarily make him suffer some the  tail  the short dock  the stretch tail  the square tail  things which are unnatural because we take him out of a state of nature he must be fed with hay and corn in the winter which he cannot get in his open pastures for if he have exercise beyond nature he must have such food as will enable him to bear it as it is necessary likewise to make our roads hard and durable it is necessary also to give the horse an iron hoof that he may travel over them without injuring his feet  but all this has nothing to do with his tail from which no encumbrance arises  yes says the advocate for docking as it is necessary for the horse to travel to hunt and to race it is useful to lighten him of of every encumbrance and as it is necessary for him to travel through dirty roads it is useful to rid him of an instrument which is continually collecting dirt and lashing it over himself and his rider  to ease your horse of every encumbrance in traveling is certainly right you should see that his bridle and saddle which are his great encumbrances are as easy as possible and that the weight he carries or draws be proportioned to his strength but depend upon it he receives no encumbrance from nature it is a maxim among all true philosophers that nature has given nothing in vain and there can be no reasonable doubt but that nature has given the horse his tail to balance and assist his motions that this is the case seems plain from the use he makes of it when the animal is at rest his tail is pendent but when he is in violent action he raises and spreads it as a bird does in the same situation would the swallow or the dove be assisted in their flight by the loss of their tails or the greyhound in his speed by docking him for myself i have no doubt but if the experiment were tried at newmarket which i suppose it never was the horse with his long tail however the literati there might laugh at him would not be in the least injured in his speed and would certainly answer better in all his sudden turns to the intention of his rider he would extend and spread his helm it would steer his way and we should seldom hear of his running out of his course or on the wrong side of the post  besides his tail probably assists him even in his common exertions and balances his body when he trots and prevents his stumbling i have heard a gentleman who had traveled much in the east remark that the turkish and arabian horses rarely stumble which he attributed and with much appearance of truth to their long tails  but whatever use the tail may be to the norse in action it is acknowledged on all hands to be of infinite use to him at rest whoever sees the horse grazing in summer and observes the constant use he makes of his long tail in lashing the flies from his sides must be persuaded that it is a most useful instrument and must be hurt to see him fidget a short dock back and forward with ineffectual attempts to rid himself of some plague which he cannot reach  as to the objection against the tail as an instrument which is continually gathering dirt and lashing it around if there be any truth in what i have already observed this little objection dissolves itself especially as the inconvenience may with great ease be remedied when the road is dirty either by knotting up the tail or by tying it with a leathernstrap  but whatever becomes of utility the horse is certainly more beautiful we are told without his dangling tail what a handsome figure he makes when he carries both his ends well this is the constant language of horsedealers stablekeepers and grooms and such language tho originating in tastless ignorance and mere prejudice has drawn over men of sense and understanding  it is inconceiveable how delusively the eye sees as well as the understanding when it is fascinated and led aside by fashion and custom associated ideas of various kinds give truth a different air when we see a gamecock with all his sprightly actions and gorgeous plumes about him we acknowledge one of the most beautiful birds in nature but when we see him armed with steel and prepared for battle we cry what a scarecrow but a cockfighter with all the ideas of the pit about him will conceive that in this latter state he is in his greatest beauty and if his picture be drawn it must be drawn in this ridiculous manner i have often seen it  let jockies and stableboys and cockfighters keep their own absurd ideas but let not men who pretend to see and think for themselves adopt such ridiculous conceits  in arts we judge by the rules of art in nature we have no criterion but the forms of nature we criticize a building by the rules of architecture but in judging of a tree or a mountain we judge by the most beautiful forms of each which nature has given us it is thus in other things from nature alone we have the form of a horse should we then seek for beauty in that object in our own wild conceptions or recur to the great original from whence we had it we may be assured that natures forms are always the most beautiful and therefore we should endeavor to correct our ideas by hers  if however we cannot give up the point let us at least be consistent if we admire a horse without a tail or a cock without feathers let us not laugh at the chinese for admiring the disproportioned foot of his mistress nor at the indian for doting on her black teeth and tattooed cheeks for myself i cannot conceive why it should make a horse more beautiful to take his tail from him than it would make a man to clap a tail to him see lord monboddo on that subject   with regard indeed to the natural beauty of a horses tail we want little reasoning on the subject in conjunction with his mane it gives him dignity  it hides his stradling buttocks which is a decency in nature we should admire rather than destroy  it forms a contrast among the legs the four equal legs of every animal are it is greatest deformity and their sameness of course gives the painter the most trouble in the management of them in many of her forms indeed where nature does not seem to aim at beauty she neglects this economy but as if she meant the horse for one of her most elegant productions she has provided for him in this respect also by giving him a graceful flow of hair which hiding sometimes one leg and sometimes another introduces a pleasing contrast among them all  the accidental motion also of the tail gives it peculiar beauty both when the horse moves it himself and when it waves in the wind the beauty of it indeed to an unprejudiced eye is conspicuous at once and in all parade and statehorses it is acknowledged tho even here there is an attempt made to improve nature by art the hair must be adorned with ribbons and the bottom of the tail clipped square which adds heaviness and is certainly so far a deformity  the captain of an english man of war gave me an account sometime ago of his landing in one of the piratical states of barbary while his ship anchored in the bay he was received by the dey i think of tripoli with great civility and among other things saw his stables they were lined with a very long double row of the most beautiful barb and arabian horses he was struck with their beauty to which their grand flowing tails combed and oiled in the nicest manner were no little addition as he continued his walk through the stud he came to a couple of horses with nagtails on inquiring into their history he found they were english horses which had been presented to the dey the horses themselves were fit to appear any where but the contrast of their tails he thought in such company made so very strange and disgraceful an appearance that he was ashamed of his countrymen the case was his eye having been thus accustomed to the beautiful forms of nature had gotten rid of it is prejudices and being a rational man saw the matter in it is proper light  i shall conclude my remarks on this cruel mutilation with an epigram by voltaire  that celebrated wit was in england about the time when the babarous custom of docking horses was in high fashion he was so shocked at it that he wrote the following verses which it is said he gave to lord lyttelton  vous fires anglois et barbares que vous etes coupent les tates a vos rois et les queues a vos betes mais les franccois plus polis et aimant les loix laissent les queues a leurs betes et les tates a leurs rois there is more indignation than wit i think in these verses voltaire seems to consider docking a horse and killing a king as equal crimes which however is carrying the matter somewhat farther than the picturesque eye wishes to carry it  the same absurd notions which have led men to cut off the tails of horses have led them also to cut off their ears i speak not of low grooms and jockies we have lately seen the studs of men of the first fashion misled probably by grooms and jockies producing only cropthorses  when a fine horse has wide lopping ears as he sometimes has without spring or motion in them a man may be tempted to remove the deformity but to cut a pair of fine ears out of the head of a horse is if possible a still greater absurdity than to cut off his tail nothing can be alleged in it is defense the ear neither retards motion nor flings dirt  much of the same ground may be gone over on this subject which we went over on the last with regard to the utility of the ear it is not improbable that cropping it may injure the horses hearing there is certainly less concave surface to receive the vibrations of the air  i have heard it also asserted with great confidence that this mutilation injures his health for when a horse has lost that penthouse which nature has given him over his ear it is reasonable to believe the wind and rain may get in and give him cold  but if these injuries are not easily proved the injury he receives in point of beauty may strenuously be insisted on few of the minuter parts of animal nature are more beautiful than the ear of a horse when it is neatly formed and well set on  the contrast of the lines is pleasing the concavity and the convexity being generally seen together in the natural turn of the ear  nor is the proportion of the ear less pleasing it is contracted at the insertion swells in the middle and tapers to a point the ear of no animal is so beautifully proportioned that of some beasts especially of the savage kinds as the lion and pard is naturally rounded and has little form the ears of other animals as the fox and cat are pointed short and thick those of the cow are round and heavy the hares and asss ears are long and nearly of the same thickness the dog and swine have flapping ears the sheep alone has ears that can compare with the horse  the ear of the horse receives great beauty also from it is color as well as form the ears of bay and gray horses are generally tipped with black which melts into the color of the head  but the ear of the horse receives it is greatest beauty from motion the ear of no animal has that anger or intended mischief  fear  a crupthoror  under no impression of passion  vibrating power the ears of a spirited horse are continually in motion quivering and darting their sharp points toward every object that presents and the action is still more beautiful when the ears are so well set on that the points are drawn nearly together virgil who was among the most accurate observers of nature takes notice of this quivering motion in the ears of a horse   si qua sonum procul arma dedere stare loco nescit micat auribus  the same word which he uses here to express the motion of a horses ears he uses elsewhere to express the gleaming of arms the glittering of a gem and the vibrating motion of a serpents tongue  but it is not only the quivering motion of the horses ears that we admire we admire them also as the interpreters of his passions particularly of fear which some denominate courage and of anger or malice the former he expresses by darting them forward the latter by laying them back  this digression has carried me much farther than i intended but the mutilation of the tail and ears of this noble animal is so offensive to reason and common sense that i have been imperceptibly led on by my indignation tho nothing i can say on the subject i am well persuaded can weigh against the authority of grooms and jockies so as to make a general reform yet if here and there a small party could be raised in opposition to this strange custom it might in time perhaps obtain fashion on it is side  we commonly suppose that when mankind in general agree in a point there is truth i believe no nation upon earth except the english have the custom among them of docking nicking and cropping their horses  the wisdom too of all antiquity decides fully against the practice instances perhaps might be found in the basreliefs of the antonine column and other remains of roman antiquity both of the cropped ear and of the hoggedmane which i take for granted were never practiced except in cases of defect but i am persuaded no one instance can be found in all the remains of grecian or roman antiquity of a short dock or a nagtail  besides the horse the forest is much frequented by another animal of his genus inferior indeed in dignity but superior in picturesque beauty i mean the ass among all the tribes of animals scarce one is more ornamental in landscape in what this picturesque beauty consists whether in his peculiar character  in his strong lines  in his coloring  in the roughness of his coat  or in the mixture of all  would be difficult perhaps to ascertain the observation however is undoudtedly true and every picturesque eye will acknowledge it berghem bears full testimony to it is truth in his pictures the ass makes often the most distinguished figure and a late excellent landscapepainter mr gainsborough  i have heard generally kept this animal by him that he might have it always at hand to introduce in various attitudes into his pictures i have heard also that a plaistercast of an ass modelled by him is sold in the shops in london but i never saw it  one reason indeed for replenishing the forest so much with asses is the propagation of mules of which great numbers are bred in many parts of it at least the breed was much encouraged before the troubles of america whither several were every year exported  the mule is by no means so picturesque an animal as the ass and is rarely introduced in landscape chiefly i suppose because he has not so determined a character he is neither a horse nor an ass and yet has a resemblance to both to make an object truly picturesque it should be marked strongly with some peculiar character  besides the mule varies in form as much from himself as he does either from the horse or the ass he follows his sire a mule bred from an arabian differs as much from the offspring of a forester as the two sires themselves this also injures his picturesque character  the mule from which the annexed drawing was taken was a mule of blood the ass also varies from itself but not so much as the mule it is here represented under one of it is most elegant forms that it may the more justly be compared with a mule of the same description    with horned cattle of course the forest like all other large wastes abounds and this is a source of great picturesque beauty  the enclosure presents only a small number at once the property of some single person but in the forest the cattle of all the neighboring hamlets and cottages pasture together we see them often in large herds and in summer the season of landscape they are drawn in numbers to favorite spots particularly about pools and rivulets where the various combinations and attitudes they form are beautiful and picturesque in the highest degree  besides they appear in a forest to much more advantage than they can possibly do within the formality of hedges  but of all animals with which the forest abounds the stag is in a peculiar manner adapted to it is scenes the wildness of his nature harmonizes with them and the beauty of his form adorns them  we admire his erect front his spreading horns on which he sometimes wears above twenty antlers his limbs finished with so much elegance and his stately measured pace  but here perhaps the advocate for docking horses will glory in the short tail of the stag he has no reason there is no doubt nature has provided for the exigences of the stag in his speed as well as for those of the horse it is true the shortness of the tail in so beautiful an animal rather seems a defect but as in the language of religion the wellordered mind acknowledges every thing right in the works of god  so in the language of painting the picturesque eye acknowledges every thing beautiful in the works of nature some objects indeed may please less than others and be less accommodated to the rules of painting but all objects are best as nature made them art cannot mend them where art interferes beauty vanishes we dress the polished lawn but we only remove what may there be a deformity tho elsewhere a beauty when we endeavor to improve the object  when we clip the holly and trim the box we introduce deformity we sometimes indeed artfully remove a branch but it is to open the landscape not to improve the tree  the stag during his first year is called a calf and does not assume the name of a stag till his fifth being known in the intermediate years by certain tecknical names which none but foresters can remember in his sixth year he takes the respectable title of a heart some authors have given it to his fifth but i follow the authority of manwood see manwood page      besides this title he may still attain two higher degrees of honor those of a hartroyal and of a hartroyal proclaimed  if he be hunted by the king and escape or have his life given him for the sport he has afforded he becomes from thence forward a hartroyal  if he be hunted out of the forest and there escape the king has sometimes honored him with a royal proclamation the purport of which is to forbid any one to molest him that he may have free liberty of returning to his forest from that time he becomes a hartroyal proclaimed  manwood mentions a fact of this kind which he found on record in the castle of nottingham it is dated in the time of richard the first who having roused a heart in sherwoodforest pursued him as far as barnsdale in yorkshire where the heart foiled and escaped his hounds the king in gratitude for the diversion he had received ordered him immediately to be proclaimed at tickill and at all the neighboring towns  an affair of this kind it is not unlikely was the original of whitehartsilver as it is called in the forest of blackmore in dorsetshire some gentlemen in the time of henry iii having destroyed a white heart which had given the king much diversion and which it is probable had been proclaimed the king laid a heavy fine on their lands an acknowledgment of which was paid into the exchequer so late as in the reign of elizabeth see camdens brit p     hutchings in his history of dorsetshire says it is paid to this day vol ii p         instances of favorite stags and of the warmth with which mankind have espoused their cause when injured occur so frequently that virgil thought a circumstance of this kind a proper incident for the whole plot of his aeneid to turn on  quae prima malorum causa fuit belloque animos accendit agrestes cervus erat forma praestanti aen vii        in general the stag is a harmless inoffensive animal at one season only when he is engaged in his seraglio he is fierce you hear him roaring and bellowing at that time about the forest meditating revenge on his rival whom he meets head to head and foot to foot while he is able with his antlers to parry the attack he stands his ground and if he happen to be of equal prowess with his rival the conflict is obstinate but a weak adversary soon feels the strength of his opponent he cannot resist his push his flanks give way and he is presently driven off the field  at these seasons of riot the stag is said to be dangerous if therefore in passing through the forest you see him at a distance in your path you had better avoid him by turning a little to the right or left if you do not approach he will not pursue i have heard old foresters however say they did not remember an instance of his ever doing voluntary mischief at any time and assert that he will always avoid the passenger if he can  but it is on all hands agreed that he is highly dangerous when hard pressed by the hounds and driven to extremity when the chase is well nigh over  when that elastic vigor with which at first he bounded along the plain is changed into a heavy gallop  when his mouth becomes black and dry  his tongue hanging from it  and his eye marked with horror and dismay cruel surely to turn such agony into sport his reverence for man is gone he is driven to despair and all his powers are collected into terror and undistinguishing fury  some years ago a stag in newforest pressed by the hunters and just entering a thicket was opposed by a peasant who foolishly with his arms extended attempted to turn him the stag held his course and darting one of his antlers into the man carried him off some paces sticking upon his horn the man was immediately conveyed to lymington where he lay dangerously ill for some time but at length recovered i have heard also that when the duke of bedford was lordwarden of the forest his huntsman had a horse killed under him by a stag which he crossed in the same imprudent manner  we have a beautiful description in shakespeare which i cannot forbear introducing both for the sake of the picture and for the knowledge it conveys the sorrows of the dying stag  his sighs his tears and the unfriendly return his distresses find from all his former companions are circumstances in his history wellknown to the naturalist the forester and the huntsman the melancholy jaques is introduced by the poet reposing on the ground   as he lay beneath an oak whose antique root projects above the brook that brawls along the wood to the same place a poor sequestered stag that from the hunters aim had taken a hurt did come to languish  the wretched animal heaved forth such groans that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat almost to bursting and the big round drops coursed one another down his patient face  anon a careless herd full of rich pasture bounding comes along and never stays to greet him aye quoth jaques sweep on ye fat and greasy citizens it is just the fashion wherefore look ye not upon that poor and broken bankrupt there the hind also in defense of her calf is equally formidable as far as her strength allows and her powers of exerting it she has been known to strike a dog so violently with the spring of her forefeet as to strip his skin from his flesh and lay his side bare  as it is now many years since newforest has been a scene of royaldiversion the breed of stags is generally diminished it is a rare thing now to meet them in the southern parts of it tho within the memory of man they were so numerous that i have heard an old forester pointing to the side of a hill on beaulieu heath say he had seen them lying there in herds like cows and horses there are still however many in the northern parts of the forest particularly about boldrewood and burleylodges but in general the fallow deer are more encouraged    the stag might easily be trained like the reindeer of lapland to draw a carriage if we had not animals more proper for the purpose the present earl of orford i have been informed bred two by way of experiment which by domestication became manageable were bitted and drew a light curricle with great gentleness and expedition  the stag is a native of our island as indeed he is found in most parts of the world differing only in a few accidental varieties  the fallowdeer is much more limited by nature in the place of his abode and in this island particularly has been received only by importation he is supposed to have but two varieties the spotted and the darkbrown the former is of indian extraction see pennants zool  the latter was brought from denmark by james i they are now indeed much intermixed but in general the spotted race are more the inhabitants of the park the brown which is the hardier species occupy the forest the latter is the more picturesque animal the uniform spot of the variegated deer is not so pleasing as one simple browntint melting away by degrees into a softer hue which produces a sort of natural light and shade as indeed all colors do which blend gently into each other  forestdeer tho pasturing at large seldom stray far from the walk where they are bred and the keeper who is studious that his deer may not travel into the limits of their neighbors incourages their fondness for home by feeding them in winter with holly and other plants which they love and browzing them in summer with the spray of ash when he distributes his dole he commonly makes a hollowing noise to call his dispersed family together in calm summerevenings if you frequent any part of the forest near a lodge you will hear this hollowing noise resounding through the woods and if you are not apprised of it you will be apt to wonder each evening at it is periodical exactness  deer feed generally in the night or at early dawn and retire in the day to the shelter of the woods their morning retreat is thus picturesquely described   the day pours in apace and opens all the lawny prospect wide the hazy woods the mountains misty top swell on the fight while over the forestglade the wild deer trip and often turning gaze at early passengers  mr pennant tell us see brit zool  that in germany the peasants frequently watch their corn the whole night to preserve it from the depredations of deer he needed not on this head to have carried so far from home the borderers of newforest are equally subject to the depredations of these animals and are often obliged when the neighboring deer have gotten a haunt of their cornlands to burn fires all night to deter them i heard a farmer say that it cost him five pounds one summer to guard eight acres of wheat it is a remark among foresters that all the deerkind are particularly offended by disagreeable smells the farmer commonly therefore smears the ropes with tar which he sets up as fences and throws fetid substances into his nightly fires to disseminate the odor in the smoke  we need not wonder if such depredations provoke acts of violence tho protected by law these atrocious marauders very often and deservedly suffer death for their offenses  a farmer however not long ago paid dear for taking the administration of justice into his own hands on an occasion of this kind he had frequently lamented the depredations on his corn and being at all events determined to retaliate he narrowly observed his fields and having found the track along which the nightly plunderer advanced he took his station near it as evening drew on with a rifled barrel well laden  after much listening and many little alarms he at last heard the bushes crackling and giving way in earnest he now made himself sure of his prey and lying close he levelled his piece so as just to take the stag as he emerged from the thicket the night was dark but however allowed him sufficient light to take aim at so large a body he fired with effect and had the pleasure to see his enemy fall but on running to him he was struck with finding he had killed one of the best horses of his own team  the sheep does not frequent the forest in any abundance here and there you find a little flock on a dry gravelly hill but in general the forest abounds with swamps and marshy bottoms highly pernicious to the sheep  the only animal perhaps except one which pursues with the greatest avidity what is most destructive to it it is the less however to be lamented that the lawns of the forest are not decorated with these animals as they are certainly less adapted to a forestscene than deer tho in themselves perhaps more picturesque the forest is wild and they are domestic  with hares and rabbits the forest abounds the latter are the underkeepers perquisite and of course well looked after there are many dry sandy knolls where colonies of these inmates are settled which are not among the least amusing of the minute inhabitants of the forest  in the same class we rank the squirrel he is not of consequence to be numbered among the picturesque ornaments of a scene but his form and manners his activity and feats of dexterity are very amusing on extraordinary occasions when he is agitated by love or anger his muscles acquire tenfold elasticity he descends a tree in a rapid spiral as quick as thought  darts up another in an opposite direction  flings himself from tree to tree with amazing exactness  and pursues his mate or his rival among the mazy branches of an oak with a velocity that eludes the sight  pheasants also greatly abound in many parts of the forest in the manors of beaulieu fawley and other places where they are protected they multiply beyond belief they are seen often in flocks feeding like poultry in the fields and adorning the woods and copses with their elegant shape and glossy plumage  the partridge is not so fond of the wild scenes of the forest as the pheasant she is more the bird of cultivation where the plough flourishes she thrives and seldom chooses to inhabit a country in a state of nature the pheasant has no objection to a field of corn but he can procure his living without it he can make a hearty meal of the wild berries of the woods or content himself with a bellyfull of acorns to him therefore corn is a luxury to the partridge it is a necessary she is generally found gleaning the stubble or basking under a hedge and gets into many a difficulty which she might have avoided by feeding more at large sometimes indeed she is found in the forest but it is chiefly when she is hunted by men and dogs from her favorite haunts  the blackcock on the other hand is more a forester than even the pheasant he has no connection with man he scorns the enclosure and all the dainties of the stubble the wild forest is his only delight and there his pleasures lie more in it is open than in it is woody scenes this bird was formerly found in great abundance in newforest but he is now much scarcer tho he has the honor which no other bird can boast of being protected as royal game to this day when the chiefjusticeineyre grants his warrants to kill game in the forest he always excepts the blackcock together with red and fallowdeer  the plaintive ringdove also is a great admirer of the woody scenes of the forest many suppose her a solitary bird at least that she flies only with her mate confounding her habits perhaps with those of the turtledove which i believe is solitary but the ringdove is certainly gregarious i have often seen in the forest large flocks of this species together in the winter months so well the poet knew their nature by contrasting them with the woodcock while doves in flocks the leafless trees oershade the lonely woodcock haunts the watery glade   the woodcock indeed is sometimes seen in the forest but the rough lawns and heaths he finds there do not entirely suit his appetite he is curious in the choice of his haunts he must have some sweet woody glen watered by little ouzing mossy rills into which he may easily thrust his beak and these he cannot every where meet with in the forest  the snipe less delicate in her haunts is the frequent inhabitant of the wildest scenes any swamp or marshy spot will please her and of these she finds abundance in various parts of the forest  plover of different kinds are common also in it is heathy parts i have sometimes seen large flocks of the gray species and have stood admiring them as they incircled the air in their regular mode of flight they in some degree resemble waterfowl but they are not so determined in their course wheeling about and forming various evolutions which are very amusing sometimes they appear all scattered and seem in confusion till closing together as if by the word of command they get again into form  with regard to all the songsters of the grove the woody scenes of the forest are vocal with them the thrush the blackbird the linnet and the nightingale abound on every spray the nightingale above all delights in the wild scenes of the forest the blackbird and the thrush are often seen tripping over the embellished lawn or flirting from the neat trimmed hollyhedge but the nightingale rarely frequents these cultured spots to her they afford little pleasure her commonest haunts are those of nature  the brake the copse the rough hedge or the forest where she sings her melodious strains to woods and solitude and often  wastes her sweetness on the desert air only that her voice so varied clear and full is heard far and wide when the evening is still almost at hand tho in the distant wood  among the birds of harmony there are two which i shall find it difficult perhaps to establish in that class  the jay and the woodpecker their screams however discordant in themselves or when out of place accord admirably with the forest and produce that kind of local harmony which one of our old poets davenant ascribes to the sound of a drum it may be dissonant in one place tho musical in another  what sound is that whose concord makes a jar it is noise in peace tho harmony in war the drum whose doubtful music does delight the willing ear and the unwilling fright we take music however here according to a very good definition of it in the large and proper sense of the word  as the art of variously affecting the mind by the power of sounds gregorys comparative view   but besides the harmony arising from the agreement of these wild notes with the scenes of the forest there is another source of it in the sympathetic feelings of the mind these wild notes excite ideas of those pleasing forestscenes where we have commonly heard them  but i shall give my meaning in better words than my own  there is in souls a sympathy with sounds and as the mind is pitched the ear is pleased with melting airs or martial brisk or grave some chord in unison with what we hear is touched within us and the heart replies how soft the music of those villagebells falling at intervals upon the ear in cadence sweet now dying all away now pealing loud again and louder still clear and sonorous as the gale comes on with easy force it opens all the cells where memory slept wherever i have heard a kindred melody the scene recurs and with it all it is pleasures  cooper  but however discordant the notes of these birds may be to the fastidious ear their rich yet harmonious plumage must at least recommend them as highly ornamental to every scene which they frequent the woodpecker particularly is arrayed in the richest plumage of any bird we have except the kingfisher yet all his splendid tints are perfectly harmonious the jay also is beautifully tinted on his back and breast with a light purplish hue intermixed with gray and his wing is perhaps the most admirable piece of workmanship in the whole feathered creation  on the same ground with the jay and the woodpecker i should not scruple also to rank the kite  if his manners did not disturb the harmony of the woods as much as his voice supports it independent of his manners he is one of the most harmonious appendages of the forest where mr pennant makes him indigenous brit zool  he is too small for picturesque use but highly ornamental to the natural scene his motions are easy and beautiful in a great degree he does not flap his pinions like the rook or the magpie and labor through the air he sails along with steady wing as if he were lord of the element on which he rode  but what harmonize chiefly with the forest are his wild screams which strike notes in peculiar unison with those scenes over which he sails   kites that swim sublime in still repeated circles screaming loud have charms for me  sounds inharmonious in themselves and harsh yet heard in scenes where peace for ever reigns please highly for their sake  it is remarkable that we seldom see more than two of this species together the male and the female they seem to divide the forest into provinces each bird has his own and with more than princely caution avoids his neighbors it is his great employment to circle through the air as the poet describes him above in various evolutions over his own woody dominions where with keen eye and keener talons he still preserves the spirit of the old forestlaw  very often the eagle himself is found in the forest mountainous and rocky countries are his delight on the ledge of some steep prominent rock he builds his eyry and rears his royal progeny but when food becomes scarce in those desolate regions as it sometimes does he finds it convenient to make an excursion into the forest here he hunts the leveret and the fawn and screens his atrocious deeds in the closest woods wherever he is seen the watchful forester endeavors to keep him in sight till he bring him to the ground and yet i have heard of a pair of eagles which took possession of a part of the forest called kingswood where they eluded all the arts of the keeper and continued their annual depredations for several years some time ago an eagle was killed after three discharges near ashylodge and was extended like the imperial arms in the courtroom of the kingshouse at lyndhurst  of all the feathered inhabitants of the forest i should have thought it is scenes in all respects the best adapted to the rook here he might build his habitation and rear his young far from the prying eyes of men here also he might indulge his social temper without limits and enlarge his aerial town from wood to wood  but he has no such ideas i cannot learn that he ever thought of forming a settlement in the forest which is the more extraordinary as he is in fact a lover of it is scenes and rejoices in them at all times but in the breedingseason when one should imagine he stood most in need of their shelter at that time he seems sedulously to court the faithless habitations of men through what propensity or instinct of nature the naturalist is wholly at a loss to determine after his family is reared and he has carried off in safety such of his progeny as have escaped the arts of men and boys he retires every evening at a late hour during the autumn and winter months to the closest covers of the forest having spent the day in the open fields and enclosures in quest of food his late retreat to the forest is characteristic of the near approach of night  night thickens and the crow makes wing to the rooky wood  and again retiring from the downs where all day long they pick their scanty fare a blackening train of loitering rooks thick urge their weary flight and seek the shelter of the grove    but in his economy there is something singular tho the forest is his winterhabitation if i may call that his habitation which like other vagrants he uses only as a place to sleep in he generally every day visits his nursery keeping up the idea of a family which he begins to make provision for in earnest very early in the spring  among all the sounds of animal nature sew are more pleasing than the cawing of rooks the rook has but two or three notes and when he attempts a solo we cannot praise his song but when he performs in concert which is his chief delight these two or three notes tho rough in themselves being mixed and intermixed with the notes of a multitude have all their sharp edges worn off and become very harmonious especially when softened in the air where the band chiefly exhibits you have this music in perfection when the whole colony is roused by the discharge of a gun  the cawing of rooks however is a sound not so congenial to the forest as it is to the grove  among the winged inhabitants of the forest we should not forget the honeybee which every where covers the surface of it these wide demeisns are in many parts spread with heath which is one of the favorite vegetables of this industrious insect where this abounds the cottager commonly carries out his hives in winter hiding them as he can from observation and fencing them from the annoyance of cattle there he leaves them till swarmingtime when they necessarily become the objects of his care and if he is fortunate his profits are considerable i knew a cottager who made above fifteen guineas in one year of his foresthoney tho he sold it only at three pence a pound sometimes the hive is discovered and stolen tho in general it is a garrison which can defend itself pretty well however as the prudent peasant never places all his wealth in one place he generally at worst secures enough to repay his trouble  hampshirehoney is in good esteem but it is rather the honey produced in the northern parts of the county than what is commonly called foresthoney  another species of fly should not be passed over which is one of the greatest nuisances of the forest in form it is not unlike the common black fly and about it is size but it is color is different it is a brightcoated brown insect wellcased strong and very retentive of life vivit cursitat immo coit dempto licet capite linneus de hippobosca  it has a sidelong crawling motion like a crab the horse is it is favorite quarry tho it attacks the cow and other animals you may sometimes see hundreds of these insects nestling under the tail and belly of such horses as are patient of them as the newforest horse commonly is by long sufferance but to such horses as are unaccustomed to these teasing insects they are a grievous torment tho it is doubtful whether they are bloodsuckers or subsist only on such juices as exude through the skin in this latter case they offend the horse only by tickling him for which operation their legs are well adapted appearing in a microscope armed with sharp talons like pothooks  such are the inmates of the internal parts of the forest along it is shores bordering on the isle of wight it is furnished with a new set of inhabitants  those various tribes of seafowl which frequent the brackish waters of an estuary  among the most common as well as the most beautiful is the gull waterfowl in a particular manner discover in their flight some determined aim they eagerly coast the river or return to the sea bent on some purpose of which they never lose sight but the evolutions of the gull appear capricious and undirected both when she flies alone and as she often does in large companies  the more however her character suffers as a loiterer the more it is raised in picturesque value by her continuing longer before the eye and displaying in her elegant sweeps along the air her sharppointed wings and bright silvery hue  she is beautiful also not only on the wing but when she floats in numerous assemblies on the water or when she rests on the shore dotting either one or the other with white spots which minute as they are are very picturesque and may properly be introduced in landscape giving life and spirit to a view seapainters particularly make great use of this bird and often with good effect the younger vandervelt was fond of introducing it he knew the value of a single bright touch in heightening his storms  as the wheeling motion of the gull is beautiful so also is the figured flight of the goose the duck and the widgeon all of which are highly ornamental to coastviews bays and estuaries we often see innumerable bodies of these and other seafowl congregated in close array and filling the air with their resounding cries see page      they are not hyperbolically described as  living clouds infinite wings till all the plumedark air and rude resounding shore are one wild cry in a picturesque light these living clouds are of little value unless indeed some wild forlorn and rocky coast is presented where these seafowls commonly breed and where in great bodies they are characteristic  among the solitary birds which frequent the estuaries of rivers the hern and the cormorant are of too much consequence to be omitted  the form in which the hern contracts his long neck in flying  his outstretched legs  the solemn flapping of his wings  his easy deliberation in taking the ground  the blueish tint of his plumes softening into white  and his patient and attentive posture as he stands fishing on the shore  are all circumstances as far as they go picturesque his hoarse note too at pausing intervals as he passes through the air tho harsh and discordant when unaided by it is proper accompaniments like other notes of the same kind when the scenes of nature act in concert with it has it is full energy and effect  i call the hern a solitary bird because his common habits and manner of seeking his food are solitary we seldom see more than two in company tho like the rook he breeds in large societies  nor is the cormorant without his beauty his eager steady determined flight  his plunging into the waters  his wild look as if conscious of guilt  his bustle on being alarmed shaking the moisture from his feathers and dashing about till he get fairly disengaged are all amusing circumstances in his history but he is a merciless villain supposed by naturalists to be furnished with a greater variety of predatory arts than any bird that inhabits the waters when the tide retires he wings his ardent flight with strong pinions and outstretched neck along the shores of the deserted river with all the channels and currents of which he is better acquainted than the mariner with his chart here he commits infinite spoil or if he find his prey less plentiful in the shallows he is at no loss in deeper water he dives to the bottom and visits the eel in her retirement of all others his favorite morsel see other parts of his history p       in vain the fowler eyes him from the bank and takes his stand behind the bush the cormorant quickersighted knows his danger and parries it with a glance of his eye if he choose not to trust his pinions in a moment he is under water  rises again in some distant part  instantly sinks a second time and eludes the possibility of taking aim even if a randomshot should touch him unless it carry a weight of metal his sides are so well cased and his muscular frame so robust that he escapes mischief  if the weather suit he fishes also dexterously at sea or perhaps he only varies his food between seafish and riverfish as his palate prompts  when he has filled his maw he retires to the ledge of some projecting rock where he listens to the surges below in dosing contemplation till hunger again awaken his powers of rapine  sect xii conclusion of the whole  thus i have carried my reader through all the varieties i know of woodland scenes i considered first the single tree as the origin and foundation of all i considered next the various combinations of trees under the several beautiful forms of scenery which they compose and as the forest is of all others the grandest and most interesting combination of trees i dwelt the longest on this part of my subject selecting newforest in hampshire as an example to illustrate the several observations i had made through this picturesque country i have led my reader geographically and have presented him with a great variety of beautiful scenes  woods  lawns  heaths  forestdistances  and seacoast views i have adorned these scenes also with their proper appendages wild horses deer and other picturesque inhabitants  i might greatly have multiplied both my general and particular remaks but i fear i ought rather to apologize for my redundances than my omissions  i now close my observations with a sigh over the transitory state of the several scenes i have described i mean not with unphilosophic weakness to bemoan the perishable condition of sublunary things but to lament only that of all sublunary things the woodlandscene which is among the most beautiful should be among the most perishable  some species of landscape are of permanent nature such particularly as depend on rocks mountains lakes and rivers the ornamental appendages indeed of these scenes the oaks and elms that adorn them are of a more transient kind but the grand constituent parts of them may be supposed coeval with nature itself nothing less than some general convulsion can injure them  such landscape again as depends for beauty on old castles abbeys and other ruins generally escapes for ages the depredations of time if the woody appendages of these scenes like those of lakes and mountains are open to injury yet a quick vegetation restores them speedily to nature  unless indeed the persevering hand of improvement intervene  but the landscape which depends chiefly on woodland scenery is always open to injury every graceless hand can fell a tree the value of timber is it is misfortune it is rarely suffered to stand when it is fit for use and in a cultivated country woods are considered only as large cornfieldsd cut as soon as ripe and when they are cut for the uses to which they are properly designed tho we may lament we should not repine but when they are cut as they often are yet immature to make up a matrimonial purse or to carry the profits of them to racegrounds and gaminghouses we cannot help wishing the profligate possessors had been placed like lunatics and idiots under the care of guardians who might have prevented such ruinous and unwarrantable waste  the depredations which we have seen made in every part of newforest and the vast quantities of timber which are felled every year for the navy and regularly assigned for various other purposes cannot but make a considerable change in it is scenery the description therefore which i have given of it is not the description of what it was in the last century nor of what it will be in the next many alterations in particular scenes have taken place even since this work was begun in a foreground the cutting down of two or three stately trees makes an essential alteration and much change of this kind has been made in many places in these instances therefore the remarks here offered must be considered as history rather than as description they attempt to chronicle scenes which once existed and are now gone that grand vista which has been described between brokenhurst and lyndhurst has since these remarks were made undergone much change many of the nobler trees which adorned it have been felled and many of the old decaying trees and others which had been stunted under the shade of those that had been felled are now grown still more decayed and ragged they are illclad and thin and their withered branches every where stare out unadorned and naked through their meagre foliage from these causes and the deformed gaps which the felling of good trees has occasioned this avenue has lost much of it is beauty  the reader will still remember that when in the early part of the work see vol i p    i considered the maladies of trees as a source of picturesque beauty i meant it only with regard to individuals placed in particular circumstances here where we are contemplating the beauties of what should be a rich forestscene they are out of place  it must however be added that although these changes are continually happening among the ancient oaks of the forest yet as young trees are growing old nature is also continually working up new foregrounds to her landscapes tho it is a much easier business to deform than to restore  in the distant scenery of the forest indeed where effect depends on vast combinations of trees and may be produced even from the inferior kinds the inroads of the axe are less observed tho the choicest oaks therefore may be removed yet if a sufficiency of meaner trees is left no considerable change will happen for many years in the distant landscapes of the forest the lawns and heaths in which it is greatest beauty consists will preserve their ornaments and unless where their dimensions are small in which case stately trees are required as foregrounds they may long remain the objects of admiration  the end index a ash described vol i page    animals figures of in stone and wood
