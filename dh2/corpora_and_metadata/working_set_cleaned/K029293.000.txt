hervey coming home  go  enter the house and prepare for his reception  i will wait his arrival here   servants exeunt enter juliana juliana good morning good old geoffry  i have once more eluded the vigilance of my persecutor  once more stolen forth from the castle purposely to visit this spot and if my father hears of it i hope he will not be angry with me  though he denies me his protection surely he will not preclude me from contemplating scenes that remind me of him and my dear mother  why what is the matter you seem agitated   geoffry well i may miss juliana  your father is arrived from italy and i expect him here this very day   juliana expect my father   geoffry ay after an absence of thirteen years i expect sir hervey once more at sutherlandhouse  look here is his letter   juliana snatching the letter reading and kissing it oh i am so happy  i shall at last behold perhaps embrace him   geoffry nay i fear otherwise sir hervey is of a most unforgiving disposition and the wrongs your mother put upon him were of a nature not easily to be forgotten   juliana wrongs  what wrongs geoffry is the dark tale for ever to be concealed from me  i am deserted by my father and not to know the cause  come good old man remember you promised you would one day tell me and since we are alone and may not have another opportunity come now  unveil the mystery  how how did my mother wrong him   geoffry well then to keep my word  sir hervey ever was and i fear ever will be a dupe to fashion and its follies  he gamed he intrigued  and though in his heart devoted to lady sutherland he forsook her and his home for scenes of riot and dissipation   juliana unfortunate infatuation   geoffry lady sutherland a long while bore this with fortitude and resignation but young beautiful and accomplished surrounded by admirers and neglected by her husband she at last listened to the addresses of an artful and designing villain who convinced her of sir herveys infidelity and by means of forged letters and other artifices persuaded her to elope with him   juliana indeed   geoffry it is too true madam  but her guilt was of short duration  in a few days she came back to that house all penitence and shame  i shall never forget the day  i told sir hervey of her return and he in a fit of rage and madness bid me shut the door against her this she overheard twas too much for a tender nature like hers  she fled and soon after died  died of a broken heart   juliana bursting into tears oh for mercy  my poor poor mother   geoffry you were then but eight years old and till that hour the idol of sir hervey  but your likeness to your mother soon making him wish to avoid you you were removed to the castle where he invested mrs dazzle with the unlimited power of a guardian over you and which i fear she has exerted like a tyrant   juliana yes  sir hervey could not mean that i should be her prisoner  but go on he went abroad    geoffry he did  to naples where he has ever since resided and now what think you madam do you blame the living or the dead   juliana i have no right to condemn either  but in my mind the husband who neglects an amiable wife is responsible for all the evils that ensue  died of a broken heart  oh that he had but pardoned her  then he had had a wife and i a mother to console me  but now  do i indeed resemble her   geoffry you do  you do   juliana thank heaven  i may forgive her though my father never can   worry speaking without this way my lad  this way   juliana ha there is sir hervey  though i wish you dont know how i dread to see him let me be gone   geoffry no it is only worry his old faithful follower honest soul he and your father were fostered by the same nurse and though long since in easy independent circumstances he still follows sir hervey from motives of affection  suppose you ask him to be a mediator for you   juliana not now  another time another time  i must return to my prison  but though i shed tears over the fate of my mother dont fancy i upbraid my father  no i feel for both  and let him still avoid still punish and abandon me i know his motive and the fond hope that he will one day prove a parent to me will make me bear even greater ills with patience  oh may that day be not far off for twill be the proudest and the happiest of my life   exit enter worry and a servant worry mind do as i order you when the baggage arrives let me know exit servant what geoff  give me your hand old geoff  sir hervey is but a stage behind  slife i thought we should never shake hands again   geoffry so did i it is thirteen years shaking hands and looking hard at worry but heyday how you are altered master worry   worry yes i am not the same man i was   geoffry so i see but how has it happened   worry i dont know  i lead a different sort of life  i think and i am afraid i drink a great deal   geoffry you drink you that used to be the most temperate sober    worry ay and i used to hate cards you know now i could play all day  i used to break appointments now i come an hour before my time  and i that always laid in bed till noon now constantly rise with the crowing of the cock   geoffry why what the deuce are you mad   worry no  i am married  i have got a loving jealous wife  and whilst sir hervey is continually miserable because lady sutherland ran away from him here am i  i tell you what geoff  if mrs worry were to run away from me i am sure i should be too much of a philosopher to repine on the occasion   geoffry what and is sir hervey likewise altered  or does he still go on rioting in dissipation and extravagance   worry worse and worse  only yesterday he employed mr alltrade to raise five thousand pounds for him on his bond  offered a premium of fifty per cent and the moment he receives the money away it will go in galas or at the gaming table  no i beg pardon  not at the gaming table  now a days no money ever goes there   geoffry what have they left off playing   worry no  but they have left off paying  and that is the reason the faro banks are knocked up  when people only play for love friendship will not induce them to keep open house  but miss sutherland  there is sir herveys greatest plague a meeting with her was his chief motive for leaving italy and now we understand she vindicates her mother and takes part against him   geoffry she is belied cruelly belied   worry nay we have it from the best authority  mrs dazzle  the lady who brought her up and for whom i have a message  but of this be assured geoff sir herveys case is not half so desperate as mine  he is only tormented by a daughter who will try to break his heart but i have got a jealous wife who will actually break my head heart and purse strings   reenter servant servant sir the baggage is come   worry you hear  mrs worry is arrived  come will you go and be introduced   geoffry with all my heart  but mind now  you will one day find that mrs dazzle has traduced miss sutherland and only because she was a great favorite of her late husbands he was a distant relation you know and i did hope would have remembered her in his will  but no  he like the rest of her family  he  has forgotten her   worry to be sure who ever got any good by these distant relations mrs worry has a little thousand and do you know my apartments are so constantly crammed with cousins neices uncles aunts and grandmothers that at dinnertime i never get a chair to sit upon  i eat flying  and talk of the comforts of a fireside curse me if i have been within ten yards of mine since the day i was married  not that i complain of cold though  my house is warm enough i promise you  but come along and sorry am i to be convinced of miss sutherlands ingratitude  were she the girl you describe i would not only be her friend and advocate but if sir hervey refused to protect her i would myself be a father to her   exeunt scene  an apartment in the castle enter mrs dazzle and betty betty even so maam miss juliana first robbed you of your husbands friendship and now of the captains love   mrs dazzle oh the little viper  but i know how to be amply revenged  the great object of her life is a reconciliation with her father  this i have already prevented and will still prevent  but the captain betty  do you think he has serious views   betty he serious what captain lavish prefer juliana sutherland without a shilling to the widow dazzle with a nett estate of five thousand a year   mrs dazzle that is true  i married little jerry for his fortune and i am certainly sole heiress  to be sure i havnt yet seen the will because he died in london  but i expect his agent mr alltrade with it every moment and then betty  poor juliana  i hope the captain will allow her half pay   betty oh youre too liberal maam  but see here comes mr alltrade with the will   enter alltrade alltrade well madam as good as my word you see  this moment arrived with my friend sir hervey   mrs dazzle you are very kind mr alltrade but there was no occasion to be in any hurry  every body knows how little jerry loved me   alltrade oh there is no doubt that the will is completely in your favor but you had better open it lest there should be any small bequest or legacies    mrs dazzle well to oblige you i will just cast my eye over it   takes the will from alltrade poor jerry  he used to say he should fall a martyr to love reads will by this my last will i jeremiah dazzle give and bequeath all the property of which i die possessed unto that most lovely and accomplished of her sex  spare me  spare a poor widows blushes mr alltrade   alltrade nay it is not more than you deserve   mrs dazzle oh sir curtseying  then reads on  unto that most lovely and accomplished of her sex juliana sutherland  juliana  why mr alltrade half crying   alltrade go on   mrs dazzle reads on juliana sutherland whom being deserted by her father i take a pride in adopting but my will further is that she hold the said property no longer than she remains unmarried in case she marries i give the same to my widow deborah dazzle and my only motive for thus tying up my cousin juliana is to save her from entering into a state to which i fell a martyr  why it is a forgery he could not  dared not   alltrade nay  there is no doubt that it is genuine  but be composed  does not miss sutherland live in this house   mrs dazzle she does   alltrade then it dawns it glares upon me  mark  if she marries the estate devolves to you  are not these mr dazzles words   mrs dazzle they are and i only wish i had been behind him when he wrote them   alltrade well be patient  dont destroy the will because that is a serious business pulling up his neckcloth  only conceal it till you get juliana a husband  then she forfeits the legacy and you become heiress to a hundred thousand pounds   mrs dazzle why that looks well  but how  the captain will not marry her   alltrade no but i will in the first place her being in this house will give me numberless opportunities and in the next i am employed by sir hervey to raise five thousand pounds for him on his bond  now if we can get juliana to join in it i shall have them both so completely in my power that if i fail in the character of a lover i may succeed in that of a creditor  you understand   mrs dazzle i do  excellent  and as a reward for your trouble    alltrade i only ask a third of the estate   mrs dazzle granted  it is a bargain   alltrade say you so  then let us to work instantly  and look here comes one who from his influence over sir hervey we must secure as a confederate   enter worry mrs dazzle worry my old acquaintance  i give you joy of your marriage and sincerely wish you may never know the pangs of widowhood   alltrade and so do i with all my heart worry   worry and i wish with all my soul you would both keep your wishes to yourselves aside  but i wait upon you madam from sir hervey  from your account of miss sutherlands undutiful and indiscreet conduct he persists in not seeing her and therefore while he stays in the country he begs she may be more closely confined than ever   mrs dazzle i will do all i can but she is so artful and designing that for my part i dont think she will ever be safe till she gets a husband to protect her   alltrade nor i and i will tell you a secret worry  i love her and wish to be that husband and since from my humble birth and inferior situation i cannot aspire to gaining sir herveys consent will you aid and assist the marriage   worry with all my heart  the more matches the better  when ones in a scrape oneself nothings so consoling as to see all ones friends in the same situation aside i will assist you  but about the bond  have you raised the five thousand pounds   alltrade no and i despair of success  the friend i applied to wants miss sutherland to join   worry she join why she is as poor    alltrade i know  but he says she has rich relations  may have a handsome legacy  in short it will mend the security  therefore let sir hervey know this and he will see the necessity of commanding her to sign instantly  worry is going mrs dazzle good day worry  i shall be always glad to see you and because there is a hatchment over my door dont fancy this is absolutely the house of mourning   worry no maam  i  i   laughing and trying to conceal it mrs dazzle why what do you laugh at  speak out  you will not offend me   worry shall not i maam  then begging your pardon you neednt have cautioned me for i always look on a hatchment outside of a widows house like a sign over an inn  a certain emblem of revelry and good cheer  and when i am a widower  oh oh oh  shakes his head sighs and exit alltrade so far so well he is in our interest  but to get this bond out of sir herveys hands we must at least advance a few hundreds and where to raise even those  for my part i havent a guinea   mrs dazzle nor i now a shilling  sighing nor do i know where to raise one   alltrade no   mrs dazzle no unless indeed mr mist the manager of our country theater    alltrade what the quondam silversmith of cheapside  he is an old friend of mine   mrs dazzle is he  then you may aid my suit  you must know smitten with the love of same eager to acquire the reputation of wit and genius i have written a most magnificent play which of course i am all anxiety to see acted he has already promised to come and read it and if it meets with his approbation very likely he may advance the money necessary to pay sir hervey   alltrade true  suppose i hasten his visit  i will seek him instantly and whilst you keep juliana out of sight i will keep the will out of sight  putting will in his pocket  and with regard to the play if you get money by it depend on it you will get reputation also one generally follows the other   mrs dazzle so it does  and how the case is altered  formerly wits had no money and now he that has no money has no wit for whilst a bad joke will be applauded from the head of a great able a good one will be lost if spoken by him who has nothing but wit to recommend him  but away to the manager  let the war begin and doubt not our victory   exeunt scene  outside of the theater enter stopgap

that geoffry spoke of  what can he want  advances toward him  may i ask  i hope sir herveys well   worry no he is very ill i am very much obliged to you   juliana ill  heavens  what is his complaint   worry an ungrateful daughter  your pardon maam  perhaps i am somewhat blunt  but i have lived with sir hervey these twenty years if he has faults to others he has none to me and though the world deserts him it is my duty to stand or fall with him   juliana well i applaud your zeal but why why charge me with ingratitude   worry because you are his enemy because you take the part of her who basely wronged him   juliana hold censure me as much as you please but breathe not a syllable against my mother   worry there you avow it you justify    juliana no  but i feel for her i lament her fate that consolation sir hervey cannot deny me  and let him know me before he condemns me for how can that child be called ungrateful who never had an opportunity of evincing either her duty or affection   worry how   juliana i never wronged him and even in my infancy he shut his doors against me  i am his child and by denying his protection he has exposed me to the selfsame snares my mother fell a martyr to  i have not disgraced  i have ever loved him and let him give me but the trial  oh let him take me to his heart and if the caresses of an affectionate daughter do not atone for the errors of a misguided mother then let him cast me from him but till then let him not accuse me of ingratitude   worry what and you would  how handsome she looks  you would be loving and dutiful   juliana oh yes  i would watch i would nurse him  weep as he wept and bless each smile that cheered him and when time had mellowed his grief into a sweet remembrance of my mothers loss then i would retrieve her honor in the grave  in my unvaried truth all all should be forgotten i would revive the friendship that he bore her and she should live again in juliana   worry bless my soul  now only think of my not marrying such a woman  and if he wanted money and you had it to lend him    juliana if i had millions i would devote them all to him   worry old geoffs right  may i never go to heaven if she is not an angel  and if the widow is not something else may i go somewhere else   juliana ay mrs dazzle she is my persecutor from the hour i accidentally interfered with her in captain lavishs affection she    worry captain lavish  what your fathers antagonist  the man who two years ago fought him in switzerland   juliana alas the same   worry and did you return his affection   juliana what could i do  he risked his own life to save mine  it is but a short and simple tale  one day when i had liberty to ride within the precincts of the castle my horse ran away with me and he in stopping it broke his arm i could do no less than confess the obligation and since his recovery often visiting mrs dazzle our intimacy increased and gratitude grew into love   worry and all the time did you know of the duel   juliana no till yesterday i never heard of it and then i instantly informed him that though sir hervey neglected his duty to me i could never forget mine to him and nothing should induce me to receive that man as a lover who designed to be the murderer of my father worry crosses her as if going  why what is the matter  where are you going   worry to sir hervey to bid him remove you from the protection of a hypocrite and place you under his own   juliana oh will you  will you be so generous indeed in this castle i am not safe a moment   worry no  nor any body else for the roof will tumble in to a certainty but i will go directly and if i fail and the war continues  let the enemy look to it  i have served many a hard campaign and though not lately in the battles abroad thanks to mrs worry i have seen pretty warm service at home and sooner than you should remain under the rod of a tyrant i would storm the castle and revive the age of chivalry  yes  i would  i will worry the married man  so retire and wait my coming madam  i will not be long   juliana i am sure you will not and pray remind my father that i have suffered in my turn that we are partners in calamity and by meeting we might divide and dissipate each others woes  tell him  but you know my thoughts and to your conduct i commit a cause on which my hope my happiness my life depends   exeunt

lavishs house  recess with small folding doors which are thrown open and discover a marble pedestal surrounded by doves and cupids  a table with wine and refreshments upon it enter frank and a workman frank ha ha so you have no sooner finished that whimsical outoftheway job pointing to the recess  than he sends for you about another   workman ay your master is an excellent customer  always up to his chin in brick and mortar and then for price  gad he never haggles about price   frank no and the best of the joke is he calls himself an economist and comes down here on a saving scheme   workman a saving scheme   frank ay finding himself a little out of elbows in london and the present state of the continent not allowing him to travel he came here to live cheap and retrench  and there pointing to recess again  there is one specimen of his economy  on the journey he bought a statue of venus   workman i know and a great bargain it was it only cost him five pounds   frank true but not choosing to have his beauties gazed at he employed you to build that strange sort of recess to put it in which has cost him at least five times the sum  this is always the way if he bought a cheap boat he would cut a canal for it and if a pulpit he would build a church for it  in fact he is a false economist  a selfdeceiver and here he comes to elucidate my description   enter lavish lavish oh if i go on in this close saving way only six months longer i shall be able to return to town and dash like the best of them  never was such a hand at buying bargains  frank come here you rogue  just now at squire broziers sale what do you think i gave for a curricle  only forty pounds  there there is economy for you   frank economy  begging your pardon sir  i see no economy in buying what you dont want   lavish how  would you let a bargain flip through your fingers you extravagant rascal   frank no  but you have no horses sir and a curricles useless    lavish that is what i said says i a curricle is useless without horses  so i bought a pair directly   frank bought a pair   lavish ay gave a hundred and twenty pounds for them  to be sure it is money but ones own carriage saves posting and drivers in short the worst come to the worst it is but a hundred and fifty pounds and i will save it a thousand ways  who are you sir  to workman workman i have finished that job all but fixing up the statue sir and now i come about the billiardroom  but to speak honestly it is not worth repairing   lavish so i thought i thought it was not worth repairing   workman no sir and a new room will not cost above three hundred pounds  but then to be sure it will be elegant and lasting   lavish so it will and the first expense is the least so up with the new room  workman exit  and now to finish my vindication to juliana  sits at the table and writes  your late mother was not only my relation but my friend and benefactress and on sir herveys one day reprobating her conduct with unusual asperity gratitude prompted me to defend it perhaps more warmly than i ought and a duel was the result  knocking at the door  see who is there  frank exit  but what signifies writing while she is immured in her present den i havent a chance of success  mrs dazzle formerly seduced me into some gallantries and a disappointed widow is the devil   reenter frank laughing frank sir i beg pardon for laughing but who do you think is at the door  no less a gentleman than the one you caned at newmarket about four years ago   lavish caned  oh i recollect  i detected him in an act of forgery  but what does the fellow want  i dont know his name nor have i once seen him since   frank no and though he now asks for captain lavish he little thinks you are the gentleman he is under such obligations to   lavish show him up frank exit  introduce the newmarket gentleman to his two old antagonists the captain and his cane  and in the mean time   sits at table and takes up pen again enter frank and alltrade frank this way sir  there that is my master   pointing to lavish whose back is turned toward alltrade alltrade oh that is captain lavish is it  sir i wait upon you    lavish not regarding him yes the widow is so jealous and so violent  turns round  how do you do my fine fellow  how do you do  my newmarket hero sure enough   aside alltrade trembling amazement why it is the very man who    lavish what is the matter  you seem cold  shall i warm you   alltrade warm me  no  i    lavish some wine  give the gentleman some wine  this is the house of frugality and therefore i cannot offer you a great variety but as far as burgundy madeira and champagne  must drink them if i save it a thousand ways   alltrade sir you will exeuse me  why surely i have mistaken my man  he would never be so civil at all events he dont recollect me so i will pluck up courage  aside  sir i wait upon you from sir hervey sutherland he arrived here today and knowing of your love for his daughter    lavish came down to increase her confinement i suppose   alltrade no trifling sir he is convinced you are concerned in her elopement    lavish elopement  how  what  juliana eloped   alltrade you know she has sir and sir hervey insists    lavish eloped  juliana free  out of the widows and her fathers custody  which way did she go  what road did she take  speak speak this instant   alltrade i speak  if i knew of course you would be the last man i should give information to   lavish indeed   alltrade certainly  sir hervey is my friend and if his daughter is not at present in your power i shall unite

begone this instant  and do you hear if youre not satisfied with this treatment call again and i will give you a warmer reception   shaking his cane alltrade exit  and now for juliana  now for the idol of my soul  frank get the curricle no i shall only hurry and lame my own horses  get a chaise and four   frank chaise and four  is this the way to retrench  and consider sir miss sutherland has no money and you always said you would never marry any woman who had less than ten thousand pounds   lavish i did but that is an awkward sum a woman with ten thousand pounds expects houses horses carriages  in short to spend double her own income and her husbands too but a woman without a farthing she manages the house mends the linen nurses the children scolds the servants  oh that is the real rich wife  and the poor juliana will be the best bargain i ever made  so go do as i tell you and observe i will marry her if i sacrifice my whole fortune in the pursuit   frank sacrifice your whole fortune sir   lavish ay i will if i save it a thousand ways   exeunt scene  outside of lavishs house enter mrs dazzle  her hat and cloak on mrs dazzle so now to enter this perfidious captains

recover my husbands hundred thousand pounds and i will warrant i will recover my captain he like the rest of the world will not visit virtue in a cottage but place me in a magnificent house  ay there is the secret  nowadays people visit the building not the owner of it and on the size of the rooms and the number of the entertainments we may not only calculate our friends and admirers but also the good and bad opinion of the whole fashionable world   exit into lavish s house enter worry and juliana juliana look out we are pursued  i am sure they were mrs dazzles servants   worry they were but we have outrun them   juliana yes but if they come up with us i shall be forced back and endure increased persecution  oh i wish we were safe at this mr mists house   worry so do i  though you see what a strange gentleman he is  he left us to examine the first slow wagon we met but dont despond madam  i will not leave you  no i will die first   juliana kind  generous but i cannot bear to involve you remember you have a wife and    worry remember  i shall never forget it   juliana nay but a husband is of so much consequence to his family    worry bless you i am of no consequence nobody ever wants me  if any body leaves a card it is for mrs worry  if any body sends an invitation it is for mrs worry  if an invitation is sent in return it is still mrs worry nobody calls or asks after the husband except indeed the tradespeople  they are kind enough now and then to notice me but like other great married men i am obliged to be out when they call so curse me if i have even the pleasure of being at home to a dun but we waste time let us proceed to mr mists house   juliana ay for heavens sake dispatch    alltrade without you take that side of the road i will take this  she cannot escape then   juliana there it is mr alltrades voice  and both sides of the road are guarded by enemies   worry yes it is all over  we are between two fires  which way shall we go   pointing to lavish s door that door stands most invitingly open suppose we enter it   juliana do  instantly why what is the matter you were quite valiant just now   worry i was but i fancy my courage is more like a new acquaintance than an old friend  professes a great deal at first but generally sneaks off in the hour of danger however lead on  and let us hope to receive from strangers that protection which friends have denied us   exeunt into lavish s house enter alltrade alltrade so  there she goes into captain lavishs house bravo miss juliana  and there she may stay for me i will to sir hervey

inside lavishs house recess etc as in first scene of this act enter lavish and mrs dazzle lavish now you have searched every part of the house now are you satisfied miss sutherland is not concealed in it  sdeath to detain me at such a moment   aside mrs dazzle no  she is not in the house i grant you but the chaise the chaise and four  pray most economical captain do you usually travel with four horses   lavish always  it is by far the cheapest plan it shortens the journey saves stopping at inns in short the additional shilling is no object and if i had but ten pounds a year i would always travel with four horses  and now my dear widow allow me to see you home   mrs dazzle take care sir  disappointed love knows no bounds and recollect it is in my power to expose you to my rival  i have your letters in my possession  letters in which you laugh and rail at marriage  letters    lavish nay be patient  there now this it is to be dragooned into an attachment  she has me by all that is frugal  aside  come then sit down and let us drink to the revival of our friendship  see here is famous madeira  ay you may stare but this too is on the cheapest plan i promise you for while it takes two bottles of port to make me drunk one of madeira does it completely  so here is to the rival  tapping hard at stage door p s  why what is that ha   mrs dazzle mercy  somebodys coming  for heavens sake dont let me be seen  i will step into this room   goes to stage door o p and tapping beard there worry outside the door madam where are you madam   mrs dazzle why what is all this  it is done on purpose to expose me  oh mr lavish if you have either feeling or gallantry think of my situation a widow only a fortnight and to be detected alone in a captains house    lavish well step into that recess  quick quick  mrs dazzle in her hurry drops her cloak then enters recess and lavish fastens the door upon her  so  there i have you fast and now   taking his cane from the table juliana outside

sir  when i took refuge in this house i little thought to meet you  good day sir  going lavish what now  the very moment that i have found you   juliana what can i do mr lavish  i own i owe you obligations  nay more  i confess i could have loved you  but i have told you my determination  you are my fathers enemy  therefore we cannot be friends  farewell sir   lavish mighty well madam mighty well  but this is not your real motive  you love another you love this mr worry  answer me heartily maam  did he not run away with you   juliana he did  but    lavish he did  then may i run into every species of extravagance if when i catch him i dont give him the newmarket flourish shaking his cane  where is he  where is this mr worry   enter worry worry here at your service sir   lavish this my rival  this ancient wizen dowagerlike  dont be unmanly lavish  never strike an old woman i entreat you throwing away his cane  besides now i look at him it is it is sir herveys  you dear amiable agreeable  one mrs worry is sufficient for you or the devils in it   worry very likely sir but if you have no rival in an old woman as you please to call me i fancy miss sutherland has when i listened at the door i will swear i heard the widows voice   lavish the widow  no juliana  i can prove myself as great an economist in love as in money   worry are you sure you can sir   lavish sure  if since the hour i first beheld her i havent treasured every thought hoarded every look  stored    worry  pointing to mrs dazzle s cloak on the ground pray sir who does that cloak belong to   lavish that cloak  oh that cloak is one of my bargains   worry is it then you buy very dear bargains i fancy  look madam  taking up clock is not it mrs dazzles   juliana it is and since this confirms what i have long suspected i have now an additional motive for avoiding you  mr lavish we never meet again  come   to worry worry  to lavish i say if you dont hoard your money better than your love never think of matrimony  you will find it too expensive a bargain for you i promise you  going sir hervey sutherland without where is he  where is captain lavish   lavish sir hervey slife what brings him here   juliana my father oh heavens and to find me under the roof of his enemy    worry and me also  mrs worry herself couldnt terrify me more  come along madam and let us leave the captain to stand the brunt    juliana ay lose not a moment  and oh mr lavish as this is the last time we shall ever meet remember the parting words of her you once regarded  pacify my father do not incence him  be his friend and spite of your falsehood and unkindness you may still be mine   worry and mine  ha ha there is another bad bargain for him   juliana exit  worry is following when lavish lays bold of him and prevents his going holloa what is the matter   enter sir hervey sir hervey so mr lavish it is still doomed that we are to meet as enemies  where is miss sutherland sir   lavish sir hervey on the honor of a gentleman i know nothing of your daughters elopement for any further information i refer you to mr worry  pushing worry forwards i say who has the best of the bargain now   sir hervey sdeath i have a great mind   advancing toward worry and stopping  but he is only agent  to you as principal i look for reparation and redress  hear me sir  mrs dazzle a lady of the strictest truth and honor  she first informed me of your infamous designs and now  not half an hour ago a friend on whose word i can equally rely saw miss sutherland enter this very house therefore there is no alternative but this  instantly restore her or  you guess the result   lavish i do  but i will waste no more powder sir hervey   sir hervey how   lavish no dying is certainly a cheap mode of living and to a man in desperate circumstances a duel may be a good saving scheme but having hoarded enough to make life comfortable why i am a cursed fool if i dont save it a thousand ways  sits down sir hervey poor paltry prevarication  remember mr lavish we were once friends  i treated you as a son  you esteemed me as a parent  and what dissolved that friendship  you chose to vindicate the honor of a false wife and call me to the field  did i not come   lavish you did sir   sir hervey and now where is your consistency  you would bring my daughter to the same degraded state you would reduce her to the level of her mother and when an injured father asks for satisfaction you refuse to give it him  what is this but cowardice plain unequivocal cowardice   lavish cowardice ill as miss sutherland has treated me i never meant to raise my arm against her father  but when you allude to the memory of her i owe such obligations to and say i would reduce her daughter to the same degraded state  it is past bearing  i cannot endure it and you may shoot me as soon as you please   sir hervey here are the weapons then    putting pistol into lavish s hand worry hold sir he is innocent miss sutherland is slandered  the lady your friend saw enter this house was a very different person  it was the widow indeed it was the widow   sir hervey mrs dazzle   worry ay it is she that carries on an amor with the captain and though i cannot produce her to prove it i can at least produce a part of her  look sir  do you see this cloak   sir hervey away it is my unfeeling daughters and the sight so heightens my resentment  come sir wrongs like mine will brook no more delay and you must either meet a cowards or a villains fate    lavish coward again  come then  here is my ground  goes up stage worry  stopping sir hervey dont think me impertinent sir  but while you as a man of honor think it your duty to fight a duel i as an honest man think it mine to prevent it  it is the widow upon my soul it is the widow   holding sir herveys arm who struggles to get it loosened sir hervey distraction  nay then  thus    throws worry violently from him who falling against doors of recess they burst open and mrs dazzle is discovered standing on the pedestal surrounded by doves etc worry who has fallen at her feet still looking up in her face it is the widow  upon my soul it is the widow   sir hervey amazement  can that be mrs dazzle   lavish no  it is a statue  you see it is a statue    mrs dazzle rises walks quickly down the stage and exit worry halloa will not you take your cloak along with you you will want it to cover your sins   sir hervey hypocrite i now view her in her true colors and i am doomed to be the dupe of woman  mr lavish i see my friend was mistaken and i acknowledge i have wronged you   lavish psha  i want no acknowledgment  if you wish to make me amends stay and dine with me  mine is the system of economy and as i cannot lay out money to better advantage than in entertaining an old friend i will give you a dinner fit for the court of aldermen  i will if i save it a thousand ways   sir hervey excuse me sir  your innocence on the present occasion will not do away former injuries nor will mrs dazzles bad conduct be an apology for my daughters  no  whilst i thought love the cause of her elopement it was my duty to pursue and save her  but since i see selfinterest is the motive and that she fled to avoid signing an instrument which would have saved me from disgrace and not have injured her  i shall no longer condescend to seek her   worry it is no such thing sir  and if you will go to her at mr mists house    sir hervey peace  and instantly attend me home where if the account of your own conduct prove not satisfactory  worry attempts to speak  nay this is no place for explanation  go on before  mr lavish i have the honor to wish you good evening   worry and sir hervey exeunt lavish here is bad reckoning  it is well i calculate better in money matters but what is to be done  he said she was gone to mr mists  well if i follow her she will not see me  if i write to her she will not answer my letter  oh she is lost  julianas lost to me for ever   enter frank frank sir is the chaise to wait   lavish not regarding him and yet  if i could gain an interview  harkye frank  do you know any body at mr mists the managers   frank yes and so do you sir  stopgap who left your service to go on the stage is now his prompter   lavish that is fortunate  i will go to him instantly and if he will but do me a favor    frank that he will if you will bribe him only give him ten pounds  but that you know sir will not suit your system of economy   lavish will not it  ten pound is no object and i have lately made so many good bargains that it is d  d hard if i cannot afford to throw away an odd bank note or two  so come along  and if after all i do live a little beyond my income it is no fault of mine frank   frank no whose is it then sir   lavish whose  why it is the fault of those selfish harpies who make economy useless  who raise the price of every article  and if sir hervey and other fighting gentlemen would unload their pistols on jobbers forestallers and monopolizers their valor would be directed to the best purposes  i might live cheap and the country would be cleared of it is worst enemies   exeunt the end of the third act act iv scene  outside of a

do  i do and well i know the author of them all  too well i know the father that has caused them   juliana my father do you know my father  oh when you see him dont tell him you found me in prison that would afflict him and it would double my misery to add to his  dont  pray dont tell him sir   sir hervey why not  why feel for him who never felt for you has he not from your infancy deserted you  has he not shut his doors against you and instead of being your friend and protector has he not proved himself your enemy  your persecutor   juliana haughtily well if he has sir   sir hervey did he not thwart you in your affections  tear you from the man you love and command you to marry him you hate  and after these accumulated injuries and you had involved yourself to support him what was his return ingratitude what was your inheritance poverty  what has been your reward a prison  oh villain villain  worst of villains   juliana villain  hold your unlicensed tongue villain  who are you that dare thus accuse my father   sir hervey a libertine whose dissipation drove his wife into such scenes of error and remorse that she died of a broken heart  an outcast who not content with that would have reduced his daughter to the same unhappy fate  a wretch who abandoned her not for her own conduct but her mothers  who brought her to a prison  who sees her there without the hope of saving her  or to sum up all in one emphatic word  to give the aggregate of complicated infamy  i am your father   juliana my father   sir hervey ay look at me  view me well  do you not shudder at the hideous sight will you not curse  avoid me as a pestilence  a fiend   juliana no i will cling to you  thus grow for ever round you throwing herself into his arms  my father my dear dear father   sir hervey juliana be merciful  load me with reproaches  this kindness will destroy me   juliana reproach you  what at the moment i have sound you  no let me but be near you and i will bless the hour that brought me to this place  for it has given me the utmost wishes of my soul  it has restored to me a parent   enter alltrade and worry worry there it is as i expected they are reconciled  look have you the heart to interrupt their joy   alltrade sir hervey i have no wish but to give you both liberty and if you will fulfill your promise by persuading miss sutherland to accept my hand  nay why frown  you see i come as a friend   sir hervey friend away  i am weary of the very word   alltrade what weary of friendship sir hervey   sir hervey ay sir time was when friendship wore a bold and open aspect and as it spoke it acted but now it is masked and underneath it lurks all modern villainy who betrayed my wife a friend  who belied my child a friend  who immured her in a gaol and if she does not prostitute her hand and heart will see her perish there  who but my friend  can my enemy thus injure me  no in him i place no confidence or trust and henceforth let me rather meet a thousand foes than the designing arts of one false friend   alltrade well as you please   enter lavish behind  here is miss sutherlands discharge but since you dont choose to accede to my proposals good night  showing discharge and putting it up again juliana nay let me entreat you mr alltrade   worry and let me entreat you mr alltrade   alltrade no i can be obstinate in my turn  good night   lavish  advancing and turning alltrade round then let me entreat you mr alltrade  nay dont think to escape sir  bless you you are quite mistaken mr alltrades the most kind obliging  the discharge  give me the discharge you scoundrel  or else newmarket in the first place shaking his cane and high life in the second  pulling up his neckcloth alltrade trembling violently well sir  since you insist sir    lavish i do and be quick  dispatch  alltrade gives lavish a paper oh this is the very thing i suppose  begins reading it  by this my last will i jeremiah dazzle give and bequeath    alltrade stop stop  that is the wrong paper  here here is the discharge   lavish takes it and puts it into his pocket very well  a good economist pockets every thing  reads on all the property of which i die possessed unto that most amiable  juliana sutherland  amazement  sir hervey juliana and lavish all look at each other with astonishment and during pause alltrade exit there  you take care of that sir hervey whilst i take care of mr   turns round and finds alltrade gone  what gone  i will follow him  i will  but no  we have got all we want from him  and so spite of our former animosities sir hervey allow me to congratulate you   sir hervey having read the will no sir my hopes are vanished i find here the fortune is conditional  if my daughter marries it devolves to mrs dazzle   lavish if she marries   sir hervey ay sir  while she remains single she may roll in affluence and i be restored to all my former splendour  but will that give either of us consolation no my own sad example has taught me the reverse and therefore mark me juliana  i wish to make atonement to give you fixed unceasing happiness  and having proved myself unfit to guard so dear a charge  let him who best deserves let him protect you   juliana him  whom sir   sir hervey  pointing to lavish him  accept her mr lavish  take her as the best recompense for all the wrongs i have done you  nay i know the penalty  i know by marrying you she forfeits this estate and for your sake i wish it had accompanied her but for my own  at last i have acted as a parent ought and though these gates are ever shut against me i know my daughters happy and that thought will give what wealth can never purchase  a quiet conscience and unbroken rest   lavish sir hervey you have acted nobly  but    sir hervey but what  you are sufficiently affluent to maintain her   lavish no there is the curse on it i thought i had saved a fortune  but just now when i heard of your mutual distress and drew bills on my steward and my banker they refused payment  to my astonishment they said i had not a shilling  there you see there is the end of my economy   sir hervey and you would have paid my debts  you would have released your enemy   lavish ay that i would if i would saved it a thousand ways  but to marry on such conditions  no  i will die first   juliana and so will i and hard as it is here let us separate mr lavish   sir hervey never  never shall you be divided  and though we can expect no liberality from mrs dazzle yet under all the circumstances she may be induced to compromise  perhaps allow us a moiety or a third   lavish ay or any thing  if she will only allow us two hundred a year with my management i will be bound well all live comfortably  i will go make her proposals instantly and dont fear my success  for at a bargain  never was such a fellow at making a bargain   juliana adieu mr lavish pray heaven you may succeed   worry so say i and if she dont come to an amicable adjustment contest the will and employ my nephew to file a bill in chancery against her   lavish no that will never do rather give up the whole property than go to law  come that is good economy or the devils in it   exit sir hervey come juliana in my apartments well wait his return   to worry you also faithful constant friend   juliana how shall i thank you how repay    worry repay  look are you not reconciled is not that repaying me  oh i am the happiest fellow living  no  i forgot mrs worry   exeunt op scene  a street in the town enter alltrade mrs dazzle and a servant mrs dazzle dont talk to me sir  the will discovered   alltrade i tell you

captain and is not it exactly as i suspected  take my word for it juliana will keep the estate and her lover too   alltrade how what mean you   mrs dazzle mean that the captain never thought of making her his wife and the father to gain his liberty and five thousand a year will be unprincipled enough to consent to his daughters disgrace   alltrade oh i understand now  live together without marrying   mrs dazzle ay mr lavish not only didnt deny the infamous scheme but absolutely offered me two hundred a year if i would give up all claim under my husbands will if not he said he and juliana would go to italy and live on the profits what shall i do  deprived of my husbands estate i am absolutely pennyless   alltrade i know and you see they are decided therefore why hesitate  two hundred a year is certainly better than nothing   mrs dazzle true and as i have no other hope  john go to mr lavish say i accede to his proposals and if he will bring an agreement to my house i will sign directly servant exit oh that it should come to this  but i will expose them  i will    enter stopgap with a letter stopgap from mr mist madam  it is of the utmost consequence and requires an immediate answer

in lots knocked down a sturdy farmer bought the walls  why then what was a barn will be a barn again corn on the stage not mummers will be seen and oats be threshd where actors should have been wheat strew the boards where erst did heroes tread to make  what heroes never made there  bread stagestruck but henpeckd honest justice dunder has all my clouds  his lady has my thunder dick drench the snug apothecary means to give a private play so buys my scenes drench smelling of the shop and idem semper could not resist scenes painted in distemper the member for the town bought all my coats there he was wise  for i command two votes and playhouse coats again he showed discerning will suit a member for they are used to turning my wigs the women quarreled for sweet souls my daggers stuck in selling but my bowls mine host of the red lion clapped his eyes on and bought em as i did to serve up poison thus all my country stock as shakspeare says my cloudcapt towers my gorgeous palaces yea my great globe the barn so much involved and all it did inherit have dissolved but if some future manager should take my solemn temple which i now forsake my fabric of a vision he will find that i have left a cursed wreck behind here then i come by rural schemes half undone but country stumps appear new brooms in london egad i will sweep all clean  look to it  never doubt me  a london manager i will lay
