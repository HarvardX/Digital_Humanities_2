descriptive account of spain continued chap ix continued of madrid the rich subjects of spain concentrate all their pleasures within the capital music and dancing are the two for which the spaniards have the greatest predilection they have also their tertulias and refrescos the tertulias are assemblies very similar to those of france women in general seek not many occasions to assemble each aspires to be the center of a tertusia women are there admired and even adored as well as elsewhere but when they inspire not a lively sentiment the men seldom pay them those attentions which french politeness prodigally bestows on every individual of the fairsex it is not in the reciprocal communication of tenderness that the manners are softened on the contrary it is in the disinterested association of the two sexes that the necessity and desire of pleasing arises which forms the charm and cement of society  their refrescos the invention of luxury and greediness contribute no less than the tertulias to facilitate the intercourse of the sexes in general these are only slight repasts prepared for persons from whom visits are received and as a prelude to the tertulias but on extraordinary occasions as a wedding christening or celebrating the birthday of the head of the family the refresco becomes an important and expensive affair all the friends of the family are invited and as they arrive the men separate from the women the lady of the house receives them under a canopy over which is suspended an image of the virgin the appearance of the refresco at length enlivens every countenance conversation becomes more animated and the sexes approach each other the company are first presented with large glasses of water in which little sugarloaves are dissolved these are succeeded by chocolate the favorite refreshment twice a day of the spaniards and believed to be so nourishing and innocent as not to be refused even to the sick after the chocolate come all sorts of confectionary  it is scarcely possible to conceive the profusion with which these delicacies are distributed the company is not only cloyed with them but their hats their handkerchiefs and pockets are loaded with them  a ball or cardtables commonly succeed the refresco but these entertainments are seldom concluded with a supper this is always a frugal repast with the spaniards at which they rarely assemble  barettis account of their assemblies is rather different it is a custom says he among the spanish ladies to send invitations to their friends to come and see them some even several times a month others not so often when a lady intends this she sends word to her female acquaintance that on such an evening she shall have a tertulia the lady who receives this message tells the gentlemen of her acquaintance that on such an evening she shall go to the tertulia of such a lady which is considered as an invitation to one of these says the above writer i was invited on alighting from the carriage the servants who rode behind with flambeaux lighted us up a large staircase there being no porter at the gate as in england the master of the house received us at the door of his apartment and handed the lady that was with us into that where his wife was with the other ladies who were assembled my friend who conducted me and myself were then introduced into a room full of gentlemen almost all dressed in laced coats  some were sitting others standing and either gazing or talking about them as is usual in large companies presently some servants after having been round to the ladies brought us in some refreshments the manner of serving them was singular a footman first gave each person a silver plate another followed him with silver salvers loaded with biscuits made of sugar hollow like a sponge and extremely light each of us took one with a glass of lemonade upon being dipped into which it instantly dissolved chocolate was then distributed which being drank the servants came round for the cups and silver plates  we then continued a little longer in conversation when behold the lady of the house came out of her apartment followed by all those who were with her we formed ourselves into two rows one on each side of them none of the ladies passed by without having something respectful or affectionate said to them their answers to which were in the same strain at the end of the room where we were was another into which the ladies entered without any ceremony whether young or old married or unmarried  as soon as they were entered we followed and found them all sitting on the estrado which is a continued seat all round the room close to the wall in a corner of this room was a large table covered with dishes filled with various eatables a large perigordpasty in the middle a couple of roasted turkies on the sides of the pasty with hams fowls game sausages sallads caparonnes a kind of capers as big as filberts etc etc in short this was a cold collation as plentiful as it was elegant  the master of the house with the assistance of some of the guests immediately began to carve whilst the rest of us snatching napkins from a heap lying on another table ran and spread them on the ladies knees then went back for plates knives and forks and then to get such victuals as we were desired to bring stooping or kneeling by them whilst they were eating and amusing them in the best manner we could saying whatever came uppermost with such hilarity and pleasantness that no scene could be more delightful no servant was permitted to wait at this kind of supper the ladies all ate heartily and the greater part of them drank water  this merry meal being ended they went from this room into a much larger the lady of the house preceding as before they were no sooner gone than we fell on the remnants with a cheerfulness no where to be met with but in this country the rule is to have a concert or cards after supper about eleven the company begin to steal away alla spagnola that is without giving the least warning of their going either to the master or mistress of the house  the desire that men and women have here of passing their time in each others company is so very eager that it appears a kind of rage especially to a person who has lived long in england where men of all ranks seem ashamed to hang too long about the fair and where the generality deprive themselves every day of their company during several hours merely for the sake of talking politics or circulating the bottle  many are the methods that both sexes have contrived in order to spend as much of their time as possible together  baretti tells us that every great mans doors are always open and any of his acquaintance may walk up into his chambers to find him it is only necessary to knock at the chamber door ladies will receive even their male visitants in their beds sitting up bolstered with pillars and drinking their chocolate with a small table before them the company sitting round the bed on stools when she wishes to rise she desires them to withdraw and then receives them again at her toilette baretti made a visit of this kind one morning to donna paula a woman of fashion and after she was dressed she asked him to take a ride with her  one of the servants out of livery got into the coach and on seeming surprised was told in french such was the fashion and that no femme comme il faut ever went alone with a gentleman not even with her husband this privileged servant bears the title of page donna paulas kept as close as he could to the corner of the coach not to obstruct our view through the front glass and never failed to cross himself in passing by a cross  upon my enquiry if the ladies of madrid had so far adopted the system of some italian districts as to have cicisbeos under the denomination of cortejos she told me they had so far improved upon that mode as to divide their male friends into three classes called anos estrechos and santos these names being frequently met with in spanish writers it may not be amiss to give some explanation of them  it is the general custom then for a large circle of acquaintance to meet on the last day of the year in the evening to draw the anos all the names of the ladies and gentlemen present whether married or not are written on slips of paper and thrown the gentlemens into one hat and the ladies into another the youngest person in company then draws a gentlemans name with one hand and a ladys with the other the two persons thus drawn are to be anos during the next twelve months that is a ladys ano acquires a kind of right to be oftener in her company than he would otherwise have been he enters her house at any hour dines with her without previous invitation pays her a regular courtship and in short becomes in a manner one of her family  there is no other difference continued donna paula between the anos and the estrechos but that the anos are chosen on the last day of the year and the estrechos on the twelfth night each estrechos name is also drawn with a copla or sequedilla of which there are innumerable composed by our wits for the purpose and bought ready printed estrecho means a close friend as to the santos they are little different from the anos and estrechos they are likewise drawn on christmas eve but instead of coplas or sequedillas we draw them with the names of saints from which circumstance they have their name to the saint that comes out with the ladys name the gentleman drawn with her is to pay particular devotion during that year and so the lady to that which is drawn with the gentlemans name  notwithstanding this custom says donna paula the ladies of madrid make good wives nor is there any place in europe where husbands are more gallant fathers more affectionate and friends more respectful you will see and hear men and women behave and talk to each other very lovingly but scarce ever find a gentleman tete a tete with any of us this is no custom of ours consider our method of living not only our gates but every door in our apartments is open from morning to night all our friends and acquaintances come in and go out without asking leave and our many servants are allowed to enter our rooms as freely as ourselves so that those ladies who intend to carry on an intrigue must alter the usual mode of spanish living which cannot be easily done without incurring censure and making themselves the talk of the town  during the whole of my residence in spain says townsend i never heard of jealousy in a husband nor could i ever learn for certain that such a thing existed yet in the conduct of many ladies whether it proceeds from the remains of delicacy from a sense of propriety or from fear caution circumspection and reserve it is evidently apparent when their husbands are in sight some have address enough to keep the cortejo in concealment and this in spain is attended with no great difficulty because when the ladies go to mass they are so disguised as not to be easily distinguished their dress upon that occasion is peculiar to the country they all put on the basquina or black silk petticoat and the mantilla which serves the double purpose of a cloak and veil so as completely if required to hide the face thus disguised they are at liberty to go when they please but should they be attended by a servant he is to be gained and therefore he becomes little or no restraint besides this every part of the house is so accessible by day and the husband is so completely nobody at home so seldom visible and if visible so perfectly a stranger to those who visit in his family that the lover may easily escape unnoticed  this however will not always satisfy the spanish ladies who being quick of sensibility and remarkable for strong attachment are miserable when their cortejo is out of sight he must be present every moment in the day whether in private or public in health or sickness and must be every where invited to attend them there have been recent examples of women of high fashion who have shut themselves up for months during the absence of their cortejos and this not merely from disgust but to avoid giving offense to them if the lady is at home he is at her side when she walks out she leans upon his arm when she takes her seat at an assembly an empty chair is always left for him and if she joins in the country dances it is commonly with him as every lady dances two minuets at a ball the first is with her cortejo the second with a stranger with the former if she has any vivacity she makes it visible and if she can move with grace it then appears but with the latter she shows not only indifference but disgust and seems to look upon her partner with disdain  as soon as any lady marries she is teazed by numerous competitors for this distinguished favor till she is fixed in her choice when the unsuccessful candidates either retire or submit to become in future what may be called cortejos of the brasier without any pretensions beyond that of setting round the embers to warm themselves in winter  it is reckoned disgraceful to be fickle yet innumerable instances are seen of ladies who change their lovers often in this there is a natural progress for it cannot be imagined that women of superior understanding early in life distinguished for delicacy of sentiment for prudence and for the elevation of their minds should hastily arrive at the extreme where passion triumphs and all regard to decency is lost as for others they soon finish the career it is however humiliating to see some who appear to have been designed by nature to command reverence at last degraded and sunk so low in the opinion of the world as to be never mentioned but with contempt these have changed so often and have been so unfaithful to every engagement that universally despised they end with having no cortejo  though jealousy is seldom if ever to be discovered in a husband this cannot be said in favor of the  connection because both parties are tormented by suspicion this is natural for as there is no other bond between them but the preoui of mutual affection each must tremble at the approach of any one who might interrupt their union hence they are constantly engaged in watching each others looks and for want of confidence renounce in a great measure the charms of social intercourse even in public they seem to think themselves alone abstracted and absorbed attentive only to each other he must not take notice of any other lady and if any gentleman would converse with her in a few minutes she appears confused and filled with fear of having given offense in all probability she has and should she be the first duchess in the kingdom and he only a subaltern in the army she may be treated with personal indignity and we have heard of one who was dragged by the hair about the room but if instead of giving she should happen to have taken the offense even the most delicate will fly like a tygress at his eyes and beat him in the face till he is black and blue it sometimes happens that a lady weary of her first choice her fancy has fixed on some new object and she wishes to change but the former whose vanity is flattered by the connection is not willing to dissolve it in lower life this moment gives occasion to many of those assassinations which abound in spain but in the higher classes among whom the dagger is procribed the first possessor if a man of spirit maintains possession and the lady dare not discard him lest an equal combat should prove fatal to the man of her affections in this contest the husband is out of sight and tells for nothing  in a catholic country with such depravity of morals it may naturally be enquired what becomes of conscience and where is discipline it is well known that all are under obligation to confess at least once a year before they receive the eucharist every one is at liberty to choose his confessor and priest but before he leaves the altar he takes a certificate he has been there and this he delivers to the curate of his own parish under pain of excommunication should he fail to do so when therefore a married woman appears year after year before her confessor to acknowledge that she has been and still continues to be living in adultery how can he grant absolution or how can he be moderate in the penance he enjoins without penance and unless the priest is satisfied that there is contrition with full purpose of amendment there can be no absolution without absolution no participation of the eucharist and in the neglect of this excommunication follows yet from the universal prevalence of this offense we may be certain that there must be some way of evading the rigor of the law nothing is more easy as for the penance it is imposed by those who can have compassion on the frailties of mankind and is therefore scarcely worthy to be mentioned in many instances it is ridiculous were any confessor severe he would have few at his confessional the absolution is commonly a more serious business because the penitent must not only testify contrition but give some token of amendment by obtaining at least for a season from the commission of the crime which is the subject matter of confession the first absolution may easily be obtained but when the offender comes year after year with the same confession if he will obtain absolution he must change his confessor and this practice is not only disgraceful but sometimes ineffectual here then it is needful to adopt some new expedient two naturally present themselves for either some priest destitute of principle may be found who for certain considerations will furnish billets or else which is a prevalent practice at madrid the common prostitutes confessing and receiving the holy sacrament in many churches and collecting a number of billets either sell or give them to their friends and as these carry neither name nor signature they are easily transferred  the principal cortejos in the great cities are the canons of the cathedrals but where the military reside they take their choice and leave the refuse for the church in the country villages the monks bear rule at least within their limits and even in the cities they set up their pretensions as for the parochial clergy one thing is certain that many of them have families and all are involved in the common censure  this universal depravity of morals may be traced to the celibacy of the clergy it is true the example of the court has given a sanction to practices which were before restrained and made that honorable which had been attended with disgrace but the effect must always in some measure have been coeval with its cause nay should we be inclined to blame in the first instance the italians who are said to have brought this practice into spain we should be obliged to trace it up to this mistaken principle that conjugal affection is inconsistent with a due discharge of the ministerial functions  this principle is absurd yet upon it is founded the celibacy of the clergy and from that is necessarily derived the corruption of their morals the purpose of the law is however frustrated for nature is like a rapid river which checked in its progress scorns restraint and when diverted from its proper course either overflows the country or forms new channels for itself what then is gained the parochial clergy and these are the only clergy who should be suffered in a state have their connections and their children but not as they ought in the most honorable way they are disgraced in the eyes of the people who are taught by their example to live in violation of the laws and their children for want of a proper education are fitted only for the vilest offices in the community how different is the picture where marriage is allowed the minister is like the father of his parish and his wife performs the office of a mother both set an example of virtue and in every village teach the peasants how to value their domestic comforts in the street their children commonly a numerous offspring are distinguished by their look of health by their cleanliness and by the decency of their conduct and when sent out into the world they form the most valuable members of society  the play houses in madrid are not much frequented the genius of the people does not assimilate with this sort of amusement this will evidently appear by the receipts of two theaters for taking the average between them in december they each produced  0 pounds a night though some evenings less than  0 pounds and even in the christmas week not more than    they have lately introduced the opera though not with any prospect of success because most of the genteel people keep to their own societies except when they attend the balls  few people here discover any love for the sciences though the cabinet of natural history is open to all the world it is little frequented nor are books much read all who are not engaged in business are occupied in their attendance on the ladies with whom nothing of this kind is heard of  when you pay a visit to a lady for wherever there is a lady in a family the visit is to her you neither knock at the door nor ask any questions of the porter but go straight forward to the room where she usually receives her company and there you seldom fail to find her morning noon or night in winter sitting near the brasier surrounded by her friends unless when she is gone out to mass the friends are mostly gentlemen because ladies seldom visit in a familiar way and of the gentlemen thus assembled the cortejo is commonly one though this is not universally the case  the modes of france have reached spain as well as many other countries french cloths and the fashions and colors approved in france are worn under the spanish cloak the veil is no longer worn but by women of the lowest classes for others it serves but to hide the disorder of their dress when they go out on foot except in this case their headdress and whole attire are carefully adjusted to french fashions  their cookery such as they received it from their ancestors is of a nature to please few people they are fond of high seasonings pepper pimento and saffron season or color most of their dishes one of them only has been introduced among strangers and the art of the french kitchen has not disdained to adopt it this is what in spain is called ollapodrida a sort of hotchpotch of every kind of meat cooked together there is however generally a mixture in the spanish cookery participating of the french sort and in some this has wholly supplanted that of spain  the spaniards have phrases of address that would sound odd in all other languages when a gentleman approaches a lady he does not tell her that he is her humble servant her most obedient as is the usual mode of address in england france or italy but that he kisses her feet or lays himself at her feet and when he takes his leave he entreats her to keep him at her feet or under her feet me tenga usted a sus pies or baxo de sus pies the compliment she returns is may you live a thousand years or god go with you or the virgin mary go with you and when she intends respect says beso a usted las manos i e she kisses his hands these civilities may appear a great deal too lofty but general custom takes off much from the literal meaning of complimentary words in all countries  provisions in this town are not so dear as might be expected considering its populousness and its being situated in a province naturally barren a poor family of six or seven people may be supplied with bread meat and wine for as many reals the common fare of the lower class is fresh mutton and salted pork boiled with frenchbeans chickpeas onions and pot herbs on meagre days they live on stock fish and pilchards dressed in various manners but always so much spiced that it is not easy for strangers to accustom themselves to such a burning dish the poorest class of all live almost entirely on the distribution of victuals which many convents make here every day throughout the year here the beggar makes sure of a loaf and a mess of broth enriched often with a slice of meat  with regard to the tables of the rich they are as sumptuous as in any country whatever a grandee of the first class will frequently spend one half of his income for the maintenance of his table the single article of fish has been known to stand some noblemen in full l 000 a year  the two dearest articles in madrid are wood and charcoal a hundred pounds weight of each costs near a crown this is the reason perhaps that there are so few chimnies to be seen in madrid the poor stand basking in the sun in winter wrapped up to their chins in their large capas and the rich sit round a brazier placed in the middle of the room with welllighted charcoal  chap x of the escurial aranjuez ildefonso and other palaces together with the court having taken a very distinct view of the buildings manners and customs of the capital we shall proceed to the royal palaces in the environs and in treating of them will give some account of the court  amongst these the escurial claims our first notice the whole building consists of a palace a church a convent and a burialplace for the sovereigns of spain the etymology of the word escurial is a place full of rocks and the nature of the country agrees perfectly with it this famous monastery is seated in a deep recess at the foot of those high mountains separating the two castilles and protected from every wind except the southeast it looks down upon a wide extended plain with all the neighboring hills covered by thick woods whilst the mountains to the north are bare or covered almost perpetually with snow  it was built by philip ii in obedience to his father charles v to accomplish his vow made after the battle of st quintin which he gained by the intercession of st lorenzo in honor of that saint the architect juan de bautista de toledo took his idea from a gridiron the instrument on which he suffered making the royal residence project by way of handle and representing not only the bars by multiplied divisions but the legs by four high towers placed in the angles of this edifice  in spain the building goes by the name of this saint the choice which philip v made of this steep situation indicates the savage and melancholy character which history gives to that prince this building is quadrangular with the principal front to the west behind which is a mountain the opposite front facing madrid takes the form of the shortened handle of a gridiron reversed it is an amazing structure and has the appearance of a town in the whole it certainly has something awful but does not perfectly correspond with the idea formed of it according to the accounts received its form does not permit the architect to make the most of its vast extent and it is not till we have passed the numerous dormitories and wandered among the courts staircases and galleries that the imagination completes what at first view was only sketched  in the architecture there is nothing magnificent it has rather the serious simplicity of a convent than the splendid elegance of a palace the front to the west has a fine portal formed by large columns of the doric order and on each side two great doors of noble dimensions by this portal we pass to an elegant square court at the bottom of which is a church this principal entrance is never open even for the kings of spain and the princes of the blood but on two solemn occasions when they come the first time to the escurial and when their remains are deposited in the vault which awaits them i could not but imagine says bourgoanne on viewing this entrance but that i perceived the emblems of the gates of life and those of eternity which for the children of kings as well as for the rest of mortals open but once and immediately shut again for ever  the front to the south is entirely destitute of ornament but in the four stories there are nearly  00 windows the whole edifice is built with hewn stone of a species of bastard granite which being become brown with time adds to the austerity of the building the quarry where it was dug in the neighborhood of the escurial is said to have been one motive for the choice of its situation it furnished blocks of such considerable dimension that three stones were sufficient to form the chambranle of the greatest doorways and each step of the principal staircase is composed but of one  at the first sight of the escurial it conveys the idea of a square quarry of stone above ground for it is indeed the largest though not the most elegant building in europe the dimensions are     feet in breadth and the sides     feet in depth twiss from whom we have made this extract says he measured it himself the height is  0 feet  the chief front has    windows in breadth it is said there are  000 windows and  000 doors in the building    0 of these windows are on the outside of the four fronts  when the court is not at the escurial it is but a vast convent inhabited by  00 monks under the inspection of a prior at the arrival of the court the convent is transformed into a palace the monks are banished to the south and west sides and the principal cells become the habitation of the royal family and the nobility and gentry by whom it is accompanied the king himself has his in the narrow space which forms the handle of the gridiron philip ii seems to have wished to make this a retreat where sovereign greatness might retire to hide itself beneath the shade of the altars and become familiarised to its tomb and its successors faithful to this vow of humility still content themselves with the same modest habitation  to connoisseurs in painting no place can afford higher entertainment than the convent of the escurial in every part are seen works of the best masters and even some of their most capital performances it were endless to enumerate particulars suffice it to say that during the residence of a month i never failed a single day visiting the convent and never left it without regret i had peculiar pleasure in finding here so many monuments of titian and a holy family by raphael the latter once in the possession of our charles i but sold by cromwell and purchased by the spanish ambassador for l 000  the statues busts and medallions of the escurial are not in any great number nor very remarkable for their excellence st laurence in the church is good and simple many have taken it for an antique but the only part likely to be so is the head and that is suspected to have belonged to a bacchus  never was an instrument of martyrdom so multiplied so honored and so celebrated as the gridiron they are to be met with in every part of this building there are sculptured gridirons painted gridirons iron gridirons marble gridirons wooden gridirons and stucco gridirons there are gridirons over the doors in the yards in the windows and in the galleries  the escurial as a residence is far from pleasant were it low and sheltered like aranjuez it would be agreeable in spring or were it elevated hanging to the north and covered by thick woods like s ildefonso it might be delightful as a retreat in summer but exposed as it is to the full power of the meridian sun and raised up nearly to regions covered with eternal snow without shelter and destitute of shade it has no local charms at any season of the year the ministers foreign and domestic give good dinners and do every thing to make this solitude supportable but as few ladies can be accommodated here the assemblies want that gaiety which is peculiar to the sex  the pantheon or catacomb where the royal family beginning with charles v are buried is a subterranean vault of beautiful marble highly finished capable of receiving    bodies each in its own recess it is impossible not to feel a kind of religious awe when we descend into this vault in which deceased grandeur seems to struggle against annihilation a few rays of halfextinguished light with difficulty penetrate this cold abode to supply the defect a superb luster pendant from the cupola is lighted up on extraordinary occasions but except in these cases the curious are conducted by a flambeau into the middle of this motionless and silent assembly of sovereigns of both sexes  by the unsteady light of the flambeau we discover opposite the door by which we enter an altar and a crucifix of black marble upon a pedestal of porphyry the rest corresponds to this melancholy magnificence the cases which contain the bodies of the kings and queens are placed on each side of the altar the pantheon is not yet full but the empty cases are open ready to receive their deposits a salutary yet terrible lesson which kings have not refused to receive from the bold designs of an able architect  the ravages of time seconded by the damps have not spared even the marble here we are at once led to reflect on the frailty of man whatever may be his rank and the perishable nature of his works which in his pride he dares consecrate to immortality  the friars of this convent says townsend are   0 and their annual revenue is  000000 of reals or about  0000 pounds arising partly from land and partly from their flock of   000 marino sheep besides  000 kept constantly near home for the consumption of the family  their library consists of  0000 volumes contained in two magnificent apartments each about     english feet in length in the lower room are chiefly printed books yet in it is deposited the famous manuscript of the four gospels written in gold letters a work of the eleventh century over these are collected   00 manuscripts of which     are greek    hebrew and   00 arabic the latter well described in a catalogue lately published by casiri  the library is open every morning and evening during the residence of the court if says bourgoanne you have brought with you to the escurial prejudices against the spaniards in general or against the monks in particular you will certainly lay them aside after having passed a quarter of an hour with the jeronymites of this monastery you will be convinced that under the spanish mantle or even the religious habit more obliging manners more complaisance and more real goodness are concealed than are promised by the elegance of a french dress for the truth of what i here say i may appeal to two danish professors who a few years ago were sent to the escurial to make learned researches and were perhaps better received by the monks notwithstanding the difference of manners language and religion than they would have been at the university of copenhagen they were lodged in the convent and provided with every thing they could wish with the most generous hospitality  all the treasures of the library were open to them and they passed two months in examining and making extracts from the manuscripts which excited their curiosity they returned home with hearts deeply impressed with gratitude and portfolios enriched with the fruits of their laborious researches  the obliging generosity they experienced on this occasion was the more remarkable as the manuscripts entrusted to their inspection are still unknown to the public except by a few extracts only says bourgoanne given of them by a learned monk named cassiri  these consist of two volumes in folio but are far from completing the extensive plan proposed by the monk after his death they were consigned to another of the fathers of the escurial and the learned impatiently expect the result of his labors  the situation of st ildefonso upon the declivity of the mountains separating the two castiles and fronting a vast plain where there is no obstacle to the passage of the north wind renders this abode delightful in summer the mornings and evenings of the hottest days are agreeably cool yet as this palace is upwards of  0 leagues from madrid and half of the road leading to it crosses the broad tops of mountains extremely steep in many places it is much more agreeable to the lovers of the chase and solitude than to others the court of spain comes here annually during the heat of the dog days it arrives about the end of july and returns at the beginning of october  there is nothing magnificent in the palace particularly in its exterior appearance the front on the side of the garden is of the corinthian order and not destitute of elegance it is two stories high contains    windows in view and    rooms in a suite in the middle is the church the gardens are on a slope on the top of which is the great reservoir of water called here el mar i e the sea which supplies the fountains this reservoir is furnished from the torrents which pour down the mountains the great entry is somewhat similar to that of versailles and with a large iron pallisade in the gardens are    fountains the basins are of white marble and the statues which are all excellent and equal to any of the kind even in italy are of lead bronzed and gilt here are two noble cascades of ten falls each these gardens are also ornamented with    very fine marble statues as large as life with    marble vases and  0 leaden vases gilt for the diversions of the younger branches of the royal family there is a mall of   0 paces in length near which is a large labyrinth the gardens were laid out by a frenchman named bouteleux the fountain of fame which is the lowest in situation spouts water to the height of     feet which is exactly that of the weathercock on the top of the church steeple  the upper part of the palace contains many valuable paintings and the lower part antique statues busts and basreliefs all the rooms have their ceilings painted in fresco and decorated with large lookingglasses made here the floors are all of chequered marble and the tables of the finest spanish marbles of various sorts the windows which reach from the ceiling to the floor consist of large plates of glass set in lead gilt  it is singular that the castle and magnificent gardens of st ildefonso should have cost about   000000 of piastres or near   00000 sterling precisely the sum in which philip died indebted this enormous expense will appear credible when it is known that the situation of the royal palace was at the beginning of this century the sloping top of a pile of rocks that it was necessary to dig and hew out the stones and in several places to level the rocks to cut out of its sides a passage for a hundred different canals to carry vegetative earth to every place in which it was intended to substitute cultivation for sterility and to work a mine to clear a passage to the roots of the numerous trees which are there planted all these efforts were crowned with success in the orchards kitchen gardens and pastures there are but few flowers espaliers or plants which do not thrive but the trees naturally of a lofty growth and which consequently must strike their roots deep in the earth already prove the insufficiency of art when attempting to struggle against nature many of them languish with withered trunks and with difficulty keep life in their almost naked branches every year it is necessary to call in the aid of gunpowder to make new beds for those which are to supply their place and none of them are covered with that tufted foliage which belongs only to those that grow in a natural soil in a word there are in the groves of st ildefonso marble statues basins cascades limpid waters verdure and delightful prospects in short every thing but that which would be more charming than all the rest thick shades  at the distance of a quarter of a league from this royal mansion runs a little river the eresma made for the innocent pleasures of the sovereign the banks have on each side a causeway or when the ground requires them there are stone or sod steps it is enclosed between two piles of rocks grouped in the most romantic manner its limpid waters sometimes run tumultuously over lesser rocks in the bed of the river or precipitate themselves by natural cascades sometimes form small basins serving as asylums to the trout where the king occasionally fishes readers if ever you should reside for some time at st ildefonso and find yourself wearied with the dull magnificence on the bank of this river is one of the finest english gardens nature ever formed  the court of spain goes once a year to alarm the naiades of this stream by the noise of a general deerhunting the rendezvous is on the banks of this little river about a league from st ildefonso some days previous to the arrival of the court a number of peasants are sent to the neighboring woods and hills to drive before them the deer with which the country plentifully abounds the prescribed limits are by degrees narrowed until the time fixed for rousing the game the sport then becomes excellent the deer run in small herds on every side seemingly perceiving the danger into which they are driven after which they face about and endeavor to brave the running fire of the musquetry threatening them in the rear but obeying the impulses of fear and failing in the attempt they pass in closer herds through the fatal defile where the king and royal family placed in ambuscade wait their arrival their agility now becomes their last resource and saves the greater number out of   or  000 and sometimes more which thus pass in review about  00 fall some remain dead on the spot others carry away with them the mortal wound and fly to conceal their agony in the thickets their bodies whilst yet in palpitation are brought and arranged upon the field of battle these are numbered with a cruel satisfaction for which a philosopher would reproach himself but which it is agreed to pardon in hunters the whole court the ambassadors and foreign ministers commonly take part in this amusement which is repeated toward the end of every visit to the escurial  the glass manufacture is here carried to a degree of perfection unknown in england the largest mirrors are made in a brass frame     inches long    wide and six deep weighing near nine tons these are designed wholly for the royal palaces and for presents from the king yet made for such purposes only it proves a devouring monster in a country where provisions are dear fuel scarce and carriage exceedingly expensive about   0 men are employed the king is said to make no great profit by it however it is a very material point to be able to supply his subjects with a good commodity and to keep in the country a large sum of money that formerly went out annually to purchase it from strangers to provide fuel for the fires they have put the pinewoods under proper regulations and stated falls    mule loads of firwood are consumed every day and four loads cost the king including all the expenses of cutting and bringing down from the mountains about  0 reals  the palace of aranjuez is    miles from madrid the road to it is one of the finest in europe it crosses the famous bridge of toledo built by philip ii and which it has been said only wanted a river when the manzanares is very low which is most commonly the case this little river is fordable and the bridge avoided which cuts off a quarter of a league in crossing the fine part of the environs of madrid called las delicias a walk consisting of two divergent allies which terminate at the canal of manzanares on the other side begins the fine road to aranjuez after having traveled six leagues on a level road surrounded with olive trees we descend by a spiral declivity to the charming valley of aranjuez  on arriving in this valley the dry and naked plains of castille disappear and are succeeded by a richer soil when we travel in the shade surrounded by cascades and the murmurs of rivulets the meadows are enamelled with flowers and the pastures display the most lively and variegated colors vegetation appears in all its richness and proclaims a neighboring river which with its beneficent waters fertilizes and vivifies the landscape the tagus entering the valley at the east end runs and meanders for two leagues and after having reflected the images of the most beautiful plantations joins the xamara  the learned find in this junction the etymology of the name of aranjuez they tell us the ancients erected temples at the confluence of rivers that there was one in honor of jupiter at that of the tagus and xarama and that thence is derived the name of aram jovis altar of jupiter whence by corruption aranjuez ancient however as may be the name the embellishments are modern  the first spanish monarch who resided there for any considerable length of time was charles v he began to build the palace his successors have inhabited and to which ferdinand vi and charles iii have each added a wing in this new form it is still less a royal mansion than a very agreeable country house most delightfully situated where art has done nothing more than make an advantageous use of the advances of nature the tagus which runs in a right line to the eastern front glides by the pasture and forms almost under the windows an artificial cascade  a small arm of the river escapes from the cascade and so closely washes the walls of the palace that from his terrace the monarch may take the diversion of fishing this arm afterward rejoins the river and thus forms a pleasant island which is a vast garden of an irregular form where shade and fresh air and the warbling of birds are constantly found  art seems to have left to nature the care of embellishing aranjuez the palaces and other edifices are of a pleasing form but without magnificence the furniture of the apartments is less rich than elegant the paintings are not numerous there are only some portraits of the princes of the houses of bourbon and braganza and a few neapolitan paintings in which nature seems imitated with more truth than elegance  it would require too much time to conduct the reader through all the fine plantations of aranjuez from the village of which runs a covered portico continued to the buildings adjoining to the palace  near aranjuez are stables of breeding mares belonging to the king of spain in which the breed of spanish horses is still preserved in all its ancient beauty the building has for inscription vento gravidas ex prole putaris i e from their swiftness you would imagine them engendered by the winds these animals more especially contribute to the embellishment of aranjuez they there peculiarly display all the beauty of their motions and their speed  formerly the call de la reyna was the course where horses from barbary displayed their swiftness a new kind of amusement is now substituted there called the parejas which i had the satisfaction of viewing says townsend previous to my departure from aranjuez the prince of asturias with his two brothers attended by    of the first nobility all in the ancient spanish dress and mounted on highbred andalusian horses performed a variety of evolutions to the sound of trumpets and frenchhorns forming four squadrons distinguished from each other by the color of their dresses which were red blue yellow and green they executed this figuredance with great exactness and made an elegant appearance when the weather is fine the parejantes for so the figurans of this equestrian country dance are called walk in their dresses in the gardens of the palace and join the spectators the subjects of philip ii and charles v and those of charles iv seem then to be united imagination approaches these two reigns and compares with pleasure the age of splendor in spain with that of its regeneration  the residence of aranjuez favors all the innocent diversions of the country walks are no where more varied whether with a book in your hand you wander in the shrubberies or pass through the long allies on horseback or in a carriage you may securely indulge in meditation and reverie  the corpse diplomatique seem to enjoy themselves more in this retreat than at the other sitios they live near together give good dinners have frequent balls and from day to day they have one continued round of pleasant amusement  in this sequestered spot we meet with none but men of the most polished manners well informed of every thing that is passing in the world and with the most accomplished women all cheerful gay and lively the refinements of a select society like this says townsend were so powerfully attractive that i laid by my pen i closed my books and from morning to night had agreeable engagements  the motions of the court are mostly uniform from day to day whilst at aranjuez the king commonly amuses himself with fishing till noon when he returns to dine like every other branch of the royal family in public after dinner follows a short conversation with the foreign ministers which being finished they retire to the garden and he accompanied by the prince leaving the palace between three and four in the afternoon goes  0 or  0 miles to shoot following his sport as long as he can see  the old fashioned courtiers dine at half after one immediately on returning from the palace but the more modern at two oclock and the foreign ministers between that and three  in the evening after the siesta the princesses attended by their guards the grandees and some of the foreign ministers enter their coaches and move slowly on saluting each other as often as they pass  by the side of the long extended mall the call de la reyna between madrid and aranguez is a fine avenue well filled with company in which the princesses occasionally walk if they are on foot the whole company follows in their train when passing in their carriages all stand still to make their bow and the cloak which was flung loosely back or held up or tucked under the arm and the flap which was cast negligently over the left shoulder is let fall and hangs like the undertakers cloak when walking at a funeral it is pleasing to see the genteel young spaniard in his capa which he throws into a thousand graceful forms each remarkable for its peculiar ease and elegance such as no foreigner can imitate but when he meets a person of superior rank or when he goes into a church ease and elegance are banished by decorum and this capa so much to be admired degenerates into the stiffness and formality of a cloak  the spanish ladies discover the same taste in wearing the mantilla a kind of muslin shawl covering the head and shoulders and serving the various purposes of the hood the cloak and the veil no foreigner can ever attain their ease or elegance in this simple dress in the spanish women the mantilla appears to have no weight lighter than air it seems to supply the place of wings  one evening says townsend when this public walk was thronged with ladies many of whom were richly dressed on the tinkling of a little bell at a distance scarce to be heard in one moment all were upon their knees upon asking a lady what was the matter she told me his majesty was passing had i enquired of a frenchman he would have said cest le bon dieu qui pass her looks pointed me to the spot where two ladies of high fashion had quitted their carriage to the host which the priests were carrying to some dying christian had it been the rainy season they must have done the same and had the public walk been even wet and dirty none would have been excused from kneeling  at a ball at this place says the above writer i had the happiness to see madame mello dance a volero her motions were so graceful that whilst she was dancing she appeared to be the most beautiful woman in the room but she had no sooner retired to her seat than the delusion vanished  this dance bears some resemblance to the fandango at least in sprightliness and elegance but then it is more correct than that favorite yet a most lascivious pantomime the fandango itself is banished from genteel assemblies and justly so as danced by the vulgar it is most disgusting as refined in higher life covered with a most elegant yet transparent veil it ceases to disgust and from that very circumstance excites those passions in the youthful breast which wisdom finds it difficult to curb this dance must certainly come to them by tradition from the moors the music of it has such a powerful effect on young and old that all are prepared for motion the instant that the instruments are heard and from what i have seen says townsend i could almost persuade myself that were it suddenly introduced into a church or a court of judicature priests and people judges and criminals the gravest and the gay would forget all distinctions and begin to dance  chap xi of toledo and its environs the origin of toledo is uncertain according to sylva in his enquiry concerning the manner in which spain was peopled some jews established themselves in the place where toledo now stands   0 years before christ and called the city they founded toledath which in their language signifies mother of the people this origin is equally noble and doubtful two hundred and twentythree years before the christian era hannibal added toledo with castille to the empire of carthage from thence it passed under the dominion of the romans and in     eurico the seventh sovereign of the goths took possession of this city in that line the scepter continued more than   0 years when the moors entered spain and in three years overran the whole kingdom and toledo submitted to its fate a d     from this time to the final expulsion of the moors in  0   toledo was the object for which most blood was shed alphonso vi who rescued this city styled himself emperor of toledo whence it took and has preserved the title of royal and imperial  this famous city once the seat of empire where the arts and sciences  where trade and manufactures flourished  is now brought to ruin and decay and is kept in existence only by the church this city which contained  00000 souls is now reduced to less than   000 the citizens are fled the monks remain  the situation of toledo is remarkable the tagus passing between two granite mountains and almost surrounding one of these forms a peninsula on which the city stands appearing at a distance like a cone  toledo is    leagues from madrid solitary streets houses in ruins and the almost total absence of industry and affluence but ill agree with the idea formed of a city first in rank of the cortes of the kingdom of castille which for a long series of years passed for its capital and of which all the monuments prove its ancient splendor madrid which in the latter centuries increased its population at the expense of the neighboring cities laid toledo in particular under heavy contributions the aspect of the ruins and barrenness of the environs concur in giving it an appearance of wretchedness in some respects however contradicted when we enter their houses which are clean and neat in the extreme  a pleasing sight and seldom to be seen where poverty resides the inhabitants of toledo are not in this respect much inferior to the dutch and the pains the latter take about their walls their windows and their furniture are employed by the former in defending their habitations from the sun and procuring coolness even in the dog days in visiting several of these little mansions says bourgoanne i thought myself transported into the palace of sleep nothing disturbed the calm of their peaceful inhabitants at three in the afternoon the windows and lattices shut the floors moistened by frequent sprinklings and large sheets spread over their courts all concurred to make us forget the heat of the climate and the hour of the day  the industry of the inhabitants was not long since confined to these effeminate inventions within a few years they have shaken off that stupor to which they seemed condemned their prelate declared open war against indolence and wretchedness his immense alms above l 000 sterling annually were unequal to the beneficence of his intentions he therefore fitted up the alcazar a palace which had been the residence of the gothic kings and afterward that of charles v and converted it into an hospicio or general workhouse for the poor this palace had been suffered to decay till some lovers of the arts mourning over the ruins of this once stately pile made representations to the king and urged him to repair it this at the expense of l 0000 was undertaken by the archbishop and restored to its pristine grandeur all the magnificent apartments are now occupied with spinningwheels and looms and instead of princes are filled with beggars in these they work and in the underground story which had been the stables they have their dormitory  this palace was almost rebuilt by charles v it is situated on a steep hill and commands a very fine prospect it has    windows in front and is three stories high the inner court is very grand its colonnade of granite columns of the corinthian order makes a noble appearance the grand staircase is of very fine architecture the chapel is lofty and narrow which renders it very convenient to attend divine service there being a balcony in each story of the house leading into it the stables which are underground are capable of containing  000 horses the attic story is one open gallery for playing in above   0 in length in the middle stories are several large halls one of them has a very remarkable echo to be equalled by none except that of the simonetti palace near milan  the good archbishop here feeds  00 persons employed in the silk manufactory but unfortunately with the best intentions he has completed the ruin of the city for by his weight of capital he has raised the price of labor and of the raw materials whilst by carrying a greater quantity of goods to the common market he has sunk the price of the commodity so much that the manufacturers who employed from  0 to  0 workmen now employ only two or three and many who were in affluence are now reduced to penury  these people are so far from earning their own maintenance that over and above the produce of their labor they require  0000 ducats a year for their support if we reckon the ducat at   s   d we shall find the sum amounts to l   0 and a fraction for each pauper which alone without the assistance of their work should suffice for two of them of these  0000 ducats the archbishop gives  0000 to the church and the church supplies the rest  from the universal experience of mankind says townsend i may venture to assert that if the most able silk manufacturer in europe who in the way of his profession has acquired wealth were to feed to clothe and to employ  00 people upon the same terms either with these in the alcazar or with those who belong to similar establishments in england france or spain he would soon be reduced to poverty for health for comfort for profit for population let every family occupy a separate cottage and learn to live on the produce of its industry from not having a right understanding on this subject benevolence in england france and spain must sigh and say when i would do good evil is present with me such establishments increase the evils they mean to remedy and aggravate the distress they were intended to relieve  the cathedral is one of the most noble sacred edifices in europe its foundation is dated as far back as the end of the sixth century during  00 years it was in possession of the moors and profaned by the mohammedan worship the building itself the carving the pictures and the treasures it contains all attract and rivet the attention this magnificent church is  0  feet long and  0  feet wide it contains five aisles and the highest of these is   0 feet the choir is covered with carvings representing the conquest of granada executed in a most superior style the eye is never weary of examining these monuments of consummate skill among the pictures are the works of the best masters in the library they have near  00 manuscripts  the treasures of this cathedral says townsend struck me with astonishment la custodia an elegant silver model of the cathedral weighs   000 ounces and took    ounces of pure gold for gilding it contains a multitude of pillars and more than  00 little images of exquisite workmanship in the center of this edifice is placed a shrine of massive gold weighing  0 pounds another occasionally supplying the place of this contains a statue of the infant of jesus made of pure gold and adorned with  00 precious stones in four separate closets are four large silver images standing on globes of silver each two feet diameter representing europe asia africa and america with their several emblems the grand silver throne on which is placed the virgin wearing a crown and adorned with a profusion of the most costly gems weighs  0 arrobas which at    pounds the arroba is equal to    0 pounds in the chapel of the virgin is an altar covered with gold and silver  it is evident that this profusion of wealth has arisen from the pious donations of the spanish princes out of the immense treasures obtained from their gold and silver mines on the first discovery of america the value of these donations may be ascertained with ease but no pen can estimate no figures calculate no imagination conceive what would have been their value if instead of being thus buried and as far as relates to any useful purpose lost it had been employed in making easy communications through the kingdom by roads and canals or in the improvement of the soil by draining by planting and by watering or in the establishment by premiums and by loans of useful manufactures suited to the genius of the people and to the nature of the country if that overflowing wealth had been diverted into profitable channels what might spain have been dicite pontifices in sancto quid facit aurum what has gold to do in the sanctuary we may venture to say that if the gold and silver of america instead of being buried in the churches or which is worse instead of pampering the pride the prodigality and the unprofitable luxury of the great or which is worst of all instead of being idly squandered in useless and almost endless wars if all this gold and silver had been devoted to ceres spain would have been her most favorite residence and the whole peninsula one continued garden  the revenues of the cathedral is perhaps not to be equalled by any church in europe the archbishop has  000000 of reals a year which makes about l 0000 sterling a revenue fit for a sovereign prince besides the archbishop there are  0 canons  0 prebendiaries and  0 chaplains the whole body of ecclesiastics belonging to this cathedral are  00 all well provided for the pope and the king of spain are always canons of this cathedral  there is an asylum open at toledo to suffering humanity viz an hospital for the insane there are two principal ones in spain one at saragossa and the other at toledo i went several times to the latter says bourgoanne and was always surprised at the cleanliness and regularity which i constantly found there  the sight of such a place has always something in it afflicting to humanity even when viewed with the curious eye of philosophy but i confess i never felt the sentiment of those who say they are humbled at the sight of this degradation of human reason we never feel humiliation except we can make comparisons to our own disadvantage what class in the creation is better treated than the human species if any other be so is our situation in life such as to make us blush before it shame supposes a reciprocal consciousness between the being that feels and that by which it is caused we know not angels beasts are unacquainted with us and insanity being an involuntary defect from which no one is secure in what manner can any individual of the human species feel humiliation at the sight of a madman he himself would not feel it were he capable of reasoning the drunkard and passionate are those that ought to blush they rebel against the reason which would restrain them the madman no longer under its empire is slave of a power which has subjugated him without his consent he is not to be pitied unless when lucid intervals give him knowledge of his situation except in these cases a wretch racked with the gout seems to have greater claim to compassion with these preliminary observations the asylums of humanity despoiled of its most exalted endowment may be entered with greater composure there was but one man raving mad in the hospital of toledo he was a priest who from the wretched bed to which he was chained uttered uninterrupted execrations against the principal personages of the kingdom of spain i beheld in him says bourgoanne only a ferocious beast in a human form whose roarings were articulated by words without blaming or pitying him i fled from his approach his companions were much less frightful i particularly remarked a franciscan monk who had preserved his habit and had wrapped up his head in a wig made of paper his only mania was that of mounting on a stone and thence as from a pulpit delivering scraps of sermons which he mingled with facetious jokes and ended with making capers in      i passed a quarter of an hour among his audience two years afterward i again appeared before him and was not a little astonished at his recollecting me i admired this inexplicable singularity of nature which in so severely treating his intellectual faculties had still preserved to him a happy memory is not this another problem for metaphysics to resolve  near this city is to be seen part of an aqueduct erected to convey on a level with the alcazar the water from a spring seven or eight leagues from toledo this is one of those works equally useful and magnificent by which the romans have marked their residence in several places in spain nor is this the only roman monument of which the remains are found in the environs of toledo near a convent of the minimes are the ruins of a circus and not far from thence may be discerned the traces of an old roman road  thus the romans the arabians the goths and the spaniards of the time of charles v by turns embellished and improved toledo we cannot say so much for the present race houses out of repair fine edifices going to ruin few or no manufactures a population considerably reduced and the most barren environs are all that now offer themselves to the sight of the travelers drawn thither by the reputation of that famous city under the late reign some successful efforts were made to recover it from the universal decay into which it is fallen we have seen that the archbishop has rebuilt part of the alcazar and established there some manufactures of silk the blades of toledo were formerly famous for their temper and solidity charles iii erected a very spacious edifice for making them and the experiments already made seem to promise that the modern citizens of toledo will not in this respect be long inferior to their predecessors  twiss says that all the sword hanger and daggerblades for the spanish army are made in this city but that they are far from being so well tempered as in former times a true old toledo swordblade sells even in spain for six or seven guineas and can be purchased only by chance there are daggers that have been made here which will strike through a crownpiece the steel is still excellent says townsend and so perfectly tempered that at thrusting at a target the swords will bend like whalebone and yet cut through a helmet without turning their edge  peyron adds that the secret of hardening them has again been recovered and that experiments have been made with blades lately fabricated here which seem to justify this assertion when one of these has undergone the operation of tempering if it is in the least notched by striking with it several blows on an iron headpiece it is rejected all swordblades made for the soldiers have the kings name engraven on one side and some device on the other such as no me saques sin ragon na me embaines sin honor draw me not without reason sheath me not without honor  virgil says at chalybes nudi ferrum etc and naked spaniards temper steel for war it is likewise remarked by diodorus siculas that the celtiberians gave such temper to their steel that no helmet could resist their stroke  the inhabitants of this city would scarce pardon us were we to pass over in silence their cigarrales these are little country houses resembling those in the environs of marseilles except that they are less ornamented and not so numerous upon the banks of the saone the loire or the thames these cigarrales would dishonor the country in the barren part of castille they are delightful retreats offering in the heat of the dog days coolness and repose amidst the shade of orchards but it is impossible to arrive at them except by crossing parched and unshaded meadows or climing steep and rugged precipices they are however the garden of eden to the inhabitants of toledo  chap xii of the province of old castille the name of old castille was given to this province as being recovered from the moors sooner than new castille on the south it is bounded by new castille on the west by leon on the north by asturia and biscay and on the east by navarre and arragon its figure is irregular and consequently its dimensions very different its greatest length from valladolid to tarracona is about     english miles and its greatest breadth about   0 the principal rivers are the duoro and the ebro the sources of all the rivers are in this province which is mountainous and not near so fertile as new castille the most fruitful part is a tract lying north near medina the wine produced here is excellent and its plains are covered with cattle particularly sheep the wool of which is the best in all spain it was formerly only a country subject to the kings of leon but in  0   was erected into a kingdom the most remarkable cities which claim the attention of travelers are burgos its ancient capital valladolid and segovia of these we shall treat in their turn  burgos the capital of old castille is very agreeably situated the greatest part of it is on the right of the arlaneon over which there are three bridges this river describes the arch of a circle round burgos and on the other side is a hill upon which there still remains some ruins of an old fort the arlaneon embellishes and fertilises all the environs it renders flourishing the plantations which serve as public walks waters the verdant meadows and washes the walls of two remarkable edifices situated below the city the first is a convent of nuns the abbess of which has considerable privileges and is the best endowed in spain the other is the royal hospital remarkable for the extreme cleanliness preserved in it and the healthiness of its situation the most polished nations might take example from the spaniards with respect to their charitable foundations  there is nothing remarkable in burgos except its cathedral one of the most magnificent and best preserved of the ancient gothic edifices now existing in europe its form is exactly the same as that of york minster which may be said to be the criterion according to which the beauties and defects of every gothic church are to be estimated we are struck says swinburne with the resemblance between these two buildings both were embellished with a profusion of statues most of those at york were destroyed in the first emotions of iconoclastic zeal those of burgos are still in full possession of the homages of the country and consequently entire the foliagework arches pillar and battlements are executed in the most elaborate and finished manner of that style which has usually been called gothic of late this appellation has been exploded and that of arabic substituted for it  i confess says swinburne i see some reason to doubt of the propriety of this second epithet the churches of our ancestors shoot up into spires towers pinnacles sillagreework and no such thing as a cupola seems ever to have been attempted the mosques and other buildings of the arabians are rounded into domes and coved roofs with now and then a slender square minaret terminating in a ball or pineapple the arabic walls shine with painted tiles mosaics and stucco none of which ever appear in our ancient edifices  from all these differential marks there is reason to suspect that our old structures have been new named and mahometanised without sufficient proof of their arabic origin at the same time it must be acknowledged that it is difficult to find them a more satisfactory and genuine pedigree  the best age of that style of construction began in england in the reign of henry iii for till then we built in the clumsy manner called saxon destitute of every recommendation but solidity the new taste came in all probability from france introduced by some provencals that followed the queen if we suppose it imported into that kingdom by those that returned from the crusades we must of course set it down as an eastern invention the question is what part of the east it came from and whether it was the same as that employed by the arabians if there were clear proofs of its being a branch of the arabic architecture it would still appear extraordinary that its very first introduction into christendom should be attended with so great a variation from the models it was meant to imitate and that any prince or learned priest that thought it worthy of being employed in his country should set about new fashioning it in all its points  some persons have suspected it to have been the manner practiced by the eastern christians and not adopted by the arabs who might disdain to have any thing similar in their places of worship with those of a conquered people others have been of opinion that it comes originally from persia or further east and some again maintain it to be an european invention or at least a barbarous mode of building brought by some great genius to the elegant proportion we behold in our cathedrals  the civdad of valladolid anciently called pindia is a large beautiful and populous city situated in a spacious and delightful plain watered by the pisuerga it is one of the most stately cities in spain having long broad fine streets with large and lofty houses splendid palaces spacious and elegant squares piazzas and fountains  0 convents six hospitals for the sick for infants and for lunatics and  0000 inhabitants  the university has more than  000 students in the year      this seminary was instituted and a d      to      there entered and were matriculated  000 students  the kings palace rather elegant than grand is still preserved but all the palaces of the great nobility are going to decay  in the royal palace philips ii and iii were born and here charles v received the news that his victorious troops had taken rome and made the pope his prisoner and from hence he ordered prayers to be offered up in all the churches of spain for the deliverance of the sovereign pontiff in this city his successors likewise kept their court till philip iv removed it to madrid  as we have mentioned charles v we shall add a short quotation from the abbe de la port  he says on visiting the monastery of st just at no great distance he was shown by one of the monks the place where that emperor had lodged there said he sneeringly is the melancholy solitude where that monarch become imbecile and devout passed his days in winding up clocks in teazing the friars in giving himself the discipline in daubing the walls of his cell with scraps on predestination and grace in stunning himself with reflecting on the abandonment of his crown and in repenting there he performed the farce of his own burial put himself in a coffin sung for himself the de profundis and showed all the follies of a distempered brain  the large field called el campo grande is within the walls and round it are    churches on this spot many thousands of heretics have been burnt alive by order of the inquisition but none of these execrable executions have taken place for many years  all the public walks are ornamented with trees some of which are delightfully situated on the banks of the pisguera the country round this city is a perfect garden watered by the norias it produces white wine of a good quality excellent madder some silk and a few olives  valladolid is not wholly without manufactures some stuffs and coarse cloths are made there from the wool of the sheep kept in the neighborhood there are also gold and silversmiths and one street is entirely inhabited by jewellers  this city though fallen from its ancient splendour on the finishing of the projected canal may recover it again  this canal begins at segovia    leagues north of madrid from segovia quitting the eresma it crosses the pisuerga near valladolid and proceeds to reinosa at reinosa is the communication with the canal of arragon which unites the mediterranean to the bay of biscay  they have already completed  0 leagues of it which has cost near l 00000 which is about l     per mile it is nine feet deep  0 feet wide at bottom and    at top and when perfected which may be in less than  0 years the world will perhaps have nothing of the kind to be compared with it either in point of workmanship extent or utility  segovia is a city of great antiquity and still considerable it stands high between two hills being large populous and handsome having excellent manufactures of cloth and paper and exporting also a very fine sort of wool in segovia the first object to attract the eye is the aqueduct a most amazing fabric of antiquity carried from one mountain to another to the length of  000 paces and supported by two rows of    lofty arches it passes through the suburbs and conveys water to the whole city  antiquaries have not agreed upon the time of its erection the romans were certainly the builders of it but no inscription remains sufficiently legible to lead to the knowledge of the precise period of their empire in which it was constructed it is likely to remain in its present state as long as segovia exists for the situation of that city on a dry rock renders this supply indispensibly necessary  the principal buildings in this city are the cathedral and the alcazar  the cathedral is one of the handsomest churches in spain in the latest gothic manner the inside is majestic and remarkably clear of the embarassments of altars and chapels so common throughout the kingdom  the alcazar or palace formerly the residence of the gothic kings stands in one of the finest positions possible on a rock rising above the open country a very pretty river washes the foot of the precipice and the city lies admirably well on the brow of the hill the declivity is woody and the banks charmingly rural the snowy mountains and dark forests of st ildefonso compose an awful background to the picture toward the town there is a large court before the great tower which having been the prison of gil blas is so well described by le sage that the subject requires no farther explanation the rest of the buildings form an antique palace which has seldom been inhabited by any but prisoners since the reign of ferdinand and isabella who were much attached to this situation there are some magnificent halls in it with much gilding in the ceilings in a semibarbarous taste all the kings of spain are seated in state along the cornice of the great saloon the royal apartments are now occupied by a college of young gentlemen cadets educated at the kings expense in all the sciences requisite for forming an engineer the grand master of the ordnance resides at segovia which is the head establishment of the spanish artillery  another court of the palace is allotted as a prison to algerine captains of ships their crews work in the arsenal of carthagena most of their time is spent in conversation walking up and down a long gallery smoking and playing at chess except when they go down at stated hours to fetch water for their own use confinement apart their lives pass in case and tranquillity  the mint is situated at the bottom of the city upon the small river eresma the whole machinery for coining is moved by waterwheels by means of which the metal is weighed cut beaten stamped and milled as it were in a moment this is the most ancient of the three mints in spain the other two are at seville and madrid  the head attire of the married women of this province has something very singular in its appearance it consists of a black perriwig faced all round with the wool of a black lamb ending behind in two long plaited tresses that reach down to their rumps previous to their nuptials they are obliged to make up this elegant kind of helmet which renders their natural ugliness still more horrible they wear large clumsy shoes almost as bad as the french sabot a brown gown thrown back and tied behind a blue and white apron and a large flowing white veil fastened with blue ribbands the montero caps of the men are all faced with red or blue  at one place where we stopped says swinburne the only thing we remarked was a cows tail in which the hostess stuck combs this was the first instance we had met with of a custom which prevailed in sancho pancas time and was of such service in furnishing the barber with a false beard  in some parts of this province the houses are built with pieces of clay squared and baked in the sun on every steeple in the villages there are two or three storks nests these birds seem to be held here in the same veneration as they are in the low countries  numberless flocks of sheep cover the plains of segovia and produce that excellent wool which makes such an important branch of the commerce of spain the kings were anciently the proprietors of the greatest parts of these flocks they have been successively alienated for state exigengencies philip i was obliged to sell the last   000 sheep which belonged to the crown to defray the expenses of war they are however still the object of the governments particular attention in effect there is a considerable exportation which is used all over europe  the sheepshearing performed in the month of may is an object of considerable magnitude in spain because it is done in great buildings contrived so as to receive flocks of  0  0 and sometimes  0000 sheep the harvest and vintage in corn and wine countries are not seasons of greater festivity it is a time of rejoicing both to the owner and to the workmen the latter are divided into classes each of which has its distinct employment a hundred and twentyfive workmen are necessary to every  0000 sheep each sheep produces four sorts of wool more or less fine according to the part from which it is taken  chap xiii of leon etc we shall now proceed to speak of the remaining provinces on the northern part of this kingdom these are leon biscay navarre asturia and gallicia the last four lie on the seacoast which forms part of the bay of biscay the principal seaport in this bay is bilboa in the province or kingdom of leon is the city of salamanca famous for its university besides these two towns there are few others of any celebrity before however we speak of these cities we shall as we have already done give some general view of each province classing whatever may be interesting under its respective territory  the kingdom of leon is bounded on the north by asturias on the west by gallicia and portugal on the south by estramadura and on the east by old castille its extent from north to south is near  00 miles and from east to west about  00 the soil produces all the necessaries of life particularly the districts of vierzo and ledesma the wine likewise is tolerably good and in this province are mines of turquois all the way from leon the ancient capital of this province to salamanca says townsend the country is so flat and open that the moorish horse when they invaded spain must have met with nothing to impede their progress because in such extensive plains an oppressed people dispirited and disarmed could have little inclination to make resistance and had it not been for a more hardy race inhabiting the mountains of the north the whole peninsula might at this moment have been numbered among the followers of mahomet the principal river is the douro dividing the province into two nearly equal parts and after passing through portugal discharges itself into the sea  leon the capital of the province was built by the romans in the time of the emperor galba and called legio septima germanica from whence the name leon is derived it lies at the end of a large plain bounded by the mountains of the asturias the cathedral is famous not only for its beauty but for having been the burialplace of several saints    kings of spain and one emperor the city was formerly much larger richer and more populous than at present it was the first city of any consequence that was retaken from the moors and the seat of the first christian king of spain  all the churches of this city like those of arragon are crowded with pillars which are nearly hid with preposterous ornaments such as vines cherubs angels and birds covered entirely with gold  this city destitute of commerce is supported by the church beggars are to be seen in every street who are fed by the convents and at the bishops palace here they get their breakfast and here they dine besides food they receive every day at one of the convents the men a farthing and the women and children half as much on this provision they live marry and perpetuate a miserable race an hospicio or general workhouse is nearly finished to receive them but if alms continue to be thus distributed the same number of wretches will in time occupy the place of those who shall be sent into confinement  the surrounding country is bold and beautiful but ill cultivated this city is watered by two little streams which unite below the city these in summer might be called brooks in winter they are torrents  with the rolling stones hurried down from the mountains by the impetuous raging of these torrents on the melting of the snow a great part of the wall is built which forms a valuable collection for the naturalist who wishes without labor to investigate the nature of the country among these are found limestone schist and grit all these prove by their extraneous fossils that the hills from whence they come were in a state of dissolution and covered by the sea  salamanca termed by the spaniards the mother of virtues sciences and arts is situated on little hills and in a plain watered by the river tormes it lies    leagues northwest of madrid it is an extensive rich and populous city abounding in all the necessaries of life  the most beautiful part of this city is the great square built about  0 years ago the houses are of three stories and all of equal height and exact symmetry with iron balconies and a stone ballustrade at the top of them the lower part is arched which forms a piazza all round the square of     feet to each side over some of the arches are medallions with bad busts of the kings of spain and of several eminent men in stone basreliefs among which are those of fernando cortes francis pizarro davila and cid ruy  the piazza is not more to be admired for its beauty in the day than for the protection it affords by night because in this city they have an execrable custom both offensive to the nostrils and destructive to the clothes similar to that for which the inhabitants of the old town in edinburgh have been deservedly reproached  the river tormes has a bridge of    arches over it in this city built by the romans and yet entire there are also the remains of an old roman causeway leading from this city to lerida and from thence to seville there is an inscription to be met with denoting it to have been repaired by the emperor adrian  of all the public edifices the cathedral is the most worthy of attention the foundation of this ancient structure was laid a d      but it was not finished till      the whole is beautiful but the most striking part of this church and of many public buildings in this city is the sculpture which merits admiration not only for the taste therein displayed but for its excellent preservation  the church of the dominicans comes little short of the cathedral in point of sculpture it has a representation of st stephen stoned with a crucifix above it all as large as life and not apparently injured by the weather indeed in both these edifices the carvings are in some measure protected not from a driving rain but from its perpendicular descent because they sink back as much as the thickness of the wall will permit which is at least six feet and are surrounded by mouldings projecting considerably beyond the wall the precaution without doubt was prudent yet some of the ornaments in basrelief preserve their sharpest angles even when exposed to the full force of the destructive elements this circumstance may be readily accounted for when we consider that stone is a grit which when first taken from the quarry is soft but upon being exposed to the air acquires hardness hence it is peculiarly valuable both to the architect and the sculptor and to these properties we may attribute the beautiful monuments of art abounding in salamanca  it would be tedious to describe the convents and public seminaries of this once famous city yet to pass them all in silence would be inexcusable we shall briefly therefore mention such as merit attention  among these may certainly be reckoned the old college here the quadrangle is small yet elegant and the cloister with its    columns one of the prettiest in salamanca the apartments are commodious and those of the regent are in a superior style  the college of the archbishop is built upon a larger scale more light and airy and having four galleries of   0 feet with    columns supported by as many which form the cloister it may be called magnificent  cuenca college is remarkable at present for its neatness and simplicity but the portico when finished will place it among the most elegant buildings of this city  the college of oviedo with the churches of the augustines and the carmelites deserve attention  of all these colleges and convents it were endless to enumerate the treasures and rich jewels designed for the service of the altar whatever is most valuable the product of europe asia africa and america is here collected and the best workmen in every country have exerted all their taste and skill each in his several branch to show the perfection of his art the ornaments and dresses of the priests are both rich and beautiful but the most costly piece of furniture in most convents is the custodia that is the depository of the host or according to the ideas of a catholic the throne of the most high when upon solemn festivals he appears to command the adoration of mankind it is not uncommon to expend  000 ounces of silver upon one of these besides gold and precious stones yet in most of them the workmanship surpasses the value of the materials  in the year  0 0 there was not a single convent in salamanca and in    0 previous to the discovery of america they had only six for men and three for women but now there are    in      they counted   000 virgins at present the persons under vows are happily reduced to       the houses are no more than  000 yet they have    parish churches with    chapels and the clergy including those belonging to the cathedral and those of st mark amount in the whole to   0  in a city where the convents and clergy are so numerous it may be well expected that beggars will abound and agreeable to this idea it is seen that by the ample provision here made for laziness every street swarms with vagabonds not merely with those who are proper objects of compassion but with wretches who if compelled to work would be found abundantly able to maintain themselves there is indeed an hospicio or general workhouse for their reception but as the funds are limited and do not amount to l  00 a year it can support only   0 paupers should however the government be inclined to increase these funds it will make no great difference because the numbers both in the workhouse and the streets will always bear proportion to the food distributed this truth can scarcely be inculcated too often but we shall defer our observations on it till we come to treat of cadiz  among the various implements in the hospicio there is an admirable one for weaving tape both cheap and simple in its construction and so expeditious in its work that a little child weaves near  0 yards and a woman more than   0 in a day  the university of salamanca was founded in the year   00 by alfonso ix this seminary soon rose into importance and became eminent in europe by acquaintance with arabian authors and through them with the greeks its professors translated aricena who took the lead in medicine and averroes who had bestowed much time in studying aristotle but not satisfied with copying from the arabs they labored much themselves and became justly famous in their day for their knowledge in jurisprudence and for the progress in all the sciences then cultivated in europe  the students were formerly reckoned about   000 but they are now much reduced and in      the number of matriculars was not quite  000 in a curious edict of the emperor charles v for the regulation of mendicity we find a clause permitting students to beg provided they have a license from the rector but in the present day they appear to be in a more reputable condition and few if any take advantage of this privilege  the library is spacious and tolerably well furnished with modern books yet the bulk is trash consisting chiefly of scholastic divinity  there is in this university an irish college threescore students are received in it at a time and when they are sent back to ireland the same number from thence are admitted to be like them trained up for the ministry their course of education requires eight years they are expected to come well founded in the languages and of the time allotted to them in spain four years are given up to the study of philosophy the remainder to divinity  the mode of giving lectures is perhaps peculiar to themselves but worthy to be followed in our universities the students have questions proposed for their discussion twice every day and on these they are informed what books to read then supposing the subject to admit of a dispute it is carried on by two of them under the direction of a moderate who gives assistance when it is wanted and guides them to the truth when this mode of proceeding is not admissible the tutors instead of giving formal lectures employ themselves in the examination of their pupils and the business of instruction is thus greatly expedited  the students are dressed in black like priests and have their crowns shorn  the lower class of people wear large hats uncocked some black and some white slit sleeves broad leather belts and sandals made of cords  about two leagues from this city is a forest of ilex stretching east and west near  0 leagues the acorns here are of the kind described by horace as the origin of war among the rude inhabitants of an infant world not austere like those of oak or of the common ilex but sweet and palatable like the chestnut they are food not merely for the swine but for the peasants and yield considerable profits  the accommodation for travelers through this province are very indifferent perhaps some of the worst throughout spain in the villages they are execrable heavy and incessant rain says townsend compelled us to have recourse for shelter to a miserable village between salamanca and avila called malpartido  the posada had only one bed for the use of the whole family and as that was occupied by a lad son to the good woman of the house then dying of a putrid fever we had a most uncomfortable prospect for the night besides the bedchamber they had as usual a kitchen a room of about ten feet square with an elevated hearth in the center of it over which a little opening in the roof afforded a vent for the smoke around the hearth was a wide bench which by day supplied the place of chairs and by night served the purpose of a bed upon this they designed to scatter straw for me leaving my guide to measure his length on the bare boards at the other end of this magnificent apartment a pass however from count campomanes fortunately procured me a lodging in the village having had the curiosity to measure the room of another posada in this province which like most of those in spain served the double purpose of bedchamber and parlour i found it to be twelve feet by ten yet in these contracted limits were contained a bed the tressels for another a chair with two large chests for the kings tobacco for barley linen and all the treasures of the family the kitchen was nearly of the same dimensions yet in this posada were    horses mules and asses with their riders and drivers who all found lodging for the night  no country can suffer more than spain for want of a rich tenantry excepting a few provinces the lands are commonly in administration and hence extensive districts yield only a contemptible revenue to their lord and districts that of about six square leagues that once could boast of more than  00 towns are now reduced to a tenth part of that number  avila is celebrated among the catholics as having been the birthplace of st teresa in this city are two convents one built upon the spot where she was born the other is the one in which she took the veil  the provinces biscay and navarre are bounded to the west by the asturias to the north by the sea which is here called the bay of biscay and to the south by old castille its extent from north to south is about  00 miles and from east to west about   0 the air here is mild and temperate as in the other provinces but the soil uneven and stony biscay which joins the pyrenees seems to be an extensive continuation of these mountains to the borders of castille notwithstanding its being very mountainous few parts of spain or indeed of any part of europe are so well inhabited as this province and navarre houses and cottages may be discerned in great numbers on the highest mountains and in many of the valleys the villages and hamlets are within sight of each other many of the hills produce a light sort of wine partaking of the qualities of champagne and which if transported to england says baretti would be liked equally well it is pleasing in many parts of biscay to see vineyards and corn fields hanging reciprocally over each other on the sloping sides of the mountains for  0 leagues the distance between the bedassoa which divides the frontiers from france and vittoria not a quarter of an hour passes but the traveller discovers some village or hamlet  the tops of all these mountains says swinburne are crowded with forests or covered with pastures the acclivities cultivated as far as their nature will allow and the deep valleys thronged with villages hamlets ironworks orchards and gardens the timber of the mountains and the iron melted in the forges employ a great number of hands and give life and spirit to the whole province the little towns are full of good houses built by those whose industry and enterprises have been rewarded with success these manufactories and undertakings diffuse opulence among the middle class of men and enable them to indulge the patriotic vanity of settling comfortably in their native hamlets  biscay is the country of the ancient cantabri so imperfectly subdued by augustus and so slightly annexed to the roman empire their mountains have in all ages afforded them temptations and opportunities of withdrawing themselves from every yoke that has been attempted to be imposed upon them  besides corn and wine the biscayans raise a great deal of very fine flax the seacoast abounds so with oranges and lemons that they are sold extremely cheap fruit is plentiful throughout the province the upper parts of the mountains being well wooded and every one being at liberty to go and cut down as much timber as he thinks proper but that it may not become scarce they have a custom once a year for all the inhabitants to go into the woods from which they have cut down any timber and then each man plants two young trees which he brings from the nursery in his garden when the trees are all planted they dance jovially round a large cask of wine which after having emptied they separate and return to their respective habitations the person who instituted this custom has certainly been a great benefactor to his country the lostiest and wildest parts of the mountains abound with the best sort of spanish chestnuts  the sea yields plenty of all kinds of fish and at bilboa they have a kind called angullas which are reckoned a most choice dainty this fish is as white as milk and so very small that a person may put two or three dozen of them in his mouth at once the biscayans fry them in oil and squeeze the juice of lemon over them when they eat them they are so plentiful that the poorest people may purchase them boats are easily loaded with them by the fishermen all along the river orduna below bilboa down to the sea which is at the distance of four or five miles  the principal rivers are the bedassoa and the nervio which falls into the sea two miles below bilboa the ancients called this latter river chalybs and its water is excellent for tempering steel the greatest riches in this province lie in the bosom of the earth in the iron mines from which are made large quantities of arms particularly swordblades esteemed the best in europe a great deal of iron is likewise exported in bars here are also mines of lead and other more valuable metals with which and the other productions of the country they carry on a considerable trade with holland france and england  bilboa the capital of the province lies in a plain environed by high mountains this city is pleasantly situated enjoys a good air stands in a fruitful country is well built and carries on a very considerable traffic in iron wool saffron and chestnuts it is said to contain about  0000 inhabitants the merchants here are reputed to be very rich the tide comes close to the town and the harbor is one of the best and most frequented on the northern coasts of spain  there are two other seaports in this province s sebastian and fontarabia which merit the travelers attention the former pleasantly situated at the foot of a mountain on the bay of biscay about four or five leagues to the west of the french frontiers the harbor is large and safe and the town fortified but appears to be a place of less strength than the spaniards imagined having been taken from them after a months siege by the french in      the streets are long and spacious and the houses well built their trade is very flourishing and consists chiefly in iron and steel said to be the finest in europe there is also a great deal of fine wool exported from hence the growth of old castille some spanish men of war lie about a quarter of a league to the eastward of this place at portpassage  fontarabia is the last town in spain on the side of france it is situated on a peninsula in the bay if biscay near the mouth of the river bidassoa which separates the two kingdoms it was formerly looked upon as impregnable by the spaniards but was taken by the french after a short siege in the same year that s sebastian was taken this is the only town honored with the title of a city and the sea of a bishop in this division of the province biscay being divided into three divisions and it is generally considered to be the key of spain on that side of the kingdom  vittoria or victoria the capital of another division of this province is most delightfully situated in a fine valley about    leagues south of bilboa what renders this town very attracting to the eye of a stranger is the trees planted in all the principal streets it is chiefly inhabited by merchants and persons of rank who have been drawn hither by the beauty of the town and its delightful situation it is said to have been built by sancho king of navarre in memory of his victory over the moors of alava from which circumstance it was named victoria  the three provinces of biscay are the asylum of liberty and industry and this is the great cause of their common prosperity in crossing biscay we perceive their presence has given animation to every object nothing can be more delightful than the hills nothing can be more cheerful than the cultivated valleys what a difference says bourgoanne in the aspect of this country and that of the neighboring province i am far from wishing to throw ridicule on the castillians whose virtues i esteem but they are silent and melancholy they bear in their austere and sallow visages the marks of lassitude and poverty the biscayans have a different complexion and quite another air of countenance and character free lively and hospitable they seem to enjoy their happiness and wish to communicate it to those who come among them  these biscayans who are so different in their language and appearance from the castillians are not less so in the constitution of their country their province is considered in many respects as beyond the spanish frontiers except a few restrictions all merchandise enters and is never examined but at the interior limits the province has other privileges of which the people are very jealous but so precarious a possession is liberty that these have recently been more than once attacked the most moderate government suffers with regret the shackles with which liberty confines its authority if the king be in want of a certain number of soldiers or sailors he notifies his wishes to the province and the people find the most easy means of furnishing their contingency the taxes which they pay have the name and form of free gifts the monarch by his minister of finances requires a certain sum the demand is discussed by the states and as it may be imagined is always acquiesced in they then levy the sum upon the different cities and communities there is one advantage derived from this mode of levying the impost being paid from the city grants individuals are not exposed to seizure or constraint it therefore seems in the first point of view that biscay taxes itself and for want of the reality the inhabitants cherish the shadow to which for some years past they have made real sacrifices the free commerce of spanish america might be extended to their ports if the biscayans would allow the necessary duties to be there paid but they look upon customhouse officers as the creatures of despotism and their jealousy rejects the proffered benefits of their sovereign they can therefore make no commercial expedition to america without preparing for it in a neighboring port and the most industrious people of spain the most experienced in navigation and the best situated for such a commerce sacrifice a part of these advantages to that of preserving some small remains of liberty thus before the war which gave independence to british america all the inhabitants of one of the provinces engaged themselves by an oath not to eat lamb in order to increase the growth of wool with the intention of rendering useless the manufactures of the mother country  biscay is remarkable for its roads cultivation and privileges but more particularly for the industry of its inhabitants this is chiefly exercised upon iron the principal production of the province in order to improve this manufacture the biscayans have recourse to foreign correspondence public lectures and traveling at bergara there is a patriotic school in which metallurgy is taught by some able professors they have already sent students into sweden and germany where they have acquired such knowledge in the mines and in the shops of the manufactures as has been very useful to their country the inhabitants separated by their situation language and privileges weak as they are and confined within narrow limits are called by nature and policy to feel the spirit of patriotism and are obedient to the call this noble sentiment produced the school of bergara where the nobility of the country are brought up at the expense of the states and the same spirit of patriotism has lately given new employment to the industry of the biscayans by digging the port of deva  their privileges says swinburne are very extensive and they watch over them with a jealous eye they have no bishops in the province and style the king only lord of biscay in the year      when ferdinand king of castille entered biscay with the bishop of pampeluna in his suite the people rose in a tumultuous manner and represented to his majesty that it was contrary to their laws and constitution to admit a bishop into their province and the king was obliged to send him back they even went so far as to dig up the earth the holy man had trod upon and burnt it  the biscayans are stout brave and choleric to a proverb the best sailors in spain belong to the ports of biscay and its mountains produce a very valuable race of soldiers the men are well built and active like all mountaineers the people of biscay and navarre says baretti are in general as welllimbed as any of the petty nations living on the apennines yet in no part of these mountains are there so many handsome women as in biscay almost every posada here offers at least one beautiful face the sex however of this province have the reputation of being the most arrant coquettes besides my own observations i have been told by biscayans themselves in the jollity of conversation that almost the women will ogle and whisper and smile and flatter and squeeze your hand to draw presents from you if possible without intending to make the least return  many of the biscayan women of the lower class while very young go to service in the neighboring provinces where their neatness and simplicity of their general dress particularly of their headdress renders them distinguishable at the first glance numbers of them are to be met with at bayonne and in the pays de bigorre the necessity that these females are under of learning more than one language is far from impairing their beauty as no new language can be learned without acquiring new ideas and the more ideas a woman has the more agreeable she will be but the biscayans turn all their talents as well natural as acquired to no other vices but coquetry and the more agreeable they know themselves to be the more they expect from every man who covets their acquaintance ever alluring ever kindling hope and for ever disappointing  it is a general custom in the southern provinces of france to employ female servants in the inns as well as in private houses and this draws a great number of young women from biscay into the different parts of gascony and guienne where they are certain of being preferred to the natives the filles gasconnes are in general short and clumsy with broad tawny and unmeaning faces but the filles basquoises or biscayan girls are almost all of a good size and wellshaped with lively black eyes fair complexions and a smartness about them very attracting then the manners of the gasconnes are coarse and vulgar and they do not scruple to throw themselves into the power of every one who will give them the smallest trifle but the basquires are shy and artful and will go no farther than wheedling and cajoling seeking only to scrape together a few hundred livres that they may return to their own country and marry  with respect to the men it is said in spain that they will rather steal than beg not as being remarkable for thieving but that they scorn begging they have a tradition in biscay that one of their kings declared them all hidalgos and this is the reason that they will not degrade themselves by asking alms it is said there are more natives of biscay than of any other province at madrid and that no biscayan goes there who is not certain to find employment this is owing to a prevailing opinion that the biscayans are more active and intelligent than the rest of the spaniards besides like the scotch in england and the savoyards in france they stand by each other and promote the interest of their courtrymen more sedulously than is practiced by the inhabitants of the other provinces in spain in one respect however they differ from the scotch and the savoyards for as soon as they have acquired a little property at madrid they retire to their own dear mountains where they build themselves comfortable habitations and live the remainder of their days in ease and comfort but the savoyards when once settled in france think no more of the western side of mount cenis except they be porters chimneysweepers and marmoteshewers nor is the case much different with the scotch who when they have once got a footing in any other country especially in england will submit to any thing rather than return back to their own country  this continual return of the biscayans to the place of their nativity is the reason that one sees even on the highest mountains so many houses well built with panes of glass to the windows and neat windowshutters painted yellow or green a sight which does not occur in the other provinces of spain  the most singular thing in their dress says swinburne is the coverings of their legs they wrap a piece of coarse gray or black woollen cloth round them and fasten it with many turns of tape it answers precisely to the idea i have of malvolios crossgartering in the twelfthnight the garb of the women who are beautiful as angels tall light and merry is neat and pastoral their hair falls in long plaits down their backs and a veil or handkerchief twisted round in a coquettish manner serves them for a very becoming headdress on sundays they generally wear white tied with rosecoloured knots  their language is called aboriginal being unmixed with either latin french or spanish it is so totally different from the castillian that scarce any of the peasants are to be met who understand one word of spanish  the kingdom of navarre which by way of distinction from lower navarre belonging to the french is called upper navarre borders to the west on old castille and biscay and to the south on arragon to the east it is bounded by arragon and the pyrennees which divide it from the french navarre and also by the same mountains toward the north its extent from north to south is about  0 miles and from east to west is something more than biscayan peasants  0 the name of this province is modern being entirely unknown to the ancients it is watered by three rivers all falling into the ebro here are two main roads leading over the pyrenean mountains into france the one from pampaluna along the valley of batan to bayonne the other that of roncevaux which is the best from pampeluna by the way of taraffa to s jean de port  the greatest part of this province lying among the pyrenean mountains its chief wealth consists in graziery the mountains abound in game of all kinds as boars stags roebucks wildfowls etc the most remarkable of its valleys are roncal or roncevaux where charles the great lost a battle against the spaniards the king of spain receives no revenue from this country all the imposts and duties being by compact to be employed in the services navarre from the year     to      had its peculiar kings of different families but in the last mentioned year was reduced by ferdinand the catholic under the frivolous pretense that its monarch had been declared an enemy to the church and excommunicated by the pope  pampeluna is the town of most note and capital of the province it is situated in a plain near the pyrenees on the river arga about ten leagues to the south of fontarabia this city was formerly called pompeiopolis as having been built by pompey it is a large city surrounded by a wall and defended by two castles one within the city and the other without the fortifications of the city are inconsiderable but the castle without is situated on a high rock and well fortified pampeluna is at present a bishops see and the residence of the viceroy it contains likewise a university founded in   0  what is more remarkable in this spacious town is a spacious square in which the bullfights are held  there are two other towns in this province ollita and taffala in both of which are palaces belonging to the ancient kings of navarre they are handsome towns well fortified and situated in fine valleys the latter contains likewise a university the city of tudala on the river ebro is from its delightful situation the residence of many persons of quality  chap xiv asturias and gallicia the principality of the asturias borders to the west on gallicia to the north on the sea to the east on biscay and to the south on old castille its extent from north to south is about    leagues and from east to west about    it is said to take its name from the river asta or astura the air of this province is much colder than any other part of spain occasioned by its high mountains and northerly situation toward the south it is separated from leon and old castille by high mountains covered with woods so that the country is thinly peopled yet the soil produces a great deal of grain plenty of fruit and excellent wine its horses were of old famous and much sought after on account of their spirit and goodness they are supposed to be the strongest and swiftest in spain this country being naturally defended by high mountains held out for a long time against the romans and was never entirely conquered by the moors  the nobility of this province value themselves on their descent from the old goths and on their blood not being adulterated either with the moors or the jews for after the unfortunate battle which roderic king of the goths fought with the moors near xeres the gothic prince retreated with a considerable number of his nobility into the mountains of asturias and there collected a small army but finding himself unable to face the enemy in the field he betook himself with  000 brave goths retired into a large cave in the mountains of ausena and on the approach of the moors sallied forth and finally routed them this defeat and bold stand made by the goths is to this day so celebrated in spain that all the inhabitants of this mountain are looked upon as true goths and enjoy particular privileges and though they are but peasants and go in great numbers from this mountain into the other provinces of spain to find work yet they disdain to be called by any other title than that of goths both great and small give themselves the appellation of illustre goths or illustres montagnes and amidst their poverty look upon it as ignominious to intermarry with great and rich families of any other race they are likewise so much esteemed that other families frequently give considerable sums to many amongst them but the greatest honor of this district arises from its belonging to the hereditary prince of spain who takes his title from it it is divided into two unequal parts and hence arises the name of the asturias as used in the plural number  oviedo anciently brigetum the capital of all asturia and the only place which bears the name of civdad is seated on a plain in a kind of elevation between the little rivers ove and deva the first of which has given the name of ovetum to the city from whence comes ovedo the town is well built but not considerable either for its trade or its riches its population is estimated at between   and  000 inhabitants the cathedral boasts a vast number of relics which were brought hither from all parts of spain by way of securing them against the moors the houses about the church of s salvador stand on piazzas and make a very handsome appearance but the grand square in the center of the town where all the streets terminate and in which are the colleges composing the university are its principal ornament  this town like most other large cities in spain contains an hospicio or general workhouse  besides this refuge for the poor and for their children the bishop causes money to be distributed every morning at his gates in addition to all this the canons scatter plentifully their alms as they walk the streets and the convents administer daily bread and broth to those who will apply when sick the poor have besides a commodious hospital ready to receive them  notwithstanding all that has been done says townsend beggars clothed in rags and covered with vermin swarm in every street is it not therefore evident they have done too much increasing both the numbers and distresses of the poor by the very means which have been employed to relieve their wants  nothing can exceed the simplicity of manners in this distant province polished nations would be offended at the freedom with which they speak of things which in the more advanced state of society must not even be hinted at yet such language neither gives disgust nor tends to excite the passions on the other hand familiarities such as in other countries would be esteemed innocent are here highly offensive  they wear no paint no powder no curls nor any cap they have nothing but a bit of ribbon bound round the head in this simplicity of dress youth and beauty enjoy their triumph but old women for want of borrowed charms have nothing which can please the eye they meet with attention however from the gentlemen nor do they appear insensible to these attentions  in this province oxen supply the place of horses and consequently beef is cheap no distinction in price is made between the prime and the coarse pieces nor between fat meat and lean because the prices are fixed by the magistrate without respect to quality the consequence is that the meat is never so good as it would be were the market free beef in this province is under threehalfpence mutton something more than twopence per lb and bread is little more than a penny for the pound  the resemblance between the asturias and many parts of england is very striking the aspect of the country is the same as to verdure enclosures live hedges and woods there is a similar mixture of woodlands arable and rich pastures there are the same kind of trees crops fruit and cattle  both suffer by humidity in winter and both enjoy a temperate climate with this difference that with respect to humidity and heat the scale preponderates on the side of the asturias the atmosphere of this province is at times so charged with vapor that for many months together they seldom see the sun this happens generally in the spring months may june and july but then to balance this in august and september they as seldom see a cloud  besides the relaxing humidity of the climate the common food of the inhabitants contributes much to the prevalence of the many diseases which infest this country they eat little flesh they drink little wine their usual diet is india corn with beans peace chestnuts apples pears melons and cucumbers and even their bread made of indian corn has neither barm nor leaven but is unfermented their common drink is water  agues fevers and even pleurisies often terminate here in scabies and this frequently gives place to them returning however when the fever ceases in adults it takes possession of the hands and arms with the legs and thighs covering them with a filthy crust in wet weather the itching becomes more troublesome and toward midnight is insupportable  there are no fewer than  0 hospitals in the asturias for the leprosy it appears in different forms some patients are covered over with a white dry scurf and look like millers in others the skin is almost black full of wrinkles and covered with a loathsome crust others have one leg and thigh enormously swelled and full of ulcers sending forth a most abominable smell some patients instead of the great leg have a most enormous swelling of one hand or else have the features of the face swollen to such a degree as scarce to retain the human form others again have carbuncles big as hazle nuts all over the surface of their body  although subject to such a variety of diseases there are few countries which can produce more examples of longevity many of the inhabitants live to the age of  00 some of them to   0 and others still longer if we consider the temperature of the climate arising from its humidity together with the cooling winds from the atlantic and from the snowy mountains we must naturally expect to find instances of advanced age with the prevalence of chronical complaints and of such diseases as are seldom mortal in warmer and in drier climates nature comes sooner to maturity is subject to more acute diseases and like combustibles when burning with a vivid flame is rapidly consumed  the houses of people of fashion in this country are generally built round a court with corridors something like many of our great old fashioned inns  the groundfloor is generally occupied wholly by servants except one corner which is made use of as a chapel the bedchambers contain some two some three and others four beds for in spain even in respectable families several gentlemen will occupy one chamber  custom reconciles them to this and by the practice of scotland france and spain we may see clearly that other nations can submit to that which is most disgusting to an englishman and we may further observe even in our own cottages that the olfactory nerves may be reduced to such a degree of torpid insensibility as to be happy and contented in the midst of filth and nastiness  the walls are whitelimed and the floors smoothed with the adze but none of them are ever planed nor have the chambers any ceilings to them the beds likewise have no curtains they have large halls in their houses resembling those in our old english mansions and the style of living resembles the old british hospitality the long oak table surrounded by strong oak benches being every day very plentifully covered  agriculture is at a very low ebb in this province nor are the implements made use of for the purposes of agriculture worthy of imitation the cartwheel has no spokes but consists of a wooden ring composed of four quadrants bisected by a plank of from eight to ten inches wide which receives the axletree and being fastened to the wheel turns round with it the farmers not satisfied with the friction arising from a wooden axletree of eight inches diameter revolving without grease six two wooden pins which confine it in its place so near together that they bind hard against it and this they do for the sake of the noise arising from the friction and which is considered as exciting the oxen to labor and thereby precluding the necessity of either speaking to them or pricking them with goads this music which resembles the sound of a postboyss horn is heard from morning to night in every part of the asturias and at a distance is not unpleasant even to a stranger but to the peasant is the neverfailing source of calm enjoyments  the province of gallicia which was formerly a kingdom is bounded on the south by portugal on the north and west by the sea being joined to the east by asturia and leon it receives its name from the ancient gallazi the most powerful and numerous of the several nations who inhabited it its extent from north and south is nearly  0 leagues and almost as many in breadth from east to west this is the most maritime of all the spanish provinces and enjoys accordingly the greatest number of seaports amongst which corunna and ferrol are the most considerable cape finisterre one of its promontories the promontorium artabrum and celticum of the ancients lies toward the west and is wellknown to all navigators the coast enjoys a temperate air but in the inland parts it is somewhat colder and very damp this country is so mountainous as to admit of few levels and the seacoast excepted is but thinly inhabited in respect of the other provinces it has no less than  0 rivers and smaller streams the principal of which is the minho  this province produces little corn but makes up for that deficiency in wine flax and lemons it has also very fine pastures the sea abounds in excellent fish particularly sardines and salmon and a particular kind called bezugos its forests also afford good shiptimber the universal poverty of the inhabitants obliges great number of them to seek a living in the neighboring provinces where they let themselves out to the most servile and laborious employments for this humble industry they are despised by the other spaniards  gallicia was raised to a monarchy in the year  0 0 by ferdinand king of castille and leon and ferdinand the catholic quelled the mutinous temper of the gallicians particularly of the nobility who for a long time had been wanting in due regard to the kings governor this province contains    cities and towns but few of the latter are any ways considerable  st jago de compostella the capital of gallicia is situated in a fine plain surrounded with little rising hills and watered with a great many small streams it lies  0 miles south of corunna and  0 to the east of cape finisterre the town contains about  000 houses it is a rich flourishing city better accommodated with provisions and the luxuries of life than most towns in spain from its vicinity to the sea in this town are to be seen fine piazzas with several monasteries of both sexes and beautiful churches amongst which the cathedral is particularly worthy of notice as in it is kept the pretended body of the apostle james the younger the titular saint and patron of all spain which toward the close of the ninth century they affirm to have been discovered by a divine revelation the rage for pilgrimage is much abated but there are people living who remember when it was the fashion for all young men of spirit both in italy and france before they married to go as pilgrims to st jago and even now it is not uncommon to see some few old men and many companies of young ones come to this place on a pilgrimage from the most distant parts of europe the sea of the archbishop is one of the richest in spain having a revenue of  0000 crowns per annum and the chapter as much more  it was from this city that the military order of st james had its origin in    0 under the reign of ferdinand ii king of leon the knights wear a medal upon which there is a red sword at the buttonhole of their coats this order has    commanderies in the kingdoms of castille and leon which annually produce    000 ducats  about    leagues southeast of compostella lies orense famous for its mineral baths some are only of such a moderate heat that persons may bathe in them and others are so very hot that eggs may be dressed in them but they are all very much resorted to and are said to possess great virtue in the removal of different diseases these baths appear to have been known in the time of the romans and had the appellation of aquae calidae the town is situated at the foot of a mountain on the river minho and what is very remarkable in that part which lies near the mountain the air is extremely cold and the winter of great length whilst the other which lies on the side of the plain enjoys all the pleasures of the spring and the autumnal fruits on account of the springs which warm the air with their exhalations on the outside of one of the gates is a noble arch so very lofty that a man of war might pass under it with all its sails standing the fields in the environs of this town are very rural and well cultivated and among other delicious fruits produce grapes that make most delicious wine  the manners and customs of the inhabitants of this province appear to differ very little from those in the adjoining province which we have already described the inhabitant of gallicio says peyron may be compared to the native of auvergne he quits his country and is employed in the rest of spain much in the same manner as persons of the same class from auvergne and limosin are in france that is in sweeping chimnies cleaning shoes etc  the climate appears likewise to resemble that of the asturias being very humid nor are instances of longevity wanting in this province the curate of the parish of s juan de poyo a d      is said to have administered the sacrament to    persons whose ages together made      the youngest of them being   0 and the oldest     but in villa de fosfinares one juan de outeyro a poor labourer died in the year      aged more than     years  chap xvi kingdoms of murcia and granada having now traversed the provinces on the northern coast of spain we shall proceed to those which lie on the mediterranean beginning first with the kingdom of murcia in which is situated carthagena one of the most considerable of the seaports  this kingdom is the least of those which compose the monarchy of spain it is but    leagues in length and about    in breadth its principal river is the segura which receives its source in new castille and after passing through this province and valencia falls into the mediterranean sea the air is accounted healthy and pure and the country produces wine and corn which are both good but being mountainous not in any great quantity so that its chief commodities are fine fruits such as oranges lemons etc sugar honey silk and grain such as rice peace etc its principal produce appears to be silk the moors when they conquered spain are said to have brought thither the mulberrytree and to have taught the spaniards the manner of cultivating it as also how to prepare and weave the silk the soil of murcia is so favorable to this tree that it more easily grows there than in any other part of spain the little kingdom of murcia is said to contain     00 mulberry trees and to produce annually   0000 lbs of silk  every kind of fruit produced in spain is found in murcia it supplies castille england and france with oranges lemons figs etc the mountains are covered with shrubs reeds and odoriferous as well as medicinal plants the two principal cities of which we mean to speak are murcia and carthagena  murcia several volumes says bourgoanne have been written upon the antiquities of this city in the earliest ages it is said to have been called tadmir that is productive of palm trees but cascalis maintains it never had any other name than that of murcia these disputes are of little consequence its antiquity is sufficiently proved by inscriptions some of which are quoted by appian in his description of spain and the rest still remain in murcia  in its origin murcia was like every other city near carthagena only a small village the latter eclipsed them all till it was conquered by scipio the romans no sooner came to the village of murcia and observed its agreeable situation the natural cascades of the river and the banks covered with myrtle where this shrub still flourishes more than in any other part of spain than they resolved to consecrate it to their venus myrtia who delighted in myrtle waters and fountains they added an a only to the name which was murci  it was in the fields of murcia that scipio returned from his conquest celebrated the obsequies of his father and uncle this celebration consisted in games and combats of gladiators and according to livy it was not slaves who were forced to combat but brave champions who voluntarily entered the lists to give proofs of their valor murcia remained     years under the dominion of the romans  it was then taken dismantled and sacked by the goths who possessed it   0 years the moors in their turn came to besiege it and the inhabitants went out of the city to give them battle the two armies met in a field still called sangorena from the bloody battle that ensued in which the murcians fought with such gallantry that most of them remained dead upon the field in this extremity the governor ordered all the women to be clad in armor and drawn out on the ramparts whilst in the character of an ambassador he went to the moorish general to capitulate the moors believing the city to be full of soldiers granted him very advantageous terms but what was their astonishment when upon entering the gates they found only an army of women at length after     years possession the moors lost it in      and it has ever since remained under the dominion of spain  murcia stands in a plain which from east to west is    leagues and a half in length the segura runs by the side of the city this river is decorated with a fine stone bridge and has a magnificent quay  i was exceedingly struck says townsend with the bridge over the segura magnificent in itself and delightful for the prospect it commands of the river the city the vale and the distant mountains all in the most pleasing points of view  the entrance to murcia is by a strait and spacious avenue well planted and well watered to the right and to the left of which the water in abundance produces the most luxuriant crops  this city is divided into    parishes with a cathedral and contains by the last return to government   000 families there are nine convents for nuns and ten for friars  the principal front of the cathedral is beautiful but overcharged with ornaments the three principal doors are of reddish marble and of the corinthian order they are ornamented with    statues as large as life the arabian sculpture which ornaments the pillars is well executed and in a good taste  the inside of the cathedral is spacious the beauty lightness and elegance of gothic architecture are found throughout  the altar of the cathedral is of massy silver and the steps which lead to it are of the same metal  among the convents that of the cordeliers is the most distinguished it has a good library but badly managed in which are the portraits of many great men who have rendered themselves famous by arms letters and the art of government the moorish palace stood formerly upon the ground on which the canvent of the dominicans is built  murcia is surrounded by public walks which are most delightful this city although considerable and well peopled has not one single inn the only lodging to be had in it is as wretched as those found upon the great roads in spain generally kept by gitanos or gypsies  the environs of murcia exceed any thing of the kind to be met with in spain the soil is a rich loam well watered and the wide expanse appears like a well cultivated garden oranges and lemons olives and mulberries abound and the whole valley swarms with such multitudes of men all active and usefully employed that they resemble bees when collecting honey or returning loaded to the hive being dressed in white they are the more conspicuous they have only a linen waistcoat and short trowsers  carthagena is announced at a distance by villages farms countryhouses and pleasant walks the principal founders of this city were teucer and asdrubal but a large city called contesta from the name of testa king of spain is said to have stood upon the same ground      years before christ teucer came next and began to embellish and fortify this city at length asdrubal finding its situation delightful added to its magnificence and made it the rival of carthage  carthagena remained in the possession of the descendants of asdrubal until the year  0  before christ when it was conquered by publius scipio and caius loelius it was then governed by mago the last carthaginian chief livy tells us that when scipio arrived in spain carthagena was after rome one of the richest cities in the world full of arms and full of soldiers notwithstanding its great resources scipio took it and delivered it up to be pillaged he brought away with him    military banners     gold cups and   000 marks of silver besides vessels of the same metal  0000 measures of wheat and   0000 measures of oats in a word he acquired such immense treasures that the historian says the city itself was the least the romans gained by the expedition ut minimum omnium inter tantas opes bellicas carthago ipsa fuerit  it was after this conquest that scipio set the great example of temperance and generosity so much celebrated in that and the succeeding ages a young female captive of noble extraction whose beauty attracted the eyes and admiration of the whole camp being brought before him scipio when he was informed she had been promised in marriage by lucius prince of the celtiberians and that the two lovers had a great affection for each other sent for the young prince and not only restored him the lady but forced him to take as a marriage portion the gold her friends had brought as a ransom and further offered him at the same time the friendship of the roman people  carthagena was a long time the indies of the romans and there are still silver mines in the environs the lead mines in the village of los alumbres are very rich amethysts and precious stones are found in its vicinity and not far from hellin there is a very considerable mine of sulphur  the country round carthagena was formerly called campo spartaio and the appellation of spartaria was also given to this city from the great quantities of spartum or spanish broom found in the plains and the mountains  carthagena was totally destroyed in the wars of atanagilda with agila king of the goths in spain several antique stones with inscriptions have been found among the ruins one of these is now in a garden in the town of espinardo near murcia it has one side the stern of a ship and on the other the figure of pallas holding an olive branch at her feet are the cornucopia and the caduceus of mercury cascalis for what reason we know not attributes this monument to julius caesar and supposes it to have been erected by him at the time when he formed the design of subjugating the world and his country  on the land side carthagena is defended by a mountain formed by three hills in the middle of the city is a high hill with a fort now almost in ruins the harbor is spacious and so deep that ships may moor close to the land it is a basin hollowed by nature which seems to have sheltered it from the winds by several hills placed round it at equal distances so that from the mole nothing but the entrance of the harbor and the basin are to be seen no port in the world can be compared with this for safety and regularity  the arsenal is very large and furnished with every thing that can facilitate the building and fitting out of a ship every requisite is in such readiness that a ship of the line may in three days be got ready for sea at the pleasure of the builder the water fills the magnificent basins which serve as stocks and the ship slides of herself into the sea  carthagena occupies the declivity of a hill with a little intermediate space between that and the harbor the city is protected from the south and the west by high mountains and barren rocks but to the north and the east it is open and communicates with an extensive valley  the streets are wide and the houses are commodious they have generally flat roofs which in a climate like this administers to the comfort of the inhabitants affording them a cool retreat where after sunset they may assemble to enjoy the refreshing breeze and the rainy season being of short duration these are sufficient to protect the interior of their mansions from humidity  the cathedral a miserable pile is now degraded and the bishops see being removed to murcia it is become a parish church of the convents not one is worthy of notice  there have been here  000 criminals chiefly smugglers who being condemned to work in chains are called presidiarios they are employed in the most servile labors some for five years others for seven and at the expiration of these terms like our convicts upon the thames are turned loose upon the public not corrected nor trained to industry but vitiated by the society of thieves  in the dockyard we omitted to observe a very singular circumstance viz that the masts and timber are floated in water without the least apprehension of their suffering by the worms because as they never open their sluices till the water is become putrid the evaporation proceeding with rapidity leaves a strong brine in which it is impossible the worm should live and in the north of spain where the evaporation is not sufficient for this purpose they bury their masts in sand and by pins prevent their floating when they are covered by the tide  in this city are made great quantities of the esparto ropes and cables some of them spun like hemp and others platted these cables float on the water and therefore are not liable to be cut by the rocks on a foul coast this rush makes good mats for the peasants houses and of late years it has been spun into fine thread for the purpose of making cloth we have remarked that this rush is the natural and peculiar production of all the high and uncultivated mountains of the south and here we cannot help admiring the transcendant goodness of providence in giving abundantly to man in these dry and elevated regions where neither hemp nor flax will grow materials proper for his clothing and the exercise of his industry  no one who has always lived in a temperate climate can conceive how much a traveller who passes the summer in the southern parts of spain suffers from the flies but there is no city says townsend so much molested by swarms of these insects as murcia to disperse them in some houses they have a large fan suspended over the dining table and kept constantly in motion in others one of the domestics are constantly engaged in waving the bough all the time the company is at table but the great have a servant at their elbow whose sole business is to keep off the flies with a napkin  want of fidelity to matrimonial vows says the above writer is equally prevalent at carthagena as in the other provinces of spain it was here that a gentleman said one morning to his friend before i go to rest this night the whole city will be thrown into confusion this he occasioned himself by going home an hour before his usual time to the no small vexation of his wife and her cortego whose precipitate retreat and unexpected arrival in his own house occasioned the like confusion there and thus by successive and similar operations was literally fulfilled the prediction he made in the morning  we have already traced this corruption of morals to one grand source the celibacy of the clergy in addition to this we may venture to assign another cause the want of admonition from the pulpit because the secular clergy seldom or ever preach the monks indeed descant on the virtues of their favorite saint but they seldom appear solicitous to improve the morals of the people  such has been the poverty of spain in point of pulpit orators that they have no author to recommend worthy of being noticed and if a preacher of more than moderate abilities appears he is admired as a prodigy and worshipped as a god  such says townsend was a famous capuchin who visited carthagena during my residence in that city and every evening preached in the great square to more than  0000 people this man licensed by the bishop and protected by the magistrates was constantly attended by a guard to prevent his clothes being torn from his back to be kept as relics what he delivered was heard with the most profound attention and after a discourse preached by him on the forgiveness of injuries many were reconciled and became friends who had before been at enmity one sermon however had a pernicious tendency it was that in cases of heresy they were bound to accuse at the tribunal of the inquisition their nearest and dearest friends yet so deeply is a sense of honor gratitude and filial piety impressed on the human heart that most of his hearers appeared neither to relish his discourse nor be convinced by his arguments but seemed to shudder with abhorrence at his doctrine  the baths of archena four leagues from murcia are esteemed useful in all maladies proceeding from the humors but are prejudicial in venereal cases they occasion violent and continued transpiration and it frequently happens that persons bathing in them are obliged to change their linen five or six times in the day those who drink these waters must use a great deal of exercise to carry them off the water is so hot that it is impossible to support the heat of it even with the hand for more than a second before it is bathed in it is beaten for a considerable time it is of a bluish cast very heavy and nauseous the froth or scum at the source takes fire like brandy  the roads in this province are horrid and over the high mountains are no other than such as the currents have made them  the kingdom of granada sometimes called upper andalusia borders to the west and north on andalusia to the northeast on murcia and to the east and south by the mediterranean it made part of the ancient boetica and was inhabited by the bastula sexitani etc its extent from east to west is about    leagues but its breadth varies being in some places scarce five leagues and in others at least  0  this province is intersected in every direction by very lofty mountains which form delightful valleys among the mountains those called alpuxarras are so high that the coast of barbary and the city of tangiers and ceuta are discovered from their summits they are about    leagues in length and    in breadth abounding in fruit trees of great beauty and prodigious size in these mountains the wretched remains of the moors took refuge so that they are covered with villages and are extremely populous these mountaineers seems to have preserved the industrious spirit of their ancestors they cultivate the vine and almost every sort of fruittree the produce of which they send to malaga  granada is one of the most healthy and temperate provinces of spain it contains an abundance of springs which water the whole country  the celebrated baths so extremely beneficial in diseases proceeding from cold humors are a league from granada four leagues from them are those of alicun which seem to be of a nature entirely opposite as they are chiefly efficacious in diseases proceeding from acrid humors  the water of the darro being drunk cures all sorts of diseases in animals it is termed by the natives a salubrious bath for their sheep  the mountains of granada contain several quarries of fine transparent jasper black green and red marble mines of granite amethysts and other precious stones  whilst this province was in the possession of the moors it was one of the best cultivated in the world the number of its inhabitants was immense and the valleys and mountains were covered with luxuriant plantations of vines and fruit trees each moor had his allotment of as much ground as sufficed for his habitation the maintenance of his family and the provender for his horse which every man was obliged to keep these small freeholds formed the general appearance of the country before the inroads and ravages of the christians had driven them into cities mountains difficult of access or quite away to the coast of barbary the single city of granada contained  0000 families and frequently sent out armies of  0000 infantry and  0000 horse an arabian author says that the kings had a constant supply of  00000 horses for their own use and for mounting their cavalry in time of war and more than once had mustered  00000 soldiers in actual pay for the purpose of making war upon the castillians but its present state is widely different depopulation is a terrible scourge to a country in many parts of granada the lands have no other ornament than the plants with which nature has covered them it is still however one of the most fertile provinces in spain and produces wine oil hemp flax sugar cinnamon oranges pomegranites almonds figs citrons lemons and raisins in great abundance the mulberrytree is cultivated here with success and the filk it produces is said to be finer than that of the kingdom of valencia here are also great quantities of honey and wax several towns in the mountains near antequerra make salt which the sun prepares from water conveyed into pans of the galls which are found in this country in large quantities a dye is made for leather this province likewise produces great plenty of dates from which considerable advantage is derived as also from the acorns which far exceed the finest nuts  this province first became a distinct kingdom in the   th century when the moorish king abenhud who resided at cordova having in the year      lost his wife and crown in a battle against the christians his subjects retired to granada and chose a new king who made that city his capital and place of residence this kingdom which was the last of the moorish contained    large towns and    smaller and continued from the year      to      when ferdinand the catholic reduced it and annexed it to the crown of castille the principal cities we shall notice are granada and malaga  granada is said to have been one of the largest cities in spain it is situated at the foot of the sierra nevada or the snowy mountain and stands upon two hills separated by the darro the xenil runs under the walls and these two rivers are formed by the melting of the snow with which the mountain is constantly covered the darro is said to carry with it small particles of gold and its name derived from dat aurum may be alleged as a proof the xenil in like manner rolls with its streams little pieces of silver when charles v came to granada in      with the empress isabella the city presented him with a crown made of gold gathered from the darro  several authors give to granada the title of illustrious and famous and some assert that it is still the greatest city in spain the country round it is  terrestrial paradise but extremely neglected  the moors are said to regret nothing but granada of all the losses they have sustained in spain they mention it in all their evening prayers and supplicate heaven to restore it to their possession the last moorish ambassador who came into spain obtained permission of the king to visit granada and on entering the alhambra or moorish palace he shed tears and could not refrain from exclaiming that the folly of his ancestors had deprived them and their posterity of this delightful country the date of the foundation of granada is said to be   0  years before christ in the time of the romans it was a municipal colony  the moors have left more monuments in granada than in any other city in spain from the great number of inscriptions and the fine edifices of the alhambra and the generalif or house of pleasure it might be imagined these people intended granada as the great depository of their religion manners customs and magnificence there is not a wall which does not bear some marks of their power but notwithstanding the reign of the moors in spain is buried in confusion and obscurity the ignorance of the spaniards their superstition and hatred of the moors have much contributed to this obscurity they either absolutely destroyed or suffered time to efface every thing bearing the marks of mahometanism and it may be said that chance alone has preserved those still existing although going daily to decay what information might not history have derived from them and how many fables might have been refuted and erased from our writings  the royal palace of the alhambra in this city is one of the most entire as well as the most magnificent of any edifices which the moors erected in spain it was built in    0 by the second moorish king of granada and in      in the reign of their eighteenth king was taken by the spaniards under the command of ferdinand as has been already mentioned it is situated on a hill which is ascended on a road bordered with hedges of imperial myrtle and rows of elms on this hill within the walls of the alhambra the emperor charles v began a new palace in      but it was never finished  the shell of it remains  the alhambra is a mass of many houses and towns walled round and built of large stones of different dimensions almost all the rooms have stucco walls and cielings some carved some painted and some gilt and all overloaded with various arabic sentences such as there is no other god but god which is repeated an infinite number of times all the floors are either marble or tiled e in particular is paved with two slabs of white marble each upwards of    feet long and about half as broad some of the walls are encrusted with a kind of coarse mosaic composed of pieces of different colored tiles representing stars and soliages  the first cortile on entering the palace is an oblong square with a fountain at each angle and in the middle is a canal of running water deep and wide enough to swim in round this cortile are several baths the walls floor and cieling of which are of white marble in those parts of the alhambra where bricks have been employed in the building the mortar between the bricks is as thick as the bricks themselves almost all the columns are of white marble and usually eight times their diameter which is one foot in length  the court most to be admired of the alhambra is that called the court of the lions it is ornamented with  0 elegant columns of an architecture which bears no resemblance to any of the known orders and might he called the arabic order architecture remarks bourgoanne like all other arts owes its origin to nature the goths a northern people inhabited caves the arabs and saracens spread over the country lived under tents hence that difference in the architecture of these nations the goths had flat cielings those of the arabs were terminated in a point as may be seen in most of the apartments of the alhambra  but to return to this celebrated square it is paved with white marble and at the extremities are two fine mosaic cupolas painted in gold color and azure and supported by several groups of columns portraits of several of the moorish kings are preserved under a kind of vaulted ceiling at one end of the court near this place is a cross painted upon the wall to indicate the place where the first mass was sung in the castle of the alhambra after it was taken by ferdinand  this magnificent court is surrounded by basins of white marble which form a kind of cascade ornamented with jets deau but its principal monument and that from which it takes its name is an alabaster cup six feet in diameter supported by    lions said to have been made in imitation of the brazen sea of solomons temple the cup is of one single piece ornamented with arabic figures and bears an inscription of    verses composed in that language the lions spout water out of their mouths  we next entered into the saloon of secrets which is a small octangular room a whisper at one corner is distinctly heard from the opposite corner but from no other place the bathingroom is entirely of marble and colored tiles and in the midst is a fountain which formerly supplied the baths with water here are besides a great number of fountains distributed in various rooms which still play  in one of the rooms are two roman statues of two nymphs of white marble as large as life with cornucopias and over a door is a very fine oval marble basrelief representing leda with the swan whose neck is twisted round hers and is besides in a very indecent posture  we afterward walked through the gardens which abound with orange and lemontrees pomegranates myrtles etc at the end is another palace called ginaraliph or the house of love and pleasure situated on a more elevated station than the alhambra from the balconies is one of the finest prospects in europe over the whole fertile plain of granada bounded by the snowy mountains close to the entrance of this palace are two exceeding large cypress trees which are near  00 years old and are called cypresses of the sultana queen as she was discovered under them in familiar conversation with abencerrage in one room the walls are covered with the three following inscriptions repeated hundreds of times in arabic god alone conquers  glory be to god  god is my hope  in the gardens are two jars or pitchers of blue and white earthen ware each seven feet high and five in diameter with various inscriptions  in examining this abode of magnificence says bourgoanne the observer is every moment astonished at the new and interesting mixture of architecture and poetry the palace of the alhambra may be called a collection of fugitive pieces and whatever duration these may have time with which every thing passes away has too much contributed to confirm to them that title  the city is divided into four wards the principal of which called granada lies in the plain and in the valleys between the two mountains here the nobility clergy merchants and most wealthy of the citizens reside its public and private buildings are very handsome and the streets arched for the convenience of supplying the houses with water by the means of conduits  the kings tribunal is held in a large and stately edifice and opposite to it is the alcaxeria a vast building where the merchants have their warehouses in the placa mayor are held the bullsights most of the small houses are moorish built or coarse imitations of that manner the modern masons decorating their walls with uncouth copies of saracenic mosaics from top to bottom says swinburne they seem to be nothing but rows of large windows divided by narrow brick pilasters  the outsides of the churches are painted in a theatrical taste and their insides set off with a profusion of marble brought from the neighboring mountains the dark green is the most valuable tables of an extraordinary size have been lately cut of that marble there are also many handsome brown marbles and alabasters diversified with an infinite number of shades and tints one whole street of artificers is employed in making little boxes bracelets necklaces and other nicknacks which they retail cheap enough it is usual in gentlemens houses to frame fine specimens of marble and hang them up in the apartments by way of ornament  the cathedral which in point of architecture stands very high in the opinion of the granadines is an assemblage of three churches ferdinand and isabella repose before the altar under a large marble monument full of figures and grotesques in a tolerable good style over the great door is the emblem of the united monarchies a bundle of arrows together clinched in the talons of an eagle  the alameda along the banks of the xenil is as pleasant a walk as any in spain this and another drive beyond the river are the chief resort of people both on foot or in coaches and the beauty of granada is no where more striking than from these points of view  the environs of this town are delightful even in the depth of winter every one allows that in summer granada is a delicious abode never too hot nor too cool refreshed by numberless streams and perfumed by all the sweets wafted from the gardens scattered over the declivities of the neighboring hills nothing can be more agreeable though at christmas than the walks along the heights of the alhambra a great concourse of people is always seen sitting there on the grass basking in the sun and diverting themselves as at a fair venders of cakes toys and liquors call their wares through the crowd the women come dressed out in all their finery black silk petticoats and veils in that dress every woman has something singularly alluring here indeed says swinburne the sex is handsome in any dress their complexions are fairer their skins clearer and their cheeks glowing with a brighter tinge than in any of the faces along the coast the distance of granada from the seaports has probably preserved it from the general infection of that odious disease which rages with such violence in all these trading towns the surprising purity of the air must also greatly contribute toward the freshness of their looks in many houses a current of water passes in an uncovered channel through bedchambers where people sleep winter and summer without its having the least bad effect upon their health fruit and butchers meat remain in the alhambra an unusual length of time without taint or putrefaction  the city does not contain more than  0000 inhabitants of which number   000 only are useful working hands the surplus is made up of lawyers clergymen children and beggars there are not less than  000 sturdy ablebodied rascals who live by arms and conventual donation  here is an academy as in all the great towns in spain for painting sculpture and architecture conducted at the kings expense and free for every one  as for the manufactures they are on the decay receiving but little encouragement from local situation and depressed and ruined for want of proper political management it is not possible to speak of view of malaga view of malaga manufactures in granada without recalling to mind the expulsion of the moors it is universally acknowledged they were numerous and that in consequence of their industry and frugality they had acquired opulence and power philip iii in the year   0  banished   0000 from the kingdom of valencia and  00000 from seville murcia and granada if to these we add the numbers who perished by famine and the sword we shall be inclined to state the loss to spain at  000000 of its most active subjects  this loss added to the previous expulsion of  00000 jews with all their wealth in the reign of ferdinand and isabella was under such a government as that of spain irreparable  the moors are acknowledged by the best spanish writers to have excelled in agriculture particularly in watering their lands in the cultivation of mulberrytrees the sugar cane rice and cotton in their peculiar breed of horses and in the manufactures of silk paper and gunpowder first brought into europe by them how then could it be reconciled to the system of sound policy to subject the country to such a loss  by their expulsion houses went to ruin and decay lands were left uncultivated commerce was neglected and manufactures felt the severest shock the sudden departure of this multitude left a vacuity which it was not easy to fill up more especially by a nation which having for the space of seven centuries been trained to war had learnt in that long interval to look down with contempt upon all who were engaged in the mechanic arts and more especially to despise those occupations in which their antagonists excelled  numerous privileges and immunities enjoyed by the hidalgos or knights have contributed very much to confirm hereditary prejudices to the detriment of trade till the year      their persons and goods were free from arrest they are not sent to the common gaols but either confined in castles or in their own house on their parole of honor they are not hanged but strangled they are exempted from various taxes to which others are liable none but the royal family can be quartered on them to conclude the noble female conveys all these privileges to her husband and children in the same manner as the eldest daughter of the titular nobility transmits the title of her ancestors  the proportion of hidalgos in this province is not considerable for out of    000 inhabitants only about  000 are nobles but in the kingdom of leon where there is not one third of that population the knights amount to   000  the manners of the inhabitants are nearly the same as in the other inland cities the morning is employed in business by those who have any thing to do or in visits to the ladies they dine early and eat after the spanish fashion with the sopa the olla and various kinds of meat stewed in their little pitchers except at one or two of the principal houses where the french cookery prevails after dinner they go to the fiesta in the evening to the paseo or public walk when the evening closes they assembly at the tertulia where they generally amuse themselves with cards  their morals are much like the rest of spain the monks are exceedingly debauched and the women do not want admirers  malaga is a small but very ancient city the phoenicians built it several centuries before christ and called it malacha on account of the great quantities of salt fish sold there ptolemy and pliny give it the name of malaca and the latter adds that it belonged to the allies of the romans antoninus in his itinerary describes a road from castelon to malaca and another from malaca to gades or cadiz strabo speaks of it as a carthaginian colony very commercial and famous for its salted provisions  after having been built by the phoenicians it passed successively under the dominion of the carthaginians romans goths and moors the first sovereign who swayed the scepter there and made it the seat of empire was haly abenhamith when this monarch had established his sovereignty over the kingdoms of granada and murcia he marched at the head of his victorious troops to cordova where having slain the usurper zuleman he took possession of the vacant throne and left the united empire to his posterity  it was not till the year      that ferdinand and isabella recovered malaga from the dominion of the moors at that period it must have been a place of considerable strength and two strong towers with their communicating walls appear to have been the chief dependence of the besieged  the town is situated in a valley of no great extent on the side of a deep ravin which in summer contains no water but in winter affords a passage to a considerable river a moorish castle on the sharp point of a rock commands every part of it bourgoanne gives it the appellation of a handsome city and that the mole is supported by a magnificent quay townsends description of the city is that the houses are high the streets contracted and that many of them are not more than eight feet wide others not even so wide and that they are all badly paved and dirty even to a proverb  of the buildings whether public or private the only one worthy of the least attention is the cathedral a very stupendous pile begun by philip ii while married to mary queen of england their united arms are still to be be seen over the door it is assured by some travelers who have measured both churches that this cathedral is as large as that of st pauls in london  the convents though numerous are few of them remarkable either for architecture or for any monuments of art the bishopric is a very considerable one being estimated to bring in near l  000 sterling a year  there are about    foreign houses says swinburne settled in trade at malaga who export  000 butts of wine a year of which the price runs from  0 to  0 pounds a butt till within these last  0 years the quantity sent off was double but no difference being made in england on the duties between old and new wine the exporter grew careless in the quality of the wine sent and the demand of it sell one half  townsend on the other hand says that one merchant whom he names martinis exported  000 butts a year and other merchants in the same proportion to their usual sales the other exports are fruit oil and fish their fish are anchovies of which in years of great abundance they have sold  0000 barrels of two quintals each it is computed there are from  00 to  000 vessels which enter the port of malaga every year of these one tenth only are spanish  the chief dependence of this country is on the vines these are cultivated with much labor and at a great expense when it is considered that these vineyards are always on the declivity of hills inclined toward the scorching sun it may be readily conceived that the labor is severe and that the people who with unremitted application perform this task cannot deserve the character of drones the peasants of no country upon earth are more patient of heat hunger and thirst or capable of greater exertions than this very people who have been accused of indolence in the district of malaga it is computed there are   000 vine presses chiefly employed in making the rich wines which if white from the nature of the country round malaga being high rugged and pointed is called mountain if red from the color vino tinto known to us by the name of tent  for the purpose of making these wines fuller in the body and sweeter than they would otherwise be the grapes are left to be very ripe then being cut they are exposed to the sun to evaporate their moisture after which they are pressed and put into vessels with a due proportion of inspissated vinous syrup  murders and assassinations with every species of violence and excess must without the strenuous exertions of the magistrate and the strict execution of the laws be frequent in a country where whenever the wind blows over land all the passions are inflamed and in some persons almost to frenzy yet here justice when most awakened pursues offenders with a tardy step slow in its approach and uncertain in its vengeance instances are cited of criminals who have died forgotten in their prisons and of others who whilst under sentence of death have married had numerous offsprings and been brought forth to execution when all recollection of their crimes had been long since obliterated  in summer the inhabitants of these sultry regions where the overwhelming heat of the sun is succeeded by the refreshing coolness of the evening wander abroad and when the light is gone all the young people bathe for hours in the sea the sexes however do not bathe promiscuously but at some distance from each other at such seasons to prevent intrusion the spot where the ladies are is guarded by sentinels with loaded muskets and should a gentleman attempt to swim round to them it must be at the hazard of his life whenever therefore a young person is determined to intrude he goes in disguise as the female attendant of some frail fair and in that character passes unobserved  this custom of bathing every night is practiced not so much for pleasure as for health being intended to obviate the inconvenience arising from the excessive heat yet notwithstanding the diseases proceeding from relaxed fibers are very prevalent for not to mention those which arise from irritability of nerves the consequence of debility tertian and putrid fevers rage with such violence that more than  000 persons died says townsend in the year he was there besides multitudes in the city and its environs  chap xviii of the province or kingdom of cordova and andalusia this ancient kingdom is one of the smallest in spain it has been by some writers comprehended under andalusia which in former times comprised granada cordova and seville but the province of cordova which was the eastern part of andalusia having been by later writers spoken of separately we shall follow that division and include only the kingdom of seville under the general name of andalusia of which in the ancient division it formed the western part  in the province of cordova there appears little in its modern state to attract attention busides its capital it is situated in a plain of great extent bounded on the south by swelling hills cultivated to their very summits and on the north by a chain of rugged mountains the continuation of the sierra morena through the midst of the plain runs the guadalquivir and the whole country being well wooded well watered and well cultivated cannot be surpassed either in riches or beauty  this city anciently called corduba was illustrious so far back as the time of the romans strabo says it was founded by marcellus and was the first roman colony established in spain all who have written on cordova have called it the mother of men of genius in the first ages after the foundation of this city it possessed a university in which all the sciences were cultivated strabo says the ancient books of the turdetani their poverty and their laws all written in verse were here preserved it had the honor of giving birth to the two senecas and to lucan the poet  and when abdoulraman after subduing the south of spain had established here the seat of his dominion a d     the sciences with arts and arms which were every where else abandoned took up their residence and flourished in this city it was within the walls of this city that the  0 philosophers and physicians who composed and put in order the works of avicenna were formed  this city says peyron has preserved nothing of its ancient grandeur except a vast enclosure filled with houses half in ruins and the famous mosque built by abdoulraman in the eighth century this monument is really worthy the attention of the curious after the conquest of cordova it was converted into a cathedral and not more than half of it now exists but such as it is nothing would equal its magnificence were the height proportioned to its extent  the roof is sustained by a great number of coumns placed in such an irregular manner as to make it very difficult to count them they are reckoned to be above  00 townsend says he should suppose there were many more some descriptions of this church reckon    aisles others only    but the whole is such a scene of confusion as renders it very difficult to give any tolerable idea of this building it is said to have been a temple of janus before the time of the moors which is very probable from some of the columns having corinthian capitals the columns are each of a single piece some of marble some of jasper of granite of porphyry of alabaster of verde antico etc the square before this church is very beautiful being planted with  0 large orange trees in the midst is a pond full of tench and on each side a fountain continually playing these are environed with cypress and palm trees  a bridge of    arches defended by a large moorish tower leads from the south into cordova and near the end of the bridge stands the above mosque converted into a cathedral the walls of the town are in many places just as the romans left them  this city contains   000 inhabitants    parishes and    convents few of the public or private buildings are conspicuous for their architecture the great square is large and regular and surrounded by porticos the bishops palace is seated on the side of the river and his gardens are open to the public  the ancient palace of the moors has been converted into stables in which  00 andalusian horses are generally kept their genealogy is carefully preserved and the name and age of each written over the place in which he stands and as the horses are very spirited their hinder feet are fastened to iron rings fixed to a staple in the ground the mares are kept in the environs and in the proper season the horses are taken to them  cordova is the greatest market for horses in all spain it is here that the most beautiful and so justly celebrated andalusian horses are to be seen which it is death to export they are all long tailed and entire very few geldings being seen in spain mates are only kept for breeding and treading out the corn these are allowed to be exported they are fed with wheat straw which is preferable to hay by reason of its juicy delicacy sometimes barley is given to them  this city say twiss is the most agreeable of any in spain for a place of residence  here are about  0 noble families who alternately spend the evenings at each others houses they live in great splendour and have equipages much more magnificent than in any other part of spain here are    or    coaches chariots or phaetons which were lately made in london and as many more procured from paris all these says the above writer i had an opportunity of seeing drawn by four and six longtailed beautiful prancing stonehorses as it was then whitsuntidefair the footmen were all dressed in gold and silver laced liveries at a ball to which i was invited the english country dances consisted of near  0 couple the refreshments were chocolate lemonade icecreams cakes and various kinds of wines and liqueurs the saloon we danced in very large hung with crimson damask enriched with several of the st ildefonso lookingglasses the ceiling of white stucco with gilt foliages and the whole of these elegant decorations executed in the french taste among the company much more freedom might be observed than at any grand ball in england and none of that obstinate shyness and reserve so peculiarly charasteristic of the british nation most of the furniture in these palaces was english as chairs tables carpets etc  upon the borders of this province on the sierra morena or chain of mountains separating andalusia from new castille and called morena from its brown color is the new colony of la carolina planted a few years since by the king in a very extensive tract of woody mountainous country the first settlers were germans but from eating unwholesome herbs and drinking too freely of spirits above half of them died and now the inhabitants are a mixture of germans french savoyards and spaniards  they talk of  0000 families being already settled here every new comer on application receives a lot of land a house two cows one ass five sheep as many goats six hens with a cock one pregnant sow a plough and a pickaxe with other emoluments of inferior value they begin with  0 fanegas of land of  0000 square feet each and when they have cultivated these they receive  0 more free of all rent for the first ten years and after that period subject only to the royal tithes  la carolina the capital of all the colonies stands on a fine hill towering over the whole settlement for the sake of thus overlooking the rest of the plantations they have placed it in a spot deficient in wood and water and reduced themselves to the necessity of digging an incredible number of wells for the purposes of drinking and watering their gardens the whole town was new from the foundations for there was not a cottage there ten years since the streets are wide and drawn in straight lines but the ground is not sufficiently levelled the houses are upon one uniform plan without the least decoration all the flat on the crown of the hill is laid out in kitchengardens and planted with avenues of elms to serve hereafter as public walks  considering that the town has been built and peopled in less than ten years we cannot but admire the energy and zeal of olavide the founder who conceived the idea of introducing agriculture and arts in the desert mountains of the sierra where rapine and violence had for ages established their dominion this colony however says townsend is far from prospering which has been generally attributed to the want of a market for the surplus of their produce  the same remarks have been made by swinburne who says there does not seem to be an outlet from this settlement in case their manufactures should arrive at any perfection for it is extremely remote from the sea and many days journey by land from the great cities in spain where the consumption of their commodities might be expected to turn to any account  andalusia is bounded by that long chain of mountains called sierra morena on the north by murcia and granada on the east by granada the streights of gibraltar and the atlantic on the south and by portugal from which it is separated from the guadiana on the west its extent from east to west is about  0 leagues but its breadth varies very much being in some places not above  0 it has the advantage of near  0 leagues of seacoast  the name of andalusia which it owes to the vandals who settled here in the fifth century is derived from vandalenhaus and from thence by corruption came andalusia in former times it was called tartessis and boetica the moors took possession of this province in the eighth century the river guadalquavir by the ancients called boetis and tartessus traverses the whole country and the guadiana as we have before remarked separates it to the west from the portuguese algarve of the other smaller rivers some run directly into the sea as the odier and the tinto the water of which latter river cannot be drank being noxious even to herbs and the roots of trees and having neither fish nor any living creature in it and the guadalate or river of oblivion others fall into the guadalquivir as the guadiamar and the xenil which rises in granada etc  andalusia is reckoned the finest province in all spain abounding in exquisite fruits of all kinds honey excellent wines grain silk sugar fine oil numerous herds of cattle particularly horses metals cinnabar and a certain species of quicksilver the heat in summer is very great but the inhabitants generally deep in the daytime and travel and follow their occupations in the night  the principal cities in this province are seville cadiz and gibraltar  seville the capital of andalusia stands on the banks of the guadalquavir in the midst of a rich and to the eye a boundless plain it is surrounded by a wall of more than a league in circumference with     towns the ancient name of this city was hispalis which name was preserved to it by the latins the goths from hispalis made hispalia but the arabians who came after them not pronouncing the p called it ixbilla of which the castillians have made seville arias montano derives the name hispalis from the phoenician word spala or spila which in that language signifies plain or field of verdure the romans granted it the privileges of a roman colony and called it julia romula or little rome  hercules is said to have been the founder of seville and the opinion is so general that it is current among the people by long tradition it is even inscribed on the gates of the city  there still remain in seville several statues of hercules and caesar besides that supported by two antique columns at the alameda of the    hercules mentioned in history or fable two came into spain one was a lybian the other from thebes the latter came to cadiz with the argonauts and went thence to gibraltar where he founded a city which he called heraclea this hercules came about  000 years after the other so famous for his    labors his strength and his courage it remains to be known which of the two founded seville  under the roman government this city was embellished with many magnificent buildings the very ruins of which have long since disappeared the gothic kings made this city their residence before they removed their court to toledo in the general confusion ensuing upon the downfall of the kingdom of cordova in  0   seville became an independent sovereignty  ferdinand the third king of castille after a years reign forced seville to open its gates to him and acknowledge his sway three hundred thousand moors are said to have left the city upon the capitulation and to have carried their arms and industry to such countries as were obedient to the law of mahomet it is difficult to conceive how seville could continue to be a great and populous city after such an emigration yet we find it in a few years enlarged adorned with new buildings the chief of which was the cathedral and long enjoying the rank of one of the most considerable cities in spain  its most brilliant epoch was soon after the discovery of america when all the treasures from that quarter of the globe were poured into europe and seville made the magazine of its valuable productions the sovereign frequently honored this city with his presence merchants from all parts flocked hither to open houses of commerce or to provide themselves with goods for foreign markets the sailors and adventurers of the indian fleets rendezvoused here and with wanton prodigality lavished the wealth which they had acquired in america then indeed was the time when the spaniard cried out in the fullness of his heart he that has not seen seville has not seen the wonder of the world its court was then the most splendid in europe its streets were thronged with an immense concourse of people its river was crowded with ships and its keys covered with bales of precious merchandise great were the buildings begun and still greater the projects for future ones its prosperity seemed proof against the fickleness of fortune when the danger and embarrassments in the navigation of the guadalquiver occasioned it to fall from the highest pitch of grandeur to solitude and poverty from the superior excellence of the port of cadiz the galeons were ordered to be stationed there in future  the shape of seville is circular without any great rising in its whole extent the walls seem of moorish construction or of the ages following the dissolution of the saracenic empire the ditch in many places is filled up the circuit of the walls is not more than six miles the suburb of triana on the west side of the river is as large as many towns but remarkable for nothing but its gloomy gothic castle where in      the inquisition formed its first establishment in spain  seville says twiss is the largest city in the kingdom of spain and is situated in the middle of a plain as level as any part of holland the river guadalquiver divides it into two unequal parts that on the south side is called triana these parts are joined together by a mean and shabby bridge consisting of planks laid on ten boats forming the segment of a circle according as the tide runs  there were at the time i was there says the above writer    dutch vessels lying near the bridge waiting for their cargoes of wool which is a very dangerous commodity for if proper care be not taken to air it frequently by opening the hatches of the vessel it takes fire a dutch vessel was by this means burnt down to the waters edge a short time before my arrival this happened in the river so that the crew saved their lives but if such an accident should happen at sea the consequence is evident this river is neither broad nor rapid but very deep  the streets are narrow and some of them so contracted that both walls may be touched at the same time few are wide enough for carriages and many through which coaches pass show by the deep furrows in the walls that one have touched and often both at the same time  this city is said to contain  0000 inhabitants and is divided into  0 parishes it has    convents with    hospitals  of the public edifices the cathedral is the first to demand attention it is a building of singular magnificence but chiefly admired for its tower the work of guever a moor it was originally built only   0 feet high but was afterward raised  00 more and is therefore at present   0 feet it has no steps nor are they required because the inclined plain is so easy of ascent that a horse might trot from the bottom to the top and at the same time it is so broad that two horsemen might ride abreast on the top of this tower is the giralda or large brazen image    feet height which with its palmbranch weighs near one ton and a half yet turns with the slightest variation of the wind the effect of this tower rising above every edifice in seville is extremely noble  the moors erected this tower about the year  000 tradition relates that to form a solid foundation for it the moors made a deep hole into which they cast all the marble and stone monuments of the romans that could be found when repairs have been necessary and the ground has been opened near the bottom many broken ornaments and inscriptions have been discovered for some purpose unknown to posterity the architect has made the solid masonry in the upper half just as thick again as that in the lower though on the outside it is all the way of the same dimensions  the dimensions of the cathedral are   0 feet by     and the height is     it was built a d   0  this cathedral receives light by fourscore windows with painted glass the work of arnao of flanders each of which cost  000 ducats  the treasures of this church are inestimable one altar is wholly silver with all its ornaments as are the images large as life of s isidore and s leander and a tabernacle for the host more than    feet high adorned with    columns yet the value of these is trifling when compared with the gold and precious stones deposited by the piety of catholics during the period in which all the wealth of the newly discovered world flowed into this city the profusion of gold silver and gems would be more striking were not the attention occupied and lost in admiration of innumerable pictures which were the works of those spanish masters who flourished immediately after the arrival of the art in seville  to the cathedral belongs a library of  0000 volumes collected by hernando son to christopher colon the first discoverer of america  the new organ in this church contains   00 pipes with   0 stops which are said to be  0 more than in the famous one of harlaem yet so capacious are the bellows that when filled they supply the organ    minutes the mode of filling them with air is singular a man walks backwards and forwards along an inclined plain of about    feet in length which is balanced in the middle on its axis passing ten times along the inclined plain fills the bellows  in the cathedral are    altars at which are said daily  00 masses the annual consumption is   00 arrobas of wine  00 of oil and  000 of wax the archbishop has a revenue of nearly l  000 a year there are besides eleven dignitaries who on high festivals wear the mitre amply provided for  many of the convents are remarkable for the beauty of their architecture but in seville the eye covets only pictures and amidst the profusion of these it overlooks works which in other situations would rivet the attention and every where fixes on the pencil of murillo his most famous performances are in the hospital de la caridad and suited to the institution express some act of charity the church of the capuchins is also richly furnished with his works eleven of his pictures are to be seen in a chapel called de la vera cruz belonging to the franciscans but the most masterly of all his works says townsend is in the refectory of an hospital designed for the reception of superannuated priests it represents an angel holding a basket to the infant jesus who standing on his mothers lap takes bread from it to feed three venerable priests no representation ever approached nearer to real life nor is it possible to see more expression than glows upon that canvass this great painter was born in the year      and died in      his name stands high in europe but to form an adequate idea of his excellence every convent should be visited where he deposited the monuments of his superior skill in exactness of imitation he has been equalled in the clair obscur and in reflected lights he was surpassed by velasquez but not one of all the spanish artists have gone beyond him in tenderness and softness  murillo valasquez and de valdes three of the best spanish painters were all born in or near seville no wonder therefore that so many of their paintings are to be found in this royal city  the alcazar or palace of the moorish kings is an irregular building but commodious and pleasantly situated comprising many large and well proportioned rooms the modern part of this palace has the celebrated motto of charles v plus ultra inserted in every room together with the imperial eagle charles was fond and vain of this motto  the garden is singular and having obtained its pristine form is meant to serve as a model of the moorish taste it is laid out in alleys with clipped myrtle hedges and in the middle of the parterres are single trees cut into the form of warriors with spiked clubs the whole of this pleasure garden with the palace and the courtyard is surrounded by a strong rampart communicating with but much higher than the city wall and beyond this is an orange grove of considerable extent for the winter and for the spring there cannot be a more delightful residence  of the convents that which is upon the most extensive scale belongs to the franciscans it contains    cloisters many of which are elegant and spacious with apartments for  00 monks their annual expenditure is about l 000  the university was founded in the year   0  and soon rose into consideration the name of arias montanus who lies buried at the convent of s jago is alone sufficient to give celebrity to this seminary his translation of the holy scriptures will be valued by the learned as long as the scriptures themselves shall be the object of veneration to mankind the number of under graduates here is about  00  the spaniards look upon this city and its environs as a perfect paradise especially in fine evenings which they are seldom without when all the people of fashion repair to the neighboring fields in their coaches to breathe the fragrant air perfumed with a variety of sweet flowers and blossoms that nature produces in almost every season the olives are the best in europe and are here in prodigious quantities there is a grove of them not far from the city twenty miles in circumference  the almeida or mall is about three furlongs in length divided into four shady walks by five rows of trees it is besides embellished with fountains and seats and small canals of water running along the border of each row of trees this mall is further remarkable for having two very high columns of granite taken from a temple of hercules which existed here in times of very remote antiquity on the top of one is placed a statue of hercules and on the other that of julius caesar at the other end are two modern columns with a lion on the top of each  between the hours of six and eight in the evening the spanish ladies resort hither in their carriages and from ten to midnight they return again to walk especially on sundays attended by their corlejos  the royal tobacco manufacture is situated just without the walls it was built in      wholly of white stone the building is a square of   0 feet and of two stories in height the chief front has    windows and the others nearly the same number fifteen hundred men are constantly employed in this manufacture of sugars and snuff and   0 horses alternately turn  0 mills for the same purpose the whole fabric cost nearly half a million sterling the net revenue amounts to one million sterling it being the only manufacture in the kingdom  there is but one door by which it can be entered to prevent laborers from smuggling the tobacco which some of them nevertheless found means to do by a very uncommon method which was discovered by their being obliged to be cured of the inflammation happening to the part where they had concealed it the first three or four days of their coming to work the volatile parts of the tobacco and snuff affect them so much as to cause them to stagger and reel as if they were intoxicated  the leaves of the tobacco are imported from cuba and the brazils the best snuff is called grance eight shillings a pound is the current price of the snuff in seville it is made by grinding and mixing the tobacco with the red earth of almazarron sir walter raleigh a kind of ochre the excessive adulteration of this earth practiced of late years by the directors has occasioned a great falling off in the exportation of this commodity and unless they alter their method the trade will soon be confined to spain and its dominions  the universal use of snuff and tobacco in almost all countries and the vast sums of money gained by its commerce and manufactures is wonderful when we consider how few years have elapsed since its first introduction compared with other articles of commerce sir walter raliegh was the first person we are told that smoaked it and this while he was in america and it is related whilst he was lighting his pipe having sent out his black servant for something to drink the poor fellow on his return finding the smoke issue from his masters mouth in volumes conceived him to be on fire and instantly threw the contents of the pot in his face in order to extinguish it  the silk manufacture was formerly considerable at seville when ferdinand iii in the year      entered the city he found as it is said   000 looms which employed   0000 persons and such was the population of the city that the moors who left it when it was surrendered to the christians were  00000 besides multitudes who died during a    months siege and many who remained after their fellowcitizens were gone on the first discovery of america they once more reckoned   000 looms but some heavy taxes imposed by philip ii during the latter end of his reign and the subsequent expulsion of the moors gave a shock to commerce it has not yet recovered  in the vicinity of seville is a curious monument of antiquity the amphitheatre of italica it is an oval of     feet by  0  italica is the city where trajan adrian and theodosius the great are supposed to have been born of the ancient colony of italica supposed to have been composed by scipio of his veteran soldiers scarce any vestiges remain it is said the moors destroyed it not to have a rival so near seville the amphitheatre is now more like stonehenge than a regular roman edifice  about four leagues from this city is a small tower called la torre de quatro abitas which may be shaken by a person who ascends it to such a degree as to spill liquids out of a glass and twiss from whom this extract is made farther says he has been assured that all along the coasts of spain are watchtowers from mile to mile with lights and guards at night so that from cadiz to barcelona and from bilboa to ferrol the whole kingdom may by these means be successively alarmed in case of an invasion  the country round the city to a considerable distance lies so low that it is frequently overflowed and upon some occasions the water has been eight feet high even in their habitations the soil is rich and being at the same time very deep its fertility is astonishing the produce is corn leguminous plants hemp flax lemons oranges and liquorice the quantity of liquorice exported annually from spain is said to amount nearly to  00 tons a considerable part of which is purchased by the porterbrewers in london the importation of this produce from spain has increased very rapidly within these few years from being only three tons in the year      it became  0 tons in the year      into the port of london only and     tons including the outports from which circumstance we may collect that london has taught the country brewers the use of this innocent drug in making porter  in consequence of vapors and miasmata from standing waters and frequent floods the inhabitants of seville and its neighourhood are subject to tertian and putrid fevers and to hysterical disorders these disorders may likewise be occasioned by the quantity of melons and cucumbers consumed by them all the year in consequence of which they are likewise infested with worms accompanied with epilepsies there are other diseases which originate in heat whenever they have the solano wind that is whenever the wind blows from africa they become liable to pleurisies but what is chiefly complained of by the physicians and magistrates is an irritability of nerves influencing the morals in a variety of ways  a d      the consumption of flesh in seville was         lbs of which the ecclesiastics had    0   lbs free from taxes  cadiz or as the english generally pronounce is cales was not less famous in antiquity than when it became the staple of general commerce from spain to the indies  the phoenicians had no sooner landed in spain than they founded a city which they named gadez or enclosure upon that tongue of land which the greeks believed to be the western extremity of the world  this place became very powerful under the empire of the romans they embellished it with several temples and if the ancients may be believed the ceremonies and dogmas of religion had there a more sublime meaning than in the rest of the world altars were dedicated to the year the month to commerce and what is still more surprising gadez contained the statue and temple of poverty the temple of hercules built by the phoenicians in this city was the most famous it was here he vanquished the triple geryon the great antiquity of the temple gave rise to fabulous tales among the numerous columns with which it was decorated were two of brass upon which unknown characters were engraved according to the roman historians it was near this place julius caesar found the statue of alexander which inspired his ambition with such bitter complaints no sacrifice of animals was made in this temple nothing but incense was burned within the walls and by an institution not remarkable for politeness and difficult to be explained women and swine were forbidden to enter it the priest who offered up the sacrifice was to be chaste to have his head shaved his feet bare and his robe tucked up some authors pretend that there was no statue in the temple not even that of the divinity to which it was dedicated by hercules the phoenicians meant to indicate the almighty power of the supreme being  it is recorded by some old french writers that during the time of the romans their great riches had introduced such luxury that the girls of gades were sought after in all public rejoicings as well for their skill in playing on different instruments of music que pour leur humeur qui avoit quelque chose de plus que de lenjouement  the small peninsula on which cadiz is situated embraces a very considerable extent of the sea and with its two extreme points called los puntales forms a noble bay the work of nature which is about three leagues long and two broad its entrance is in breadth a short league the two points appear contrived expressly to defend the bay  cadiz occupies the whole surface of the western extremity of the isle of leon this island bears resemblance to a pear with a long stalk and is in length from the southeast to the northwest about six leagues the northwest end where the town stands is scarcely half a league in breadth at the southeast end of the ancient bridge of suaco thrown over a deep channel or river affords a communication between the island and the continent  the island with the continent opposite to it forms a bay four leagues in lenght and in most places two in breadth except about the center of the bay where are two points of land which approach so near as to command the passage one of these points is on the island and the other on the continent within these points of land is the harbor two forts are erected on them fort puntal and fort matagorda which must be taken before an enemy can enter the harbor these two forts are well fortified and render the harbor perfectly secure during the time of the ebb a great part of the harbor is dry  the bay is so spacious that there are moorings for the different vessels according to their various destinations  cadiz is surrounded with walls which contribute more to its embellishment than to its defense  cadiz contains several regular squares the streets are broad straight and at present almost all paved with a large white and smooth stone in which care has been taken to cut it in such a manner as to prevent the horses and mules from slipping  the swarms of rats that run about the streets in the night are incredible whole droves of them pass and repass continually which makes walking late in the streets extremely troublesome  the houses are very high with each a vestibule which being left open till night serves passengers to retire to this custom which prevails throughout spain renders these places exceedingly offensive in the middle of the house is a court like a deep well under which is generally a cistern the breeding place of gnats and mosquitos the groundfloors are warehouses the first stories compting houses or kitchens and the principal apartments up two pair of stairs the roofs are flat covered with an impenetrable cement and few are without a mirador or turret for the purpose of commanding a view of the sea round the parapet wall are placed rows of square pillars intended either for ornament agreeable to some traditional mode of decoration or to fix awnings to that such as sit there for the benefit of the sea breeze may be sheltered from the rays of the sun but the most common use made of them is to fasten ropes for drying linen upon high above all these pinnacles which gives cadiz a most singular appearance stands the tower of signals here flags are hung out on the first sight of a sail marking the size of the ship the nation it belongs to and if a spanish indiaman the port of the indies it come from  the public walk or alameda is pleasant in the evening it is customary to walk here till midnight among the rest says twiss i observed several ladies who had fixed glowworms by threads to their hair which had a luminous and pleasing effect the alameda is planted with double rows of white elms seats of stone are fixed on each sides it is parted from the coachroad by iron rails and commands a fine view of the ocean this walk is as much resorted to by ladies of easy virtue as our st jamess park and is the only place in spain where such barefaced licentiousness and libertinism is to be seen  at the extremity of this walk westward is a large esplanade the only airing place in this city it turns round most of the west and south sides of the island but the buildings are straggling and ugly  they reckon now in cadiz not more than  0000 inhabitants but about ten years since it is said to have contained near  0000 besides  0000 that entered daily from the sea and the adjacent country  the most distinguished buildings are the two cathedrals the one ancient the other not yet finished the former is chiefly worthy of notice for some good pictures and its treasures consisting of gems silver candlesticks and lamps both numerous and bulky and three custodias or tabernacles one of which constructed of the finest silver and weighs more than half a ton another is mostly of solid gold  the new cathedral is an immense pile with large and lofty domes and many pillars well proportioned yet the whole appears heavy and disgusting this is attributed to its being loaded with a very projecting cornice which in a rotunda of large dimensions would not be void of elegance but is by no means suitable to an edifice abounding with angles all who view this building are struck with the absurdity of this preposterous ornament it is not impossible however that the waves may soon wipe away this disgrace to taste as they have already begun their devastations on that side and not more than ten feet are interposed between the building and the sea  in the convents are some good pictures more particularly in the cloister of the augustine friars and in that of the capuchins are some most worthy of attention by murillo  of the three hospitals two are remarkable for their neatness the third deserves most commendation for its general utility it is called the royal or military hospital because designed for soldiers it has fourscore students maintained and educated at the kings expense one of the two distinguished for neatness is set apart for women the other designed for men is elegant all the wards are paved with marble in checkers of black and white and instead of white walls wainscoting or stucco the sides are covered with dutch tiles  in this hospital are generally about  000 patients and out of these they annually lose one tenth  there is also a retreat for widows founded by a turkey merchant settled at cadiz who died a d      aged  0  in this hospital    widows have each two good rooms with a weekly allowance of six reals but the most interesting establishment in cadiz and the best conducted of the kind in spain is the hospicio or general house of industry in it are received the poor of every nation unable to maintain themselves and in the first place orphans deserted children and the aged who are passed the capability of labor the blind the lame idiots and mad people but especially priests when aged and reduced to poverty even strangers passing through the city with permission of the governor may be entertained here for two days  neatness universally prevails and all who are here received are clean well clothed and have plenty of the best provisions the young people are taught to read to write to cast accounts and such as manifest abilities are not only instructed in the principles of geometry but if they are so inclined are taught to draw the boys are trained to weaving and to various crafts the girls spin wool flax and cotton they knit make lace or are employed in plain work  to encourage industry an account is kept of what every individual earns out of which he is made debtor to the house for about three reals a day and the overplus given to him when he can make it appear he is able to establish himself without their future aid i examined the accounts of many says townsend who cleared for themselves more than half a crown a week and were looking out for settlements that they might marry and gather the fruits of their industry  adjoining to the house is a spacious shop for the accommodation of all who are willing to work wherein are provided proper implements and raw materials and the moment any one has completed his work he receives the price of his labor without any deduction being at liberty not only to lodge where he pleases but to spend his gains according to his own fancy  but because many who would work are indispensibly confined at home where from poverty they are unable to procure either wheels or wool the governors provide both and pay them without any deduction for their work townsend instances three children employed by them the eldest nine years of age who by spinning gained six reals that is more than    pence a day and maintained a paralytic father  not satisfied with these exertions they have established schools in the distant quarters of the city and providing masters in every branch of business freely admit all who are desirous of being taught  the management is vested in    directors who are presided over by the governor of the city for the time being with power to fill up of themselves any vacancy which may happen in their body  the source of their revenue are from voluntary contributions legacies a tax on all wheat brought into the city and from the produce of labor in the house  the agreeable and amiable qualities of the fair sex renders a residence at cadiz delightful the ladies possess to a very uncommon degree the pleasing exterior of the andalusians modified by the society of strangers and by that general desire to please which the refinements of society and a concourse of admirers maintain in continual activity pleasures are not much varied at cadiz during some years there was a french comedy the only theater at present is the national one which rivals those of the capital and sometimes is enriched by their losses the situation of the city but of a middling extent for a population of  0000 inhabitants and which the sea almost surrounds renders the pleasures of public walks but very few at a quarter of a league from the landgate sterility again appears and continues for several leagues round if a few kitchengardens and some orchards in the vicinity of the isle of leon be excepted where waterings supply the want of moisture in the sandy dryness of the soil the bullfights are exhibited in the hottest months of the year this being one of the few cities in spain where they have not been banished and it is not that in which the people are least delighted with them  they have an italian opera and a french theater upon a very grand scale supported by the voluntary subscriptions of the french merchants  the end of the carnival at cadiz differs very little from the beginning no public balls or masquerades being allowed the only marks of the festivity of shrovetide the last day of the carnival were pailfulls of water which the women in the balconies poured upon the men in slouched hats and cloaks that passed within their reach there were however many assemblies and balls of a lower class where the fandango was danced a la ley that is in all the perfection it is capable of among the gypsies there is another dance called the manguindoy so lascivious and indecent that it is prohibited under severe penalties the turns are simple like that of the fandango being little more than a return of the same set of notes this as well as the fandango is said to have been imported from the havannah being both of negro breed on the coast of africa it is likewise said they exhibit a variety of strange dances pretty similar to these from whatever country the fandango may have originally come it is now so thoroughly naturalized in spain that every spaniard may be said to have been born with it in his head and his heels toward the close of the great balls given heretofore in the theater when all the company appeared drooping with fatigue it was a constant trick of the fiddlers to strike up this dance in an instant every one started up and the whole house resounded with the uproar of clapping hands footing jumping and snapping of fingers  this is the most commercial city in spain the first marine department and the center of all the traffic to america and the west indies cadiz says the author of the voyageur francais in his account of the trade of this city is the place where the english french dutch and italian merchants send their goods to be exported to america in spanish vessels which are divided into three classes the fleet flota the register ships and the galleons the flota consists of three men of war and    or    merchant ships whose burden is from  00 to  000 tons these vessels are laden with the best european productions silk stuffs linen velvet ribbonds laces glass paper hardware watches clocks shoes stockings books prints pictures iron utensils wine fruit etc so that every nation is interested in the lading spain hardly contributes any thing but wine which with the freight broker age and taxes to the king are all the advantages she derives from this commerce the fleet sails from cadiz to la vera cruz the vessels which compose it are not allowed to part company nor to put in nor break bulk any where on the voyage it takes in return gold silver jewels cochineal indigo tobacco sugar coton etc  the register ships are equipped by and sail for the account of some private merchants of seville and cadiz when they think the americans are in want of certain goods they present a petition to the council of the indies and desire leave to send each of them a vessel of  00 tons for which leave they pay a certain sum and besides are obliged to make considerable presents to different officers and though they only obtain leave to send vessels of  00 tons they generally send those of at least double that burden  the galleon fleet is composed of eight ships of the line chiefly destined to furnish peru with warlike stores but they are also filled with various merchandise for the account of private persons twelve other vessels sail under their convoy this fleet may only trade on the coasts of the south sea and the other is limited to mexico  the whole trade of cadiz engages about  000 vessels of which nearly onetenth are spanish  the wines most remarkable in cadiz are sherry and pacaretti both from xeres and its vicinity the former is sold for    pounds a ton the latter for    when they come to england they pay in the out ports excise and customs near  0 pounds a ton but in the port of london near three pounds more  the people who most abound at cadiz are first the irish and next the flemings genoese and germans the english and dutch are not numerous there are many frenchmen but more among the workmen of every kind and retail dealers than among the merchants it appears however that the commerce carried on by foreigners in this city is very much on the decline this is attributed chiefly to the extension of the commerce of the spanish indies formerly confined to this city and to several other ports of the kingdom of spain  the manufactures of this city are very inconsiderable that of salt is the most interesting branch of industry the salt pits encompass a great part of the bay from puntal to port st mary the salt manufactures sell what remains to them after furnishing the kings magazines more or less dear according to circumstances the nations who purchase it are sweden denmark holland england and particularly portugal the fishermen from st malo dieppe and granville sometimes go to the bay of cadiz to take in cargoes of salt for newfoundland and when the salt pits in france fail the french take large quantities of it for home consumption  every commercial nation has a consul resident at cadiz those of england are the only ones not allowed to have any concern in trade  the stir in this city is prodigious during the last months of the stay of the flota the packers possess the art of pressing goods in great perfection but as the freight is paid according to the cubic palms of each bale they are apt to squeeze down the cloths and linen so very close and hard as sometimes to render them unfit for use the exportation of french luxuries in dress is enormous lions furnishes most of them england sends out bale good and the north linens  at about four leagues from cadiz is chiclana a handsome village where the merchants of cadiz have their country houses these they have embellished and surrounded with that verdure of which they are deprived in their town residence the citizens of cadiz carry thither and enjoy for a time all the luxuries of the capital dinners suppers balls concerts all the display of opulence and every ornament of the toilette this village is if we may so express it a theater opened by luxury and taste in which the polite and amiable display their charms smooth the brows of the calculators who accompany them and generously bestowing unnumbered pleasures oblige them to confess that there are things more precious than gold  gibraltar this town which has been in possession of the english since the year   0  is seated at the foot of the famous mount calpe generally known by the name of one of herculess pillars the other being mount abyle directly opposite to it on the african coast mount calpe is a high and steep rock standing by itself and joined to the spanish continent by means of a low neck of land about two hundred fathoms broad the town of gibraltar is built on a slip of land which runs out into the mediterranean sea and forms a bay called the bay of gibraltar the mountain or rock which defends it on the land side is half a league high and so steep that there is no ascending it by a body of troops if they met with opposition its perpendicular height above the level of the sea is fourteen hundred feet many apes and monkies inhabit its caverns and precipices and are frequently shot it is thought that these animals are not produced in any other part of europe the birds called solitary sparrows are also found here  in blowing up the rock in various places many pieces of bones teeth etc are daily found incorporated with the stones on the west side of this mountain is the cave called s michaels eleven hundred and ten feet above the horizon it contains many pillars of various sizes from the thickness of a gooses quill to two feet in diameter formed by the droppings of water which have petrified in falling the water is perpetually dripping from the roof and forms an infinite number of stalactitae continually increasing in bulk which will probably in process of time fill the whole cavern at the end of this cave is a hole about six feet in diameter of which the depth is uncertain the signal house built on the highest part of the mountain commands a prospect of the town the bay the straits mount abyle or apes hill on the african shore the city of ceuta and great part of the barbary coast the town of s roque and algeziras and the snowy alpuxarra mountains at night an infinitely greater number of stars maybe discovered from hence by the naked eye than from below because in this elevated situation the atmosphere is much more pure and thin  gibraltar is not so considerable for extent or beauty as for its strength or situation which renders it the key of spain it is accordingly provided with all the artillery stores and forces necessary for its defense seven regiments generally are in garrison here and six hundred men are always on guard at a time the discipline observed here is very strict and the officers always appear in their regimentals there are   0 guns mounted on the fortifications and there is room for  00 more those of the grand battery are of bronze and the rest of iron they are all fired in succession on the kings birthday this performance takes up half an hour at sunrise sunset and at nine in the evening a gun is daily fired  in the year   0  the united fleets of england and holland after a cannonading of only a few hours took it by surrender and though the spaniards endeavored to recover it the following year by a formal siege and afterward by a blockade they miscarried in both and at the treaty of utrecht the english were confirmed in the possession of it in the year      the spaniards again attempted gibraltar but with no better success than before a fresh attempt was likewise made on the side of the town during the late war by the means of floating batteries which likewise failed this last attempt would have proved successful had it not been for the stratagem of firing red hot balls on them from the garrison which set fire to the greatest part of the new invented batteries and dispersed the rest  the spanish lines are a fortification running across the isthmus which separates gibraltar from the continent a regiment of infantry several batteries and a fort at each end defend this view of gibraltar view of gibraltar barrier of the spanish monarchy it is about half an hours ride from the landgate of the english garrison  this most extraordinary fortress and mountain has been so often described by particular histories prints and drawings that we have given a view of it  the views published by major mace are exact and convey a very good idea of the four different faces of the mountain since the time of their publication general boyd has completed the roads up the hill in every necessary direction a carriage may now go up to the signalhouse which before seemed a place where none but goats could climb up  the strait to which this town gives name is about eight leagues in length and five in breadth there is a strong current setting into this strait from the atlantic which will carry a vessel ten miles an hour and requires a very strong gale to stem it  the town consists chiefly of one street which is tolerably broad and well paved the other streets are crooked narrow and dirty it contains an english church a roman catholic one for the spaniards and portuguese who inhabit this town to the number of  00 and are mostly shopkeepers and for about  00 genoese chiefly mariners and a synagogue for the jews who amount nearly to the number of  00 the number of the english may be about  000 exclusive of the military besides these there are a few hundred moors who continually pass and repass to and from the barbary coast trafficking in cattle fowls fish fruits and other provisions as nothing is to be had from spain which neither jews nor moors are ever suffered to enter  there is a small theater here where the performances are well got up the actors are military gentlemen and the actresses such by profession  all european coin are current here but considerably under the value a guinea passing for no more than    shillings and sixpence and five spanish reals for not more than three  no person is allowed to go out of the english territory either by land or sea without a pass from the governor who grants the inhabitants one annually no vessels nor even boats are suffered to land their people in any of the spanish posts till after they have performed a quarantine of three or four days here are taverns coffeehouses billiardtables shops etc as in england the governors garden is open to the public and much resorted to on sunday evenings  the province of andalusia watered throughout its whole extent by the guadalquivir if properly cultivated would produce corn sufficient not only for its own consumption but for exportation yet the wheat annually imported is little less than one million and an half of fanegas the fanega being generally one cwt but at cadiz something less nearly one half of this quantity in the year      came from africa and the remainder except about   000 fanegas imported from america was furnished by naples sicily and sardinia in cadiz to prevent a scarcity of corn and to make a profit by the sale of it the city has established a public granary from which the bakers are supplied at a given price and according to that the magistrates regulate the assize of bread  the country between cadiz and algesiras which lies on the bay of gibraltar is one of the most desert of those not quite uncultivated for ten leagues says bourgoanne i crossed the duchy of medinasidonia which in this district consisted of cornfieldsd and pastures in no part of them was the vestige of a human habitation the great proprietor seems to reign there like the lion in the forests by driving away with his roarings those who otherwise might approach him instead of men and women i met with seven or eight great herds of horned cattle and some troops of mares on seeing them free from the yoke and bridle wandering over an immense region unbounded to the eye by barrier or enclosure we were ready to imagine ourselves in the first ages of the world when animals in a state of independence divided with man the dominion of the earth found every where their own property and were not that of any person this province has been divided into great possessions as far back as the conquest of it by the moors the principal castillian noblemen who then accompanied the conquering kings obtained enormous grants in perpetuity according to the fatal custom introduced into almost the whole of the monarchy the extinction of males in the great families increased the inconvenience rich heiresses carry with them their opulent portions into families not less opulent so that this absurd succession is become if we may so express it a vast tontine which will sooner or later make the greatest part of spain the inheritance of a few families who shall survive the rest  the peasantry in this province seem very poor and frugal in their diet bread steeped in oil and occasionally seasoned with vinegar is the common chart of the straits of gibraltar map of the straits of gibraltar food of the country people a bunch of grapes or a slice of melon serves as a dessert  the andalusian says peyron may be compared to the gascon for extravagant expressions vivacity and vain boasting he is easily distinguished among a crowd of spaniards hyperbole is his favorite language he embellishes and exaggerates every thing and offers you his purse and his services in as little time as he takes to repent of having so done he is a bully an idler lively jovial attached to the ancient customs of his country nimble wellmade extremely fond of women and loves dancing pleasure and good cheer  chap xx constitution and government having now gone through the different provinces and cities and given an account of their ancient and present state their manners customs trade manufactures and other local circumstances we shall proceed to treat of the kingdom in general as to its constitution government laws revenues forces literature religion etc  first as to its constitution spain from gothic times to that of pelagius was an elective kingdom and for two centuries after him the throne was filled by the suffrages of the states who departed however in no instance from the royal family but from ramir i to alphonso v all the concern the states had in the creation of a new king was to acknowledge him as a lawful and worthy successor and since the latter there appears not the least trace of an election the crown always of course without any form or ceremony devolving to the nearest in blood the kings of spain have sometimes limited the succession to certain families ranks and persons of which the first instance was philip iii in the year      and the second philip v in      females here are also capable of inheriting the crown on failure of the male line in case of a total extinction of the royal family it is an uncontroverted persuasion that the right of electing a king would revert to the people if the next heir be incapable of government and especially if on the decease of the king affairs are in confusion the states are empowered to choose five persons to take the administration upon them among whom the queen mother is to hold the chief place  the kings title at large runs thus ferdinand by the grace of god king of castille leon arragon the two sicilies jerusalem navarre

king though before assumed by some kings of spain and other sovereigns was in   00 solemnly conferred on ferdinand v by pope alexander vi since the year   0  the hereditary prince is styled prince of the asturias but becomes so always by creation the other royal children are called infantes  the kings power is unlimited and the states of the kingdom consist of the clergy the ancient nobility and the deputies of the towns since the beginning of the   th century or the time of philip iii the cortes or dyets have been discontinued no other assembly than conventions of the deputies or agents of the towns having been thought necessary in which are settled the necessary taxes and imposts without any infringements on the privileges of the ecclesiastics and nobility whom unquestionably the king summoned to those assemblies when the public good required it  the history of spain says bourgoanne sufficiently proves how great an influence the cortes had formerly in the most important affairs of government these for a long time have not been assembled except for the sake of form and the sovereigns without violence or formally rejecting their intervention have found means to elude their authority they promulgate from the throne ordinances under the name of pragmatiques the preambles of which gives us to understand that they claim the same authority as if they had been published in the assembly of the cortes which are never convoked except at the accession of a new sovereign to the throne to administer to him an oath in the name of the nation and to swear to him fidelity  on this occasion letters of convocation are sent to all the grandees to all persons bearing titles of castille an honorary distinction to all the prelates and to every city which has a right to send deputies to the cortes the first two classes represent the nobility the bishops sit in the name of the clergy and the cities which depute one of their magistrates represent the people except on these occasions the cortes of the whole kingdom have not been assembled since philip v convoked them to give their approbation to the pragmatic sanction for changing the order of succession to the throne  they are still consulted for forms sake in certain cases but then the members of which they are composed correspond with each other without assembling a faint image of them however remains in an assembly which constantly resides at madrid under the name of diputados de los reynos or deputies of the kingdom  at their breaking up when convoked by philip v it was agreed that they should be represented by a permanent committee whose business it should be to watch over the administration of that part of the taxes known by the name of millones and which had been granted under philip vi with the formal consent of the cortes upon certain conditions which that monarch swore to observe they retained the administration of these imposts till the year      when cardinal alberoni whose ardent and impetuous genius was irritated at such shackles transferred the administration of it into the hands of the sovereign from that time the assembly of deputies of the kingdom have held no more of the state revenues than the small portion necessary to pay the salaries and defray the expenses of the members these deputies are only eight in number and are chosen according to the ancient division of the provinces of the crown of castille and those of the crown of arragon  these two parts of the monarchy differ from each other with respect to the administration form and collection of taxes a distinction which had its origin at the time when castille and arragon were united by the marriage of isabella and ferdinand the catholic and which since that time has undergone but few alterations all the provinces of castille unite to name six catalonia and majorca one and the regencies of valencia and arragon elect the eighth these deputies sit six years at the expiration of which a new election takes place as a relict of their ancient rights they still retain the privilege of being by virtue of their places members of the council of finance by which the sovereign communicates to the nation the necessity of levying any new tax and the approbation they are supposed to give to the royal resolution is a shadow of the consent of the cortes without which taxes could not formerly be either levied or augmented the provinces of biscay and navarre which have assemblies and particular privileges send also on some occasions deputies to the throne but they do not make a part of the body of deputies of the kingdom and their constituents fix at pleasure the object and duration of their temporary mission  from this sketch of the present constitution we may perceive how little the sovereign authority is limited in spain how feeble must that rampart of liberty be which is only formed of a small number of citizens possessed but of little real power under the control of government from whom they expect favors and preferments and who after all represent only the people the most numerous but the least respected part of the nation the will of the monarch is also carried into execution by several other permament bodies under the name of councils who are the interpreters and keepers of the law but before we treat of these it will be proper to say something concerning the ministers who are constantly near the person of the monarch and with whom alone he at present shares the weight of royalty their authority was formerly counterbalanced by the council of state which still subsists and forms the most distinguished body in the monarchy but which since the administration of cardinal alberoni has not been permitted to assemble and exercise its functions the place of counselor of state is therefore now only honorary with a considerable salary annexed to it and furnishes the sovereign with the means of rewarding those of his subjects who have deserved well of the state in the most distinguished employments the want of this assembly of the counselors of state is now supplied by the sovereigns uniting the ministers of the six principal departments into a committee  for the administration of the kingdom is divided into six grand departments the minister of foreign affairs is in many respects the directing minister and receives as a mark of distinction the title of secretary of state the minister of war has but a very circumscribed authority he is president of the council of war which is rather a tribunal than a board of administration the inspectors of the different regiments draw up a statement of whatever relates to the corpse of which they have the direction and the minister at war has only to present the memorials they give in to the king  the marine minister has no associates the chiefs of the three departments and the inspectors of the marine are named by the king on the representation of the minister the marine ordinances prepared by him require only the sanction of the sovereign  the minister of finances who should properly be under the inspection of the superintendantgeneral of that department were some time since united and will probably be so continued this minister is besides president of the council of finance  the minister of the indies has the most extensive department in all the monarchy for in him is centered the civil military ecclesiastical and financial government of spanish america and it may be said that in the whole political world there is no minister whose department comprehends so many different objects had augustus committed to one single minister the government of the whole roman empire his power would only have extended to a small part of modern europe the coasts of africa and some provinces of asia for the roman empire at the time it was most extensive was not to be compared to that immense country which from the north of california stretches to the straits of magellan and forms the dominions of the spanish monarch in america and the department of the minister of the indies  the minister of favor and justice has his department in the judiciary and ecclesiastical affairs but his authority is controuled by the great chamber of the council of castille of which we shall treat hereafter and with respect to the nomination to benefices by the intervention of the kings confessor the latter however depends upon the will of the monarch and the confidence with which he honors the director of his conscience  these six offices are usually filled by six different persons but until the year      the same minister held those of the marine and indies which are so connected that the good of the nation will perhaps require them to be again united  the stability of ministers is one of the most remarkable peculiarities of the court of spain the monarch who in disposing of these eminent places consults public opinion has hitherto had the singular happiness of his approbation never having been dishonored by the event for which reason his ministers without abandoning themselves to indolence ardently labor to justify his confidence and lose not that time which is to them so precious in watching the latent springs of court intrigues in order to disconcert their secret machinations they have the courage to form vast projects knowing that they are certain to find a constant support in the benevolence of the monarch there is nothing to divert them from an attention to the duties of their office pleasures do not abound at the spanish court there are no theatrical representations of any kind the amusement of the sovereign and the princes is confined to the chase this though a great inconvenience to the idlers about the court is of unspeakable advantage to public affairs ministers may there dedicate the whole of their time to business and audiences the simple and regular life that they lead is greatly to be admired walking is almost the only amusement they permit themselves their principal society consists of their clerks who habitually eat at their tables this reciprocal constraint has some inconveniences but there results from it a greater union between the heads and the subalterns in office and more unanimity in the conduct of affairs those who dispatch them under the eye of the minister are not in fact merely clerks they may rather be compared to the principles of our offices to be appointed to these places it is necessary to have given proofs of talents in some confidential employments there are no doubt abuses in the public offices of the court of spain as well as in all others but in general corruption is very rare and persons in office are polite and obliging with respect to the ministers themselves nothing less than the esteem of the nation and the love of public good can make them amends for so entirely renouncing the greater part of the pleasures of life  the supreme royal council of castille holds the first rank among the councils and tribunals of the kingdom it is at once a council of administration which has the inspection of all the interior operations of govonment and a sovereign tribunal that has exclusive cognizances of certain causes and in certain cases receives appeals from the other tribunals the oldest members of this council form what is called in spain the camara which is properly the privy council of the monarch and at the same time a sovereign tribunal for certain causes such as all which relate to the right of patronage the succession of persons of the royal family and all contests relative to the rights of cities civdades which differ from villa the former having a particular jurisdiction and being represented in the cortes of the kingdom madrid for example is only a villa yet is represented in the cortes like the civdades  the camara is also the council which issues all acts or patents of royal favor all places in the magistracy and all consistorial benefices are conferred by its means it recommends to his majesty through the medium of his minister of favor and justice three persons to fill them and the king chooses one of the three  no place in the magistracy is venal in spain this like all human institutions has its advantage and inconvenience if it leaves a greater opening to caprice favor and intrigue it prevents the tribunals from being dishonored by incapacity and ignorance and diminishes the temptation to sell that justice of which the right of dispensing it had been previously purchased it is true that the integrity of magistrates frequently without fortune must appear suspicious and that their moderate fees seem but a weak barrier against corruption however notwithstanding the declamations of dissatisfied clients iniquitous and partial judges are not more common in spain than in other countries  there is a kind of gradation in the spanish magistracy of which the degrees are easily traced all the members of the camara are ancient counselors of castille these seldom obtain their places without having been presidents in some inferior tribunals in the same manner from among the advocates corregidors or alcaldes mayores the latter are chosen it may here not be amiss to give some account of the different species of alcaldes which are frequently confounded by foreigners so much so as if in england a sheriffs officer was to be taken for a justice of the peace or vice versa  first there are two classes of simple alcaldes established in the cities boroughs and villages the alcalde ordinario judges in the first instance when there is no corregidor but in places where there is one he has cognizance of civil causes in concurrence with him whilst the latter acts only in matters of police the alcalde pedanco taken from the lower class of people has no other functions but those of arresting delinquents and executing the orders of the corregidor or alcalde mayor  the simple alcaldes are differently appointed according to the places in which they reside the alcaldes mayores or corregidors which have both the same meaning are all named by the king upon the presentation of the camara this inferior degree of magistracy was formerly under very improper regulations the place of corregidor being bestowed on persons of small fortune who frequently expended their whole property in soliciting the promotion after having succeeded they held their places three years when their office expired and they were again obliged to have recourse to new solicitations how could it be expected that men scarcely escaped from want and upon the brink of relapsing into their former indigence would not be tempted to insure to themselves resources at the expense of those over whom they possessed a transient authority it was necessary to preserve the subjects of the king from their rapacity and the magistrates from temptation men virtuous from an innate love of virtue and who resolve firmly not to commit evil though they can perpetrate it to their advantage and with impunity are rare in every country and the corregidors but too frequently confirmed this melancholy truth it was therefore determined that they should continue in office six years instead of three that there should be three classes of them and that they should pass from one class to another after having well discharged the duties of their first place that their emoluments should be increased at every removal and that having thus gone through the three classes to the satisfaction of his majesty they should have what is called in spain the honors of togado that is the title and prerogatives annexed to the place of counselor of the superior tribunals whether their acknowledged merit was rewarded by one of these places or that they still continued to occupy the post of corregidor of the first class  it now remains to show how justice is administered in madrid as well as in the rest of the kingdom the roman or civil law may be said strictly speaking to have here no force this by some old ordinances of the kings of castille is even forbidden under severe penalties to be so much as quoted these laws however which for so long a time were the object of a blind admiration and against which it is now become the custom to declaim with virulence are frequently consulted in practice the spaniards observe a just medium between the two extremes they do not adopt the civil law implicitly and look upon all its decisions as infallible but their lawyers derive from it knowledge and authorities being convinced that in the midst of a number of laws contradictory to each other many are to be found dictated by reason and applicable to every legislation  the only authentic laws according to which justice is administered are registered in the codes published by the ancient kings such as are the ley de las siete partidas the ordenamientoreal the fuerojuzgo and fueroreal the principal code that which is in constant use is called recopilacion it is a collection of various and distinct edicts of the monarchs of spain from the earliest ages to the present reign a new edition is given from time to time in which all the laws published since the last are inserted for it is not till after they are thus registered that certain edicts acquire the force of law  the canon law is the received code in spain in all ecclesiastical matters but it must not be imagined that the court of madrid pays implicit obedience to the orders of the holy see there is no catholic kingdom in which more successful efforts have been made to lighten this yoke  there still exists in spain very great abuse arising from religion ill understood this is the extreme riches of the monks and clergy next to the ecclesiastical principalities of germany the richest catholic prelacies are found in spain the archbishoprics of toledo seville st jago valencia and saragossa have larger revenues than any in france there are monasteries the property of which extends to the greatest part of the district in which they are situated and these religious foundations while they depopulate and impoverish the neighboring country increase poverty and idleness by indiscriminate charity  the government however which becomes more and more enlightened is endeavoring to lessen the consequence of these evils in the first place the wise choice of prelates prevents in them that display of offensive luxury which by irritating indigence diminishes the respect due to religion their constant residence in their diocese makes them expend their revenues in the country by which they are paid all the prelates there employ a great part of their income in alms when we come to treat of taxes it will be seen that they pay considerable contributions  in spain there is but one religious institution which philosophy mourns to see that nation subjected to it may be easily perceived that by this is meant the holy office that tribunal to which every odious epithet has been given and which has still in spain two powerful supporters policy and religion  its defenders allege that the authority of the sovereign find in the holy office a means of making itself respected since by chaining the consciences of the subjects it provides another security for their obedience they assert that religion gains by it the preservation of its unity and purity and attribute to the inquisition the tranquillity which spain has in this respect constantly enjoyed whilst the rest of europe has been a prey to all the bitterness of religious quarrels and the turbulent zeal of innovators  the antagonists of the inquisition maintain on the contrary that it has fed superstition and fanaticism and kept the mind in a servile subjection fit only to repress those vigorous efforts of genius by which great works of every kind are produced that while it contracts the heart by fear it prevents the sweet effusions of confidence and friendship destroys the most intimate connexions which constitute their charms and for two whole centuries has condemned spain to ignorance and barbarism  these are no doubt very serious accusations but an account of the present state of this tribunal will show how far they are well founded the establishment of the holy office was cotemporary with the religious wars with all the outrages which fanaticism has produced in most of the states of christendom but since that period manners are happily become more civilized and if the primitive constitution of the spanish inquisition has not been changed the rigours of it have at least been softened and are become less frequent auto de fes are not the same pompous solemnities as formerly when by their apparatus under pretense of honoring religion they insulted humanity when the whole nation ran to them as to a triumph when the sovereign and all his court were present believing they thus performed a most meritorious act in the eyes of the deity and there enjoyed the torments of those victims delivered up to the executioner and the maledictions of the people  the forms of the procedure excepted the inquisition may at present be esteemed as a model of equity and mildness it takes every possible means of verifying the depositions it receives let it not be said says bourgoanne that the resentment of a secret enemy is sufficient to provoke its rigours it condemns not upon the evidence of one accuser nor without discussing the proofs of the accusations serious and repeated crimes are necessary to incur its censures which with a little circumspection in words and conduct respecting religion are easily to be escaped and men may live as unmolested in spain as in any other country in europe the indiscreet zeal of some of the commissaries indeed disturbs the quiet of the inhabitants in some cities by entering their houses to confiscate pictures too licentious or books that are prohibited but this zeal is repressed either by the court or the grand inquisitor who in the present and late reign has always been a learned and prudent prelate  as a proof of this some french merchants at cadiz having received a consignment of leather from one of their manufactories were much alarmed at seeing the officers of the inquisition enter their houses they desired to see the leather that was just arrived and having observed that it bore the image of the holy virgin which was the mark of the manufacture exclaimed against the profanation they remarked that the leather being intended to make shoes the image of the mother of christ ran the hazard of being trodden under foot and therefore confiscated it the affair was referred to the supreme tribunal of madrid the merchants much alarmed had recourse to the court by the medium of their ambassador the consequence of which was that the officers of the inquisition were enjoined not to molest strangers on such trifling pretenses and the merchants recovered their leather without further trouble  on other occasions still more recent the minister and the grand inquisitor have protected the inhabitants against the cavils of the subalterns of the holy office in a city of andalusia they attempted to give disturbance to a french house because they were protestants and when it was observed to them that the english and other northern nations were tolerated in spain though they were heretics it was answered that the catholic religion was the only one established in france the cause however of this persecuted house was no sooner brought before the court than it was gained  in fine though we should admit that bigotry is more prevalent in the capital than in the provinces no great inconveniences can arise from it because the sentences of the provincial tribunals have no force until they have received the sanction of that of madrid besides the court scrutinizes more strictly than ever the proceedings of the inquisition and certainly not with an intention of increasing its severity  the holy office to this day receives a certain tax from each vessel that arrives in any of the ports of spain in consequence of the examination it is authorized to make in order to see that the vessel contains nothing that may be offensive to religion the search has been for a long time neglected but the duty is still paid  before we quit this subject we shall take notice of another political body which many strangers confound with the inquisition but which has no other relation with it than the common epithet  this is the holy thermandad much spoken of in spanish novels it is no more than a confraternity in different parts of the kingdom of castille to watch over the safety of the country by apprehending those who disturb the public peace it is subordinate to the council of castille who do not permit its jurisdiction to extend to cities  having now taking a general view of the constitution government and interior administration of the spanish monarchy both in civil and religious matters we proceed to treat of its finances and population or rather of the causes of its depopulation  chap xxi on the finances population and general state of the kingdom the finances of spain may be divided into two classes and these compose most of the revenues of the king general rents and provincial rents  the general rents arise from duties paid at the frontiers upon merchandise entering or going out of the kingdom this duty has been increased by degrees in many of the provinces to    per cent upon every article of importation or exportation it varies however in different provinces and in some is not more than four or five per cent ad valorem there are besides several articles such as cocoa chocolate sugar and paper which pay particular duties  the whole produce of the general rents when they were farmed did not amount to more than about l  0000 a few years after they were put into commission they produced l 00000 and in      they produced l  0000  there are some other duties which may be included in the general rents although differently collected and their produce does not enter the same chest such are the duties of the office of health first established at cadiz and since extended to the other seaports in spain  secondly the duties of the grand admiral which were appropriated to the treasury by ferdinand v in      and two other duties one under the name of lanzas the other of medias annatas or half the first fruits the first is an annual contribution of nearly l 0 paid by all the grandees of spain and by every citizen honored with the title of castille the half of the first fruits is paid at each descent of the above titles and amounts to about l  0 it is also levied upon all employments to the amount of half the first years income upon entering into office  the produce from the sale of salt makes a separate article in the finances of spain this is exclusively sold for the kings account the same as in france yet the revenue from salt is not considerable and scarcely exceeds  000000 livres which is not the tenth part of what it produces in france though the population of this latter country is not more than double that of spain  there is still a greater difference between the profits arising to these two kingdoms from the sale of tobacco which is sold exclusively for the account of the sovereign in spain the produce of this article is calculated at  0000000 of livres whereas in france previous to the late revolution it produced near seven times as much  the prohibitory laws on this article in spain are very severe and in certain cases makes the punishment of selling it death this like all other laws which are too severe is seldom enforced great quantities of tobacco are smuggled into spain and those who vend it at the exorbitant price of a guinea a pound to gratify the inclinations which mankind always have for whatever is prohibited are considerable gainers by this illegal traffic  there are also other articles sold exclusively for the kings account these are brandy lead gunpowder cards spanish wax and stamped paper  the most reprehensible part of the spanish taxes however is the second class the provincial rents a species of imposts which falling upon the necessary articles of life is a burden to the people and one of the greatest obstacles to industry  the provincial rents are first the produce of a duty upon wine oil meat vinegar candles etc this was first levied under philip ii in    0 who being overwhelmed by the ruinous enterprises to which his ambition had impelled him proposed it to the cortes upon conditions most of which have been violated this grant has been renewed every six years and had different augmentations called the services of the millones because it was for a certain number of millions of ducats that it was made  secondly a duty of ten per cent on every thing sold or bartered whether used in manufactures or husbandry to be paid every time the property is transferred this tax was first granted by the cortes in      it was then but five per cent in      it received the increase of five per cent more and was made perpetual in the   th century it received four additions each an hundredth part whence it acquired the name of cientos  these two duties united ought therefore to amount to    per cent but they vary in different cities and provinces according to particular privileges granted by the sovereign which in some places have entirely superseded them and they are no where levied to their utmost extent which however does not prevent their being very burdensome to industry and commerce  the tercias reales are another impost collected with the provincial rents these are twoninths which the court of rome in      permitted the kings of spain to receive upon all the tenths of their kingdom they are paid in kind from the produce of the earth and afterward sold for the kings account this impost with two or three others collected under the same denomination is not very productive but would be susceptible of considerable augmentation were government in collecting it not to trust to the unfaithful statement of the ecclesiastical offices  the duties of entry into madrid also form another source of revenue to the crown these are at present farmed out to the community of gremios or five united companies of madrid at  0000000 and a half of reals  all these interior contributions which relate only to the provinces of the crown of castille produce about   00000 pounds the provinces of the crown of arragon have another form of taxation having no provincial rents such as those abovedescribed they pay one general contribution which each city borough and community assesses on its inhabitants as some of these provinces were the last to hold out against philip v this form of taxation was intended as a punishment but his intention has been defeated as in fact they are better treated than the rest of the kingdom  catalonia which more than any other province excited the monarchs indignation was subjected to a register in which all the lands were undervalued and taxed at eight per cent on their annual rents but they scarce pay more than one per cent to this register was added a tax upon industry but this not being arbitrarily assessed is not burdensome and neither of them are prejudicial to agriculture or industry in catalonia  these provinces are however subject to the tax called tercias reales and obliged to take at a fixed price the salt tobacco lead etc which are sold for the kings account they are also equally subject to the bull of the crusade the primitive object of this bull was to grant indulgences to those spaniards who should contribute to support the war against the infidels until the reign of ferdinand vi this grant of the court of rome was to be renewed every five years the inconvenience of which philip v was very sensible on three different occasions when his disputes with the holy see prevented a renewal of the bull it was not till      that by compact with the court of rome this bull was made perpetual since which time it has been a constant source of revenue to the treasury the price of it is sevenpence or sevenpencehalfpenny no catholic in spain can dispense with purchasing it without having his orthodoxy suspected provided with this bull besides the other indulgences annexed to it such as a remission from certain sins he has the liberty of eating meat with the consent of his physician and confessor as also to eat eggs and milk on fastdays and in lent  for this bull the nobles pay according to townsend about six shilling and fourpence the commons about one third of that sum in arragon but less in the provinces of castille no confessor he adds will grant absolution to any one who has not this bull townsend says the produce of this tax is reckoned at above l 00000 per annum but bourgoanne does not estimate it at quite so much  the clergy are not exempt from this tax nor is this the only one they pay in the first place they are in part subject to that of millones but to this it is necessary the pope should consent every six years by a brief besides as in most cases fact differs from right the clergy pay next to nothing of the millones which tax falls upon the body of the people  there is another impost called subsidio to which the clergy are liable this is one per cent granted by the pope to the kings of spain upon all ecclesiastical lands for the wars against the infidels  but the greatest contribution levied upon them is the escusado which consists in the right granted by the holy see to the kings of spain to appropriate to themselves the most advantageous tenth of each parish throughout the whole kingdom in every parish the king chooses the best farm whether for olives corn or wine of which he takes the tithes both in castille and arragon the clergy formerly agreed with him for this afterward it was farmed by the gremios or five united companies of merchants at madrid for   000000 of reals but in the year      the clergy had the grant for one third less most of them accepted the offer but they who thought themselves too poor to venture refused and these farms are let to the gremios at  000000 the gremios have been accused of this bargain to purchase corn in all the country villages when it is cheap to lodge it in their granaries and then selling it out at a high price to starve the people and enrich themselves  it may be imagined that spanish america is one great source of revenue to the royal treasury but hitherto its produce has been but trifling for a long time the expenses of the administration of these immense colonies were not defrayed by the revenues they produced and it is only since the administration of m de galvez that mexico has yielded a surplus by the establishment of the farm of tobacco the indian revenue in america is said to amount to near  000000 and an half sterling  all these duties and contributions says bourgoanne of which we have given a summary acaccount amounted in      to no more than   0000000 of livres or about  000000 and an half sterling and the expenditure was then exceeded by the receipts this according to townsend appears to have been the case ten years after for in the year      the minister of the finance in his circular letter sent through all the provinces urged the collectors to double diligence in collecting the taxes because the expenses of government were  0000000 of reals more than the revenue since that short period the revenue is increased and the last statement of mr eden our ambassador is  00000000 of reals or  000000 british and that now they have a surplus of revenue to discharge former debts  though the debts of this kingdom are not so great as those of france or england yet they amount to a very considerable sum and are of various kinds some ancient and some more recent the former date their origin from the revolt of the belgic provinces in      and a conflict of more than    years during which contracting a debt of  00000000 of dollars spain brought on such a derangement in her finances that she has ever since been in a crippled state when she has found herself engaged in a war the country exhausted by this long contest cried universally for peace and philip iii in   0  although he would not acknowledge the sovereignty of the new republic consented to a truce but his successor having other views provoked hostilities carried on a very expensive war and before he consented to the peace of munster and to the independency of the united provinces in      discovered that he had doubled the debt which therefore amounted to about  0000000 sterling  the principal creditors the genoese and other foreign merchants to whom as security for payment of the principal with interest government assigned certain portions of the revenue denominated juros because they passed like other property either by descent or transfer  these genoese and other foreign merchants being after the expulsion of the jews the chief farmers of the revenue were accused of innumerable frauds against the public and this both with the connivance and participation of the clerks and comptrollers of the treasury when their evil practices were brought to light they sold their juros to the natives yet frauds continued and thus administered the interest of the debt swallowed up the whole of the revenue  in order therefore to redeem these juros the tax called millones already spoken of was granted by the cortes yet the deficit continued in consequence of this many whose ancestors had purchased juros were happy to sell them at a loss of  0 per cent whilst the genoese and strangers still farmers of the revenue being purchasers paid them back for rent to government at par  the second class of public debts are those contracted by the emperor charles v in his rash war these amounted according to the abbe raynal to near   000000 sterling but the interest of this being then more than the whole revenue the state in the year      became bankrupt  at the death of charles ii and the accession of a new family public credit was restored and in less than half a century philip v availing himself of this reviving confidence contracted fresh engagements to the amount of near  000000 sterling at his death ferdinand vi his son and successor an equitable and pious prince terrified at so enormous a burden and hesitating between the fear of making the state support it and the scruple of depriving the creditors of their right assembled a junto composed of ministers bishops and lawyers and proposed to them the following question is a king obliged to pay the debts of his predecessors will it be believed that it was decided in the negative under pretense that the state was a patrimony of which the sovereign had but the temporary use and that he was answerable for no engagements but his own this decision equally contrary to reason justice and policy quieted the conscience of the monarch and legalized in his eyes that which was a real bankruptcy the payment of the debts of spain was entirely suspended  ferdinand vi carried his inconsiderate economy still further wholly employed in making savings he suffered every branch of administration to languish the army fortresses and colonies were neglected when charles iii ascended the throne in      he found in the royal coffers upwards of    000000 of livres the new sovereign more delicate in his scruples than his predecessor thought it incumbent on him to repair the fatal omission of ferdinand vi in      he paid six per cent of the capital due from philip v but beginning with his own subjects he put off foreigners until all the spanish debts should be discharged this was acting toward his subjects as a good father might toward his children but it was perhaps destroying all the sources of future foreign credit in modern times when war costs more money than men when great enterprises require frequently prodigious sums what state can supply its own wants spain continued for five years to pay six per cent in diminution of her capital debt in      the dividend was reduced to four per cent and in      the expenses of the state were so increased as to necessitate a suspension of further dividends an interruption which gave the finishing stroke to the credit of government they are still received in payment of first fruits but except in this and one or two other cases the claims of philip v are almost of no value they bear no interest and the entire liquidition of them if ever it should take place can only be considered as very distant  it is not but the spanish government perceives the inconvenience of depriving the possessors of these claims of their rights but the necessities of the state have not hitherto permitted it to adopt proper measures in      government endeavored with this view to open a loan of  0000000 of reals one of the conditions of the loan was that the claims upon philip v should be received to the amount of a third of the subscription this however did not raise the value of the claims so much as was expected the credit of states resembles the human body an instant may destroy either but much time is required to give them strength and maturity the loan which was supposed to be offered upon advantageous terms tempted but few persons to subscribe foreigners who would have been glad to have made advantage of their claims were deterred by the consideration that they must risk a capital double the sum they wished to recover the loan in fact recalled to their minds the loss they had sustained  the spanish nation is in general suspicious and does not resemble those which the spirit of stockjobbing keeps in continual fermentation far from being tempted by foreign speculations for the sake of greater gain it confines its confidence to the company of merchants at madrid known by the name of gremios of which we have already had occasion to speak the treasure of the gremios is a kind of public bank in which individuals may place their money at the moderate interest of two and a half and three per cent  the foundation of this confidence arises from the support given by government to the gremios and from the regularity observed by this society in paying the interest of the capital in their hands the government which has frequently had recourse to them in cases of necessity has long considered this bank as the chief pillar of the state  administration has however lately perceived that it could do without them during the late war in america spain being obliged to issue paper currency at different periods to the amount of between four and five millions sterling notwithstanding the high interest it bore and its being deemed lawful payment in all money transactions these bills were for a long time received with repugnance and the paper money issued by government was depreciated    per cent when m cabarrus by the institution of a national bank called the bank of s charles restored the public credit and saved the country  this bank is too singular in its history to be passed over in silence the principal object proposed was to establish a capital which should discount at four per cent per annum all bills drawn upon madrid this resource was moderate madrid not being properly a commercial city it was further held out that the profits of the realgiro a particular species of bank from which the court takes the money it has occasion to send abroad for the payment of ambassadors envoys consuls etc or for other purposes should be given to the national bank this likewise was but a weak resource the realgiro not paying more than two or three millions of livres annually  but the chief source of profit which m cabarrus proposed to open to the national bank was the victualling and furnishing of the army and navy for this they were to be allowed ten per cent commission for their trouble besides four per cent per annum on all the money they should advance besides this they were to have the exclusive privilege of exporting specie collecting from the merchant four per cent and three for the use of the bank no entail was to be valid against the demands of the bank such were the advantages held forth to subscribers  its first institution was to consist of   0000 shares at  000 reals each constituting a capital of  000000 sterling with liberty to add annually  000 shares for  0 years in order that there might not be one citizen of the spanish empire excluded from this beneficial enterprise  to create a confidence in the public the directors were not to enter into any speculation except where the king should give them a commission for foreign and distant commerce or to favor the agriculture and manufactures of the kingdom and to remove all occasions of jealousy they were to have no monopoly they were to receive at par and thereby to procure a circulation for the government paper  those who had property to purchase shares were not excluded from the profits which these shares might produce and according to the prospectus they seemed to be very promising besides the idle money to which an advantageous opening was to be given it was hoped that great part of that in the hands of the gremios which was at such a very low interest would be removed from their coffers to those of the national bank the surplus of the grants from cities and communities was also reckoned upon these were in the administration of the council of castille whence the national bank was to take them and make such use of them as should be most advantageous to the persons concerned in spain there are magazines of grain in most of the cities boroughs and villages and of these there are upwards of  000 their surplus is converted into money this also was an useless capital which the bank might employ hence it appears that great advantages were promised to every class of citizens it is not therefore astonishing that the minister adopted the project  this bank met with rough usage in its beginning but the indefatigable application of its projector supported by the good sense of count florida blanca overcame all difficulties and established it on a firm foundation the first year the bank divided nine and a half per cent and the second year a similar dividend was made besides an investment of   000000 of reals amounting to nearly as much more in the new philippine company  in may      the bank made a proposal the admission of which will furnish a new employment to its funds this was to undertake the completion of the canal which begins at the foot of the mountains of guadarama and terminates at the guadalquavir after crossing the center of spain it has offered to superintend the work receiving ten per cent commission and four per cent per annum for all the money they should expend this proposal has been accepted by government which will furnish the bank with another means of augmenting its profits and rendering itself advantageous to spain without endangering the funds  the placing money in this bank says bourgoanne i deem with impartial judges safe and advantageous not that the great dividends with which it has began are always to be expected the exportation of piastres will not in future be so beneficial as it was immediately after the peace but so long as the bank preserves that exclusive privilege and government shall confide to it the victualling and other supplies for the army and navy the principal source of its profits the subscribers may reckon upon an interest of from five to six per cent  it may here be proper to speak of the quantity of money circulating in spain the amount of which is very difficult to come at as great part of that struck in the indies passes clandestinely into europe it is therefore only from loose calculation and the opinions of some wellinformed merchants says bourgoanne that i have estimated it at  0000000 of double piastres or about    00000 sterling it will perhaps be thought extraordinary that spain in possession of most of the gold and silver mines in the world and annually coining  0000000 of piastres should be reduced to so moderate a sum of circulating money especially when it is recollected that in the reign of charles v it contained almost all the gold and silver in europe and what is still more valuable possessed in the productions of its soil and industry the means of subsisting without the aid of any other nation  in less than a century has this kingdom fallen from such a state of splendor to what is this so rapid and total a revolution to be attributed to the abundance of the precious metals which have increased the price of manufactures and the wages of workmen to the great depopulation occasioned by the numerous emigrations to america the great destruction of men in the long wars at a distance from the frontiers and the expulsion of the moors and the jews it may also be more particularly attributed to the ruinous wars undertaken by philip ii against the low countries and which from the year      to the truce in      cost upwards of  00000000 of piastres but every thing announces that spain is rising from her own ashes and will soon be industriously employed in cultivating her soil and animating her manufactures weary of pursuing a passive commerce she will soon cease to lessen her current coin by paying foreign industry and sending every year the greatest part of her money into foreign countries for foreign produces  the population of spain in      appears to have been  0     0 souls such are the last returns to government in the year    0 the population by the same authority was stated to be   0  0  from thence it would seem that in    years the population had increased nearly  000000 of inhabitants in like manner the number of souls in      were     000 from whence it might be inferred since that period she had advanced in population more than   00000 but according to ustariz the returns to government are not always just and the people to lessen their contributions of men and money conceal their numbers and make false returns this however is no conclusive argument against the increased population of spain for it is reasonable to infer that the people have concealed their numbers in the same proportion in each of the returns  now if from the number above stated as the population of      we deduct        these being out of the peninsula and inhabiting either the islands or the coasts of africa we shall have for the remainder   0     and if we allow the area of spain to be        square miles we shall find    persons nearly to a square mile this if compared with russia is respectable if with france below mediocrity in the former they reckon five to a square mile in the latter     england comes in between france and spain but spain if properly cultivated and wellgoverned might be the first in europe not excepting holland which to its wise and equitable laws is indebted for a population amounting to     on a square mile bernardo ward who was in the employment of the spanish government admits that   000 square leagues of the richest land are left uncultivated and that  000000 of the people are unemployed  all are agreed that spain in more distant periods was much better peopled than at present it may be useful therefore to trace the circumstances which have contributed to depress this oncepowerful nation and desolate at least comparatively one of the richest countries in europe  in the year      the plague broke out with more than common violence at almeria and for three years ravaged spain to such an extent that many cities were left almost without inhabitants and through the whole peninsula it reduced the population to onethird of what it was previous to that event subsequent to this cruel misfortune spain has been repeatedly laid waste by pestilential fevers introduced from africa or dating their origin from some preceding famine in      more than  00000 perished in the southern provinces such a vast extent of territory as this peninsula contains having no communication either by roads or canals divided formerly into a multitude of independent kingdoms and at a subsequent period into provinces each exacting heavy duties on the introduction of grain into them must often have felt distress for want of bread in fact one province has been reduced to the extremity of famine whilst others have been ruined by abundance in      wheat sold in seville as high as    shillings and threepence the bushel and the year following so low as    pence it was not till the year      that corn was permitted to pass from one province to another the consequence of famine as is well known is pestilence the ordinary diet of the peasants predisposes them to receive infection and the practice of the physicians in prescribing venesection indiscriminately to all their patients does but increase the malady  from all these circumstances concurring few countries have sustained such losses by epidemic diseases and pestilential fevers  another cause of depopulation is that for more than seven centuries from the year     to      spain was harrassed by incessant struggles and the heart of that divided country contending for dominion these struggles did not cease till the marriage of ferdinand and isabella united the crown of arragon and castille and the conquest of granada put a period to the empire of the moors  in      columbus opened a new channel for spanish ambition and gave beginning to endless emigrations by the discovery of america previous to this period the nobility resided mostly on their estates and when not engaged in war gave themselves up to the arrangement of their domestic concerns without accumulating treasures many were able to conduct   or  000 soldiers into the field but when they had seen the gold and silver of peru and mexico they became restless and impatient to obtain employment in those countries and neglected the flower yet more certain means of obtaining wealth by the improvement of their lands the people likewise emigrated in such numbers to america that the maritime provinces suffered very essentially by their loss  emigrations if regular and in due proportion do not weaken the parent state but when sudden and carried beyond certain bounds tend to impoverish and depopulate a country the former may be observed in the highlands of scotland in switzerland and many parts of germany the latter was visible on the first discovery of america and has ever since been severely felt  from the accession of charles i of spain but the vth of germany in   0  spain was engaged in war with short intervals for two centuries more thereby exhausting the treasures of america and wasting the blood of its most adventurous subjects in italy germany flanders portugal and france only to gratify the ambition of its sovereigns and extend the bounds of their unjust dominion  the immediate successors of charles having spain naples sicily sardinia milan franche compte and    provinces in the low countries besides portugal and boundless territories in north and south america such an immense and dispersed empire weak in proportion to its extent perpetually consumed both men and money without the possibility of solidly uniting such distant and discordant provinces under one command  the cause however usually assigned for the depopulation of spain as if it were the only one is the expulsion of the moors to this may be added the previous expulsion of the jews to the number of  00000 who were banished by ferdinand and isabella in gratitude to heaven for the conquest of granada  consequent to the expulsion of the moors their depredations along the whole extent of the coast washed by the waters of the mediterranean rendered the most fertile parts of spain unsafe and the produce precarious for the last century the number of spanish captives at algiers has usually been about  0000 and their ransom reckoned one with another l  0 at which it has been estimated amounts to  000000 and an half sterling with such premiums for the ransom of their captives these pirates found ample supplies for the equipment of their galleys  no country ever invented a more ruinous system of finance or one less friendly to manufactures and commerce the tax of    per cent on all commodities both on the raw materials and on the same when manufactured as often as the property changes hands rated not according to the prime cost but the selling price is almost sufficient of itself to occasion a general stagnation this effect is visible in castille whilst in catalonia and in the province of arragon where philip v exchanged this oppressive tax for the equivalent industry prevails and manufactures flourish the millones likewise being a tax on provisions tends to enhance the price of labor and thereby indirectly forms an obstacle to foreign commerce  convents also are by no means favorable to population these in spain are      containing near  00000 monks and nuns but the persons bound to celibacy by vows are little short of  00000 the university of toledo in a memorial delivered to philip iii in the beginning of the   th century complains that not one tenth of the usual marriages took place and particularly states that whilst commerce flourished it had been usually said he who has a trade has the best benefice but that now all parents dreading the poverty and wretchedness attached to trade were inclined to breed up their children nuns monks and parish priests or exposed them to perish in their infancy some of the best spanish writers on political economy says count campomanes in his education populaire have declared against multiplying convents and the cortes with the consent of philip iv determined in the last century that no more should be built but as general opinion is more powerful than law this resolution of the cortes was never carried into effect  numerous festivals remarks the above writer contribute to depopulate a country benedict xiv lessened the number in his temporal estates and recommended a similar reduction to his clergy in consequence of this they have now only    general festivals not including the special festivals of each parish and of the religious houses which in every city swell the number of unproductive days if to these are added the bullfeasts and the mondays claimed by all classes of workingpeople for their diversion the number of days in which work is done will be reduced very considerably besides this a fresh reduction must be made from their time because the working hours are seldom more than six  prevalence of pasture also tends to depopulate a country the same quantity of land which in wild pasture would require the labor of one family when tilled gives employment to  0 or even twice that number in spain ever since the year    0 when the plague carried off twothirds of the inhabitants the laws of the mesta have set the ploughman and the shepherd at variance and prevented each from deriving the least advantage from the other so that  000000 sheep under the sanction of a peculiar code not only fail to enrich the lands on which they feed but effectually prevent its cultivation independent of the merino flock many of the great landlords have suffered villages to go to ruin and let their estates to graziers  the want of yeomenry and substantial tenants is another obstacle to population the distracted and divided state of the country during the dominion of the moors made it necessary for the peasants to seek refuge in the cities or associate in villages for their mutual defense for this reason independent farms detached and distant from a town are seldom or ever seen in the southern provinces of spain in the year      when the plague had spread desolation through the country many towns and villages were suffered to go to ruin and decay to this event has been attributed the extensive territories of innumerable towns many of which are from ten to    miles diameter and therefore too far distant from the habitation of the farmer to admit of cultivation adjoining to the village may be observed vines olives figs and grain all beyond is desolation  previous to the recovery of the southern dominion from the moors many of the nobility could bring into the field   or  000 vassals but then as most of these were little less than independent sovereigns the prince was obliged to court and allure them to his standard by the hope of making conquests for themselves hence they acquired towns cities and villages with extensive districts  in succeeding periods the great nobility taking advantage of the minority of the sovereign extorted considerable grants from the kings demesne in addition to those they already possessed all which they transmitted to posterity by intermarriages many of these possessions have been united three great lords the dukes of osuna alba and medinacoeli cover almost the whole province of andalusia and the last of these claims by inheritance the greatest part of catalonia  such vast possessions passing by entail are not friendly to population more especially as the proprietor never resides upon his estates and being frequently in embarrassed circumstances is little able to make improvements for his heirs  the national prejudice against the settlement of strangers in spain may likewise be added among the desolating causes in      strangers were allowed to be naturalized and either to take farms or practice their mechanic arts provided they did not settle within  0 leagues of the coast in      this privilege was extended to merchants who were permitted to settle in any of the ports for want of intercourse with other nations all the arts sciences and manufactures appear to be at least a century behind the rest of europe in the year      an author of high reputation in his discourse on the population of spain asserted that   0000 strangers spread themselves over the country and by their industry carried out of the kingdom annually near  000000 sterling he therefore recommends alms to be given to strangers but not employment and relates the history of a spanish farrier as an example to be followed this man went to paris to work at his trade but being threatened with death if he attempted to exercise his art in that metropolis he retired to bourdeaux hoping there to find a more hospitable reception but in that place they cut off one of his arms that he might no longer work and rob the french farrier of his bread  persecution too is a powerful cause of depopulation it were endless to enumerate the advantages a community derives from toleration as without an established religion the poor would be neglected and in danger of losing all knowledge of the deity so without a toleration according to townsend there could be no competition and therefore little scope for emulation without which zeal he says would languish and morals decay  the gold and silver of america say the spanish writers of eminence instead of animating the country and promoting industry have had an opposite effect and produced in the end weakness poverty and depopulation the wealth arising from industry resembles the copious yet tranquil stream which passing silently along enriches the whole extent of country through which it flows but the treasures of the new world like a swelling torrent were seen were heard were felt and were admired yet their first operation was desolating and laying waste the spot on which they fell the price of labor provisions and manufactures bore proportion to the quantity of circulating cash the consequence of which was that all the manufactures went to ruin and decay every thing was imported from abroad and till the present century spain purchased all her men of war with masts and cordage from holland rigging from france ammunition from england and even her galleys from the genoese  among other causes of depopulation count campomanes reckons likewise corporations in spain these are injurious to a degree scarce to be conceived in all the trading companies or gremios religious fraternities are formed who make laws sit in judgment on offenders and in many cases claim exemption from the common tribunals of the country  these corporations which are established in cities banish by their oppressive laws all the mechanic arts from towns and villages in the cities they limit the numbers in every branch of business and go so far as to assign the distance between shop and shop under pretense that two shops vending the same commodity must not be so near as to interfere with each other in other cities they assemble all the mechanics of the same profession in one street particularly silversmiths the pretext for which then is that the magistrate may more easily inspect their work and see that the various articles in which they traffic are of a proper standard  in many cases the various gremios bear hard upon each other the carpenter must not employ his industry on any other wood but deal nor must he invade the province of the turner the turner must work only in wood and not presume to touch either ivory or metals the wheeler must not however qualified extend his art beyond the appointed bounds so as to encroach on the coachmaker who is equally restrained from making or mending either cart or waggonwheel the barber may shave draw teeth or bleed but he must not make wigs it is the same with shopkeepers as with mechanics they must confine themselves to their proper articles and under no pretense may the manufacturers open magazines to sell by retail  the incorporated fraternities in the kingdoms of castille and arragon are       and their expenses amount to near   000000 of reals this revenue is not consumed as with us in feasting but in procuring masses either for departed spirits or for the benefit of the fraternity in which each individual has an equal interest for this reason these communities enjoy the protection of the ecclesiastical courts to which in cases of necessity they frequently appeal  the chartered corporations claim their privileges by royal grant and on this plea resist a reformation not considering as campomanes remarks the essential condition of these grants that nothing therein contained shall be to the prejudice of others or injurious to the citizens at large  similar to the former causes as checking manufactures and thereby diminishing the population of a country may be reckoned sumptuary laws baron montesquieu himself applies this remark to spain and facts certainly vindicate the justice of his observations for had their dress been left to the whim and caprice of the inhabitants the more delicate manufactures which are now lost would by the certainty of a ready market have been retained among them  with so many subsisting causes of depopulation in vain did philip iv in      offer a premium for marriage in vain did he grant all the privileges of nobility to all new married men for four years in vain did he deprive the nobles of their privileges if unmarried at the age of    and offer all the exemptions belonging to nobility for life to the father of six children  should however the people take advantage of the present crisis to assert their freedom should they happy in possessing one of the richest countries upon earth contract the bounds of their unwieldy empire and confine their views within the limits of their own peninsula cherish industry abolish their monastic orders lessen the number of their festivals establish an agrarian law and strike off the fetters by which their commerce has been bound we may venture to affirm that no country of the same extent would be more populous more wealthy or more powerful than spain  chap xxii army military orders and navy the spanish infantry consists of    regiments of two battalions each without including those of the spanish and walloon guards each containing   00 men in six battalions of these    regiments    are spanish two italian three flemish and four swiss white or blue is the color of their regimentals except one spanish and three irish dressed in red  these    battalions each of which ought to contain     men would make the spanish infantry amount to about  0000 men complete which is very far from being the case and it has been asserted though perhaps without foundation that spain would find it difficult to bring into the field  0000 effective men it is however certain that her infantry is not adequate to the great extent of her possessions since garrisons must be left in africa as well as several parts of her colonies in      it appears that spain had no less than    battalions out of europe and in         in america alone  the means of recruiting in spain are very confined the spanish people in general have a peculiar dislike to enlist in the infantry every regiment finds it difficult to procure men and they are obliged to beat up in those places where most dupes and libertines are assembled thus those who disturb its repose are appointed to its defense the soldiers of the french regiments impelled by their inconstancy take advantage of the neck of the pyrenees to go and engage themselves to spanish recruiters foreign regiments in the service of spain are particularly recruited at the expense of the french regiments thus all the inconvenience of the proximity of the respective garrisons is on the side of france and the court of madrid is by no means desirous of a cartel for exchanging deserters it was thought sufficient in      that each should agree to return the arms horses and baggage of the soldiers passing from one service to the other  another mode of recruiting the spanish army is that of the quintas a kind of drawing of militia different from that of france though it is there in use both for recruiting the army and the provincial regiments the ordinance of   0  enacts that for recruiting the regulars lots shall be drawn in each village to choose one person our of five but then the drawing of the militia is to be suspended this is no doubt the etymology of the word quintas as it frequently happens the word remains when the thing is changed the quintas at present do not require so great a number and as the people have on some occasions murmured at this mode of recruiting government resorts to this expedient only in the last extremity she had not recourse to it in the last war and the regiments employed at minorca and gibraltar were completed at the expense of those not in actual service  besides the    regiments of regular infantry spain has    of militia distributed in the provinces of the crown of castille these regiments are assembled only for one month in the year in the principal place of which they bear the name and then the officers and soldiers are paid at all other times they are dispersed in the villages and follow their respective occupations these regiments which all consist of one single battalion of   0 men except that of majorca which has two must always be complete as soon as a soldier of the militia dies deserts or is discharged lots are drawn in the village whence he was taken to replace him  the regiments of militia have a particular inspector their colonels are chosen as in england from among the most distinguished gentry of the district and their authority is very extensive over the men they have the power of inflicting punishments and there is no appeal from their sentences but to the king through the medium of a council of war few states in europe have so well regulated a militia the grenadiers of these regiments are in time of war united to the regular troops and enjoy among their fellow ctizens a reputation which their whole conduct during the last war justly merited  the spanish soldiers have long been justly renowned for their firm and persevering courage and the resolution with which they support labor fatigue and hunger of the officers it has been said but with what foundation we do not pretend to determine that their troops were not so well commanded as they ought to be spanish officers however have not the same means of forming themselves with the french most of their garrisons are solitary and illprovided without resource either for instruction or innocent pleasures the officers have not the privilege of the semestres or leave of absence for six months every year or every second year as in france neither can they but seldom obtain leave of absence to regulate their private affairs this unvaried and insipid life in the end absorbs the faculties and destroys activity or diverts the mind to improper objects it has besides the inconvenience of rendering the service less desirable and keeping from it those to whom a smaller fortune or liberal education offer other resources  the cavalry consists of    regiments not including the brigade of carbiniers raised in    0  of these regiments six are in blue four in red three in white and one in green  the dragoons form eight regiments of which one is in blue one in red and six in yellow each regiment of cavalry is composed of four squadrons which should contain   0 men were the regiments complete spain would have an army of   000 horse in time of peace the  00 men of which each regiment ought to be composed is reduced to   0 and of this number there are  0 men dismounted  this arrangement was made in      the result is that the cavalry is less agreeable than it would otherwise be to the spaniards because the new recruits remain three or four years on foot waiting their turn to have spare horses notwithstanding these defects the spanish cavalry may be reckoned among the finest in europe  the cavalry in spain is not so easily mounted as it might be supposed from the great celebrity of the spanish horses the breed is said to be degenerated this is attributed to the little care that has been taken to cross it and particularly to the great number of mules bred from some of the finest spanish mares  nature which has so liberally bestowed on spain all the necessaries and luxuries of life has been equally lavish in bestowing all the materials of which war composes the means of destruction she has given iron in abundance copper lead and saltpeter this country therefore need not be indebted to any other for the supply of its artillery with these destructive treasures  the spanish artillery is collected into one regiment composed of five battalions without including the cadets the corpse of engineers are separated from the artillery it consists of ten directors ten colonels  0 lieutenantcolonels  0 captains  0 lieutenants and as many sublieutenants in all   0 officers  according to some late regulations no person can become an officer without having been a cadet the military school first established at avila and since removed to port s mary is not so much intended to instruct students in the first elements of tactics as to cultivate the dispositions of officers who have the noble emulation of distinguishing themselves in the military profession nothing is omitted in this academy which may conduce to that end and it is perhaps the first institution of the kind in europe  the kings of spain have no more forgotten the declining years of military men than their youth there is a corpse of invalids in spain as well for officers as for soldiers but the    companies of which it is composed are distributed at madrid and in the provinces where they perform an easy duty those incapable of all service form another corpse of    companies  the uniforms in the spanish service says swinburne are ugly and ill made the soldiers abominably nasty in their clothes and their black greasy hair seldom dressed till very lately they were commonly in rags and often mounted guard with half a coat and almost bare breeched but now they are rather better clad and kept in a somewhat more decent trim  the pay of a soldier is five quartos and an half and    ounces of bread a day after    years service he has an increase of five reals a month after  0   reals and after    he may retire and receive a pezzetta per diem and be clothed as if he was still in actual service the pezzetta is four reals a real is about threepence english and a quarto not quite a halfpenny if the soldier remains  0 years in the army he is allowed the rank and pay of a subaltern officer every  0 months he receives new regimentals two shirts two stocks one pair of shoes two pair of stockings a cap and a hat  the rank of any officer may be known at first sight by a particular badge of distinction a captaingenerals dressuniform is blue embroidered with gold down the seams and three rows of embroidery on the sleeves a lieutenantgenerals has nothing on the seams and but two rows on the cuffs a mariscal de campo but one a brigadier has red cuffs with one row of silver embroidery on his coat a colonel has three narrow bindings on his sleeve of the color of his regimental button a lieutenant colonel two and a major one the mark of a captain is two epauletts of a lieutenant one on his right shoulder and of an ensign one on the left  the pay of a lieutenant is two pezzettas and a half per diem that of an ensign two as every thing is trebled in price since their pay was established it is become insufficient for the maintenance of the officers in the guards all subalterns must live upon their own fortune till they get a company which they may perhaps wait  0 years for  in spain there is no order of knighthood destined for the reward of military officers the late sovereign imposed on himself a law to confer on none but these the four military orders there are besides these other means of rewarding the old servants of the crown by pensions or employments analogous to their profession his beneficence also extends to their widows  the place of commandantgeneral of a province is an opening to general officers but obliges them to an almost perpetual residence for in spain bishops intendants governors and commanders reside where they are employed although the residence of the sovereign and the capital have the same temptations for ambition and dissipation as in other countries  all the commandants of provinces have the title of captain general which however must not be confounded with that of the first military rank they commonly receive but from an abuse the title of viceroy also which properly belongs to none but the commandant and those of the principal provinces of spanish america  we shall in this place take occasion to give some account of the military orders in spain most of which were created by the kings of spain during their continual wars against the moors many of them are become extinct which it may not be amiss just to notice before we speak of those which at present exist of these former are  the order of the green oak founded by ximenes that of the fleur de lys by sancho iv king of navarre and the order of the holy savior by alphonso vii king of arragon these short lived orders are scarce worth remembering but the order of the flambeau is more deserving notice having been instituted in    0 by berenzer last count of barcelona in favor of the women of tortosa as a recompense of the valor they had showed the year before in defense of their city against the moors the order no longer exists but the women of tortosa still enjoy several privileges granted at that time to their ancestors  the other nonexisting orders are those of truxillo of s mary of spain of the scarf this order perhaps gave rise to all our blue red and green ribbons it was founded by alphonso xii in      who gave it as a distinguishing badge a ribbon of the breadth of three fingers which the knights wore over the right shoulder ten years military service were a qualification to be admitted  there was likewise instituted in      the order of reason and what is singular proofs of nobility were required as a qualification to be admitted the distinguishing mark of the order was a folded little ensign hung to the mantle by means of a chain  the order of burgundy is also reckoned among those which have existed in spain having been instituted by charles v after his expedition to tunis in memory of that conquest the insignia of the order was a cross of burgundy composed of two knotty staffs above which was the word barbaria spain still bears the cross in her flag  among the existing orders of spain are those of alcantara calatrava santiago montesa the golden fleece and that of charles iii the order of alcantara was called the noble that of calatrava the gallant and that of santiago the rich  the first four of these orders were founded at the time of the crusades the king is grandmaster of them all the first three are distinguished by a red ribbon and the last by a green one these four orders have commanderies which are conferred by the king they were for a long time given to every class of persons who could bring the requisite proofs these orders have each lands in their possession to the amount of  00000 ducats and upwards of annual rent  the most distinguishing order in spain is that of the golden fleece founded by philip the good duke of burgundy and which the court of vienna continues to confer in concurrence with that of madrid although the former had renounced this prerogative by the treaty which terminated the great quarrel between philip v and the archduke the collar of the order consists of an alternate range of gold flints and steels with sparks of fire on all sides and a golden fleece pendent from it with this motto autre naurai charles the fifth instead of the collar permitted the knights to wear only a scarlet ribbon the number of knights of this order is very limited in spain and it is the order which of all those in europe has best preserved its ancient splendour  with respect to the order of charles iii this monarch having prescribed to himself an irrevocable law to bestow the other orders on none but military men an honorable distinction was wanting for the rest of his subjects this he supplied in      by creating a fifth order it is composed of two classes that of the great crosses and the simple knights the great crosses wear the great ribbon of the order sky blue edged with white their number should be limited to  0 this order is confined to the most eminent personages of the kingdom such as the ministers and some general officers distinguished either by their zeal or service  the simple knights were  00 in number each enjoying a pension of about l 0 this lesser order has since been bestowed on some persons in france not reckoned in the original number  proofs of nobility are necessary to this latter order as well as to the four military orders it is true nobility in most of the provinces in spain is not difficult to establish it is sufficient that he who aspires to this distinction proves himself and his ancestors to have lived nobly without having exercised any of the professions few in number which law and prejudice reckon vile he is then reputed a gentleman by descent hidalgo for in spain nobility by creation is unknown some humourists have observed that there are whole provinces of which the inhabitants are gentlemen nor is this any great exaggeration  philip v as we have already remarked ennobled all the biscayans and all the asturians believe they are descended from the ancient goths who took refuge in the mountains of asturia and are reputed noble on account of this honorable origin but there cannot be a more ridiculous absurdity than to suppose that two or  00000 men settled some years ago in a small province were all noble if all men measured five feet eight inches high the words giant and dwarf would be obliterated from the dictionary nobility necessarily supposes a more numerous class who are ignoble thus there are in biscay and asturia distinguished families in the opinion of the public who have made a great figure in the district wherein they reside either by their opulence or the places they have held and whatever may be the pretentions of obscure neighboring families the former affect a preeminence which these acknowledge by their homages so that if by chance they arrive at some employment of consequence they are less insolent and vain than most upstarts in other countries this may be particularly remarked in the lower ranks of the asturians and biscayans they have in their appearance something more haughty and are less humble in their homages they are not awed either by titles or riches a man in place is in their eyes a fortunate man who has won in the royal lottery in which they all have a ticket and may win in their turn and this prejudice says bourgoanne ridiculous as it may seem keeps them against meanness and degrading crimes  we shall now proceed to consider the navy of spain which is divided into three departments those of ferrol carthagena and cadiz  the first has real inconveniences from the unhealthiness of the climate the frequent rains which retard the operations in the port and its being so situated that no vessel can sail from it but with a particular wind  the department of carthagena has many advantages over that of ferrol the safety of its harbor is known by an old proverb among seamen who say there are but three good ports for vessels the months of june and july and the harbor of carthagena this safety extends to the arsenals and dockyards which being in a narrow place may according to the expression of the spanish sailors be locked by a single key carthagena therefore is the port where the greatest number of ships are built caulked and careened  the department of cadiz is however the most important of the three on account of its favorable situation for the departure of the fleets  the spanish navy is governed much in the same manner as that of france instead of viceadmirals there are captainsgeneral immediately after the captainsgeneral rank the lieutenantsgeneral who are at present    in number and the commodores    in the spanish navy there is likewise an intermediate rank between these and captains of vessels that of brigadier these are  0 in number of captains of ships there are   0 and of those of frigates      to acquire rank in the spanish navy it is necessary to have passed through the guard marine this corpse was established in      it consists of three companies each containing    cadets for whose instruction there is an academy composed of a director and eight professors  the officers of the navy are with respect to military rewards upon a footing with those of the army the viceroyalties governments of provinces or places in america are indiscriminately given to general officers of the army and those of the navy but the officers of the spanish navy have many other means of enriching themselves which render the kings favors less necessary  the sailors are classed as in france and divided into three departments the register of the classes make the whole amount to  0000 spain has also for the service of her ships of war a marine infantry composed of    battalions consisting of     men each which form a corpse of about   000 men  besides these there is a particular corpse of artillery of      men for whom there are theoretical and practical schools in each of the three departments  spain has also a society of pilots with schools of pilotage  in      the spanish navy consisted of only    ships of the line and about  0 frigates in    0 there were    ships of from    to     guns their number has since increased since the year      according to townsend their navy has been more than doubled in the summer of    0 their fleet of observation consisted of    ships of the line among which were four ships of     guns besides these they had six ships of the line stationed in the mediterranean and a strong fleet in america  it is a question worthy of discussion says the above writer whether spain ought to aim at being distinguished as a naval power should she adhere to the colonising system a powerful navy will be needful to protect her commeroe and secure her monopolies but then it should be enquired if the proportion of trade obtained beyond what she would enjoy if these distant provinces were free pays the expense of arming in times of peace or indemnifies her for all the commercial wars she may be engaged in to support her trade  the three divisions in europe of the navy of spain are not the only places where ships of war are built there are dockyards in the havannah and a fund of  00000 piastres was some time since established to carry on the works  spain and her colonies might furnish her navy with all the shiptimber necessary for that purpose there are great quantities in the mountains of asturia and navarre and particularly in the pyrenees on the side of arragon and catalonia there is a species of pine more solid and durable than oak the plain of cuba contains many cedars although it has been thought exhausted by the quantities drawn from the country adjacent to the coast in those of cumana there is timber likewise fit for shipbuilding but spain has not derived all the advantages she might have done from these resources and constantly depends on the northern states at least for a supply of masts from the account given to the public by the bank of s charles for the year      it appears that upwards of   00000 reals were paid that year for masts alone imported from the north they are still nearer the time of being independent of other powers for the hemp necessary for their navy this they received for many years from the north but at present most of the cordage cables and sailcloth used in spain are made from hemp grown in the country  the spaniards have also adopted from the english the method of sheathing the bottom of their men of war with copper but for want of knowing how to prepare the copper from mexico they have hitherto imported all their sheets of that metal from trieste and sweden  all these circumstances prove that spain possesses within herself every thing necessary to her navy and that after having long neglected these benefactions of nature she now makes successful efforts to render it independent of other nations  chap xxiii the bullfights the bullfights principally seem to be some remains of barbarism in the spaniards but at the same time they are more susceptible of apology these combats to which the spanish nation has the strongest attachment though highly repugnant to the delicacy of the rest of europe are considered by the spaniards as means of preserving in the nation the energy by which it is characterised for my part says bourgoanne though i wish to respect a taste by no means in unison with my own i have never been able to comprehend what relation there is to strength and courage in a spectacle where those present are exposed to no danger and in which the actors prove by the rarity of accidents that the hazards they run are not of a nature to excite much concern whatever may be said to the contrary says the above writer accidents are very rare the cavaliers who are thrown sometimes receive contusions but during almost four years that i was present at their bullfights i knew but one that died of his wounds a priest however provided with the viaticum and holy oils is always present in a kind of latticed box a precaution notwithstanding its inutility that has been kept up merely by the force of custom  the price of admission varies very much according as the places are covered or exposed in the sun or in the shade a box for the day which will conveniently accommodate eight or ten people in the shade will cost l     s but in the sun only half that sum and between both l    s fashionable people take a box a seat if covered in the shade and in the front bench costs   s   d for the day but a back seat in these covered benches on the sunny side of the theater is not quite half that sum the cheapest seat for the day exposed to all the inclemency of the weather to rain if it should rain and to the overwhelming heat of the summers sun is something more than   s   d  the stated expenses are enormous at madrid they are calculated at from three to l 00 the persons who fight the bulls receiving from three to l   each the average receipts are stated at near l 00 the balance forms the principal funds for the support of the general hospital  bullfights are mostly given in summer because spectators may then remain in the open air and in that season of the year the bulls are more vigorous there are  0 benches round the circle and that only which is most elevated is covered the boxes are in the upper part of the edifice in some cities as in valladolid where there are no particular places set apart for the combat the great square is converted into a theater for the purpose the balconies of the different stories are continued across the ends of the streets which there terminate the sight of the people of every class assembled round the square impatiently expecting the signal of battle and exhibiting in their countenance every sign of joy has in it something interesting if not pleasing  the exhibition begins by a kind of procession round the square in which the champions make their appearance as well those on horseback as those on foot after them come two alguazils gravely advancing in wigs and black robes who go to the governor for an order to begin the signal is immediately given the animal until then shut up in a kind of cabin the door of which opens into the circle is let out  the bull on his appearance is received and stunned with the cries and shouts of the people he has first to combat with the horsemen picadorres who clothed after the ancient manner of the spaniards wait for him with long lances this exercise which requires address strength and courage has nothing in it degrading formerly the first nobility did not disdain to take a part in it at present even some hidalgos solicit the honor of fighting on horseback and are sometimes previously presented to the people under the auspices of a patron who is generally one of the principal persons of the court the bull without being provoked frequently attacks them which when it happens gives the spectators a high opinion of his courage but if the animal is pacific disconcerted and cowardly runs round the circle avoiding his persecutors murmurs and hissings resound throughout the theater all those within whose reach he passes load him with blows and execrations it seems as if he were a common enemy who had a great crime to expiate or a victim whose sacrifice is of consequence to all the people if nothing can rouse his courage he is judged unworthy of being tormented by men and the repeated cries of petros petros bring on him new enemies  great dogs are then let loose upon him who seize him by the neck and ears the animal now finds the use of his natural weapons the dogs thrown up in the air fall stunned and sometimes lacerated upon the ground but they rise renew the combat and commonly overpower their adversary who thus perishes ignobly if he presents himself with a good grace the first act of the tragedy belongs to the combatants on horseback this is the most animated but the most disgusting part of the whole the animal then falls furiously upon the innocent horse and generally gores his sides and throws him and his rider on the ground  the latter then is in imminent danger until the combatants on foot called chulos come to his assistance and provoke the bull by shaking before him stuffs of different colors but it is not without danger to themselves that they save the dismounted horseman the bull sometimes pursues them and they then have need of their utmost agility they frequently escape him by letting fall the stuff which is their only weapon and upon which the fury of the deceived animal exhausts himself but it sometimes happens he is not thus to be imposed upon and the champion has no other resource than leaping over the barrier six feet high which forms the interior of the circle in some places there are two barriers but where there is but one the bull makes efforts to leap it which he sometimes accomplishes the alarm of the nearest spectators may easily be imagined and their precipitation in retiring and crowding upon the upper benches becomes more fatal to them than the fury of the animal who finding himself hampered in the narrow and uneven space rather thinks of saving himself than satisfying his vengeance except in these cases which are rare the bull returns to the charge  when it has been judged he is sufficiently tormented by the combatants on horseback these withdraw and leave him to the champions on foot called banderillos who meet him and the moment he attacks them stick into him two by two a banderilla ornamented with little streamers of stained paper the fury of the bull is redoubled he roars and his vain efforts render more acute the darts which have been lodged in him this last torment gives a fine opportunity for the display of the agility of his new adversaries  when the vigor of the bull appears almost exhausted and the blood gushes from every wound the president then gives the signal for his death which is announced by the sound of drums and trumpets the matador advances and is seen alone in the circle in one hand he holds a long knife in the other a kind of flag which he waves before his adversary thus together they stop and observe each other the impetuosity of the bull is several times avoided by the agility of the matador and the pleasure of the spectators rendered more lively by their suspense sometimes the animal remains immovable he scrapes the ground with his feet and seems to meditate vengeance the bull in this situation and the matador who discovers his intention and carefully observes his slightest motion form a picture which an able pencil might not disdain to delineate at length the matador gives the fatal blow and if the animal immediately falls the triumph of the conqueror is celebrated by a thousand exclamations but if the blow be not decisive their murmurs are not less numerous the matador whose address was about to be extolled to the skies is considered as a clumsy butcher he instantly endeavors to recover from his disgrace and disarm the severity of his judges at last he gives a better directed blow the animal vomits streams of blood and struggling with death staggers and falls while his conqueror becomes intoxicated with the applause of the people the bull is then tied by the horns and ignominiously dragged from the circle he has just honored leaving nothing but the traces of his blood and the remembrance of his exploit which is soon effaced by the appearance of his successor on each of the days dedicated to these feasts are sacrificed at least at madrid six bulls in the morning and    in the afternoon the names of the combatants of each are previously announced in the public prints  the day on which these bullfights are celebrated is a day of rejoicing for the whole district and for ten or    leagues round the artist who can scarce provide for his existence has always a surplus to expend on this spectacle whatever they may have been in former times says swinburne they are certainly but a poor exhibition at present though the crowds of people assembled in a circle and agitated in a most tumultuous manner form an interesting and curious spectacle none of the royal family ever appear at these favorite amusements of the spanish nation the nobility no longer pique themselves in these rough exercises and the fair condescend to yield up their hearts and persons to those that have given no proofs of their prowess but in combats of a softer nature  the reigning monarch who endeavors to polish the manners of his subjects has confined the number of bullfights to those of which the produce serves to the support of some charitable institution the combats by this means rendered less frequent will perhaps lose by degrees a part of their attraction till circumstances shall permit them to be entirely abolished  a description of the kingdom of portugal from baretti fielding and others chap i country climate mountains rivers etc this country was formerly called lusitania but its boundaries then were very different from what they are at present the name of portugal is by some thought to signify portus gallus or portus gallorum from the great number of french who came to the city of porto on the river douro to assist the christians against the moors others with more probability derive it from a town on the river douro by the ancients called cale but by the moderns changed to gaya opposite to this place some of the inhabitants afterward built a new town with a harbor and gave it the name of portucale or the harbor of cale which by uninterrupted prosperity proved the origin of the present flourishing city of porto and from hence the whole country has received the name of portugal  this kingdom which is the most western part of europe is bounded on the south and west by the atlantic ocean and on the north and east by spain its length from valencia the most northern town to sagnes the most southern near cape s vincent is about  00 miles and its greatest breadth from peniche a seaport in estremadura to salvaterra on the frontiers of spain is about  00 miles  the ancient inhabitants of this country were the turdetani the carthaginians and romans successively possessed lusitania as it was then called the latter being driven out by the suevi who did not enjoy it long they being in their turn conquered by the goths who kept possession of this country and spain till they were driven out by the moors it was afterward taken from them by the christians of gothic extraction  the climate of portugal is much more temperate than that of spain although with some variation in the different provinces the northern parts experience a kind of painful cold in winter chiefly owing to the heavy rains which fall in that season in the southern parts of portugal the summer heats are very violent both winter and summer however are very supportable cooling seabreezes refreshing the air during the latter season and the spring is extremely delightful  this country is in many parts mountainous from the mountains issue several streams and small rivers which fertilize the valleys and fields and either join the greater rivers in their course or discharge themselves separately into the sea the largest and principal of these are the following  the minho having its source in gallicia and emptying itself into the western or atlantic ocean not far from the town of caminha  the lima by the ancients called also lethe or the river of forgetfulness the turduli and celtae after losing their general settled on the banks of this river as if they had totally forgot their own country this also takes its source in gallicia falling into the sea below viana  the douro at the mouth of which stands the city of oporto so famous for its red wine the source of this river is in old castille the waters of it are said formerly to have contained so much gold that john iii had a scepter made from the gold found in it  the tagus has its source in the frontiers of arragon this is the largest and principal river in the whole kingdom in portugal it is joined by several rivers widening greatly toward its mouth so as to form several islands and a considerable harbor at lisbon a little beyond which it discharges itself into the sea in some places it overflows and increases the fertilty of the adjacent country this river also affords gold  the guadiana in latin the anas rises in new castille and entering bagadoz in portugal loses itself in the sea near ayrmonte and castro maxim its name signifies the river anas guadi in the moorish tongue denoting a river  all these rivers abound in fish and the three principal the douro the tagus and the guadiana divide the kingdom into three parts  the most remarkable mountains are the sierra d estrella and the rocky mountain of cintra the former called by the ancients mons herminius lies between the provinces of beires and tralos montes on the top of this mountain are two large lakes one of which is said to be unfathomable and is supposed to have a communication with the sea from wrecks of ships having been found in it and from its water being always rough and agitated when the adjoining ocean is so cinta called by the ancients promontorium lunae or the mountain of the moon is situated upon a point of land five leagues to the westward of lisbon and called by the english sailors the rock of lisbon on this promontory is a monastery hewn out of the solid rock when we came in view of this mountain says barretti i was told by one of the sailors it was the custom to duck every person in the sea on his first sight of this rock except he paid forfeit for some other to undergo the operation in his stead  on the highest pinnacle of this mountain the ancients built a temple dedicated to the moon under the appellation of cynthia from whence comes the modern appellation of cintra and there is certainly not a spot on the globe where astronomical observations might be made to more advantage whether we consider the great height and serenity of the atmosphere or the extensive horizon joined to the most commanding and unbounded prospect of the atlantic ocean  upon this mountain are the remains of a palace belonging to the moorish kings there are still three of its halls to be seen the ceilings are divided into small compartments having animals painted on them one ceiling contains nothing but swans another nothing but stags and the third nothing but magpies neither are the attitudes varied each swan has a golden chain round his neck every stag supports a coat of arms on his back and the magpies have the words per ben written over them upon the adjacent hills are a great number of villas belonging to the portuguese nobles and the english merchants not far from the base of the mountain is a spot of ground of about three miles in length and one in breadth entirely planted with oranges and lemons whose flowers when they are in bloom perfume a vast tract of country it is called the valley of collares and compared to the garden of eden from its luxuriance  the mountains of portugal are some of the most barren on the continent except toward the base where they are in general well planted with vineyards which yield great quantities of excellent wine some mineral springs have been discovered in this country but they are not made any use of excepting the baths of caldas in estremadura which are famed for their virtues in venereal cases though these baths are in so much repute the accommodations to be met with at them are but very indifferent they lie    leagues north of lisbon  although the soil be very fruitful so much is agriculture neglected here that above half the country lies waste and the inhabitants are supplied with a great part of their corn by importation portugal however abounds in excellent wine and oil the greatest part of the oil is made in the province of alentejo olive trees thrive better near the sea than up in the country here is also great plenty of fine honey and consequently of wax the best honey which is found in the fields is almost of a white color and of a most agreeable flavor and the wild honey here is more agreeable to the taste than that of other countries portugal also produces abundance of lemons pomegranates oranges figs raisins almonds chestnuts and other fine fruits it has likewise variety of sea and river fish and large quantities of salt their sweet oranges are said to be some of the best in europe as portugal is not without excellent pastures the graziery in some places is very considerable and an uncommon number of sheep and cattle may occasionally be seen but in general it is at so low an ebb that the greatest part of their oxen come from spain their horses are not large but very fleet the portuguese however breed more asses than horses the latter being clandestinely imported from spain there is scarce any country where more marmalade is made both of the white and red sort as likewise great quantities of odoriferous waters  chap ii of the cities the whole kingdom contains six provinces    civdades or cities and     villas or smaller towns the number of inhabitants may be pretty nearly computed and is calculated at  000000 of people of its cities we shall notice lisbon and operto which are the two principal ones  lisbon the metropolis of the kingdom extends from east to west along the river tagus near its influx into the sea resembling an amphitheatre and containing within its circuit seven mountains the length of the whole city is indeed little short of two miles and its breadth is inconsiderable the valleys of these mountains form streets of above a mile in length but most of them are very narrow ill paved and dirty and many of them also steep and troublesome  though lisbon says fielding in his account of this city is said to be built on the same number of hills as ancient rome yet these do not all appear from the water on the contrary one sees from plan of the city of lisbon references   royal exchange

rock with buildings arising one above another and that in so steep and almost perpendicular a manner that they all seem to have but one foundation  as the houses churches convents etc are large and all built with white stone they look very beautiful at a distance but as you approach nearer all idea of beauty vanishes while surveying the prospect of this city which bears so little resemblance to any in england a reflection occurred to me that if a man was suddenly to be removed from palmyra hither and should take a view of no other city in how glorious a light would the ancient architecture appear to him and what desolation and destruction of arts and sciences would he conclude had happened between the several aeras of these cities  all the streets says costigan laid out and built since the earthquake in      are strait regular and mostly spacious running at right angles to each other but the houses are in general too high in proportion to the width of the streets for which reason the falling of the houses upon the first great shock of any future earthquake must inevitably bury under their ruins those who shall be able to escape into the streets  to form some connected idea of its situation imagine an extent of shore upon a spacious river capable of receiving every kind of shipping and pouring its waters immediately into the atlantic with regard to its local situation far preferable to every other on the continent of europe for the most extended traffic with the whole continent of america  lisbon says twiss is pretty nearly in the same ruinous state it was in after the earthquake in      there are many new buildings carrying on but the streets are yet in various places stopped up with the ruins occasioned by that calamity this city is built on seven steep hills and the streets are very badly paved with small sharp stones which renders walking almost impracticable and at night as there is no kind of light in these streets it would not be prudent for a stranger to walk out alone the houses are generally two stories high sometimes three with no other chimney but that of the kitchen they are built of a kind of half marble with iron balconies and wooden latices to the ground floor but they are not remarkable for architecture  the new streets are built on the spot where the royal palace stood before it was demolished by the earthquake on each side of these new streets is a footpath elevated somewhat above the pavement and defended from carriages by stone posts these houses are four and five stories high the exchange is finished and is near the river with porticos under which the merchants assemble this building forms one side of an intended square in the midst of which is to be placed an equestrian statue of the late king the pedestal is of a single stone and required  0 yoke of oxen to drag it from the quarry about two miles distant from the spot where it now is  the kings palace stands on the river and is both spacious and convenient on the east side of it is a large square for the bull fights and not far from it are the naval magazines the arsenal is a very large building near it stands the fish market which is superior to those in holland it is plentifully supplied with fish most of them unknown in england but with neither salmon nor cod the former of which the inhabitants procure from oporto by men employed for the purpose who perform the journey in four days on foot taking the shortest route without regarding the common roads and deliver each fish at lisbon for a moidore the johndory is to be met with larger here than in the western coast of england as likewise are red mullets the conger eels are very large and the scates will sometimes measure seven feet from the head to the extremity of the tail near this market are also sold vegetables fruits tortoises monkies parrots and brazil birds  the churches of lisbon are in general very fine but that belonging to the patriarchate is of astonishing magnificence the very ornaments and plate in it containing the treasure of several brasil fleets the pomp assumed by the patriarch on festivals surpasses even that of the pope if we except only the college of cardinals  the convents and colleges are fifty in number    for monks and    for nuns the garden of the convent das necessidades immediately under the hill of buenos aynes is a very fine one and is open to the decent part of the public in one of the suburbs of lisbon is a convent over the door of which the arms of england and portugal are hewn in stone party per pale the lion and unicorn for supporters with the royal crown on the top one of these convents is called the english nunnery because no person is admitted into it who is not born of english parents any lady left destitute in england and willing to devote herself to chastity and retirement need not fear the approaches of real want for the remainder of her life if she once gets admittance here the number of the nuns amounts to    or    and it is the chief anxiety of this little community to keep the number complete lest government should introduce any portuguese among them which might destroy the harmony of the society  the king allows them such a sum as furnishes them all the necessaries of life the minute superfluities called by the french douceurs so indispensable to render existence comfortable are left to their own industry these they procure partly by work and partly by trifling presents often returned with liberality  whoever can speak english be he catholic or protestant has a kind of right to visit them at any hour of the day and all their visitors are treated by them with such endearing kindness that their parlatory is scarce ever empty  nuns in all countries are soft and obliging speakers but these says baretti are the softest and most obliging that ever i met with not a syllable issued from their lips that was not dictated by modesty and meekness humility and benevolence their virtue is to all appearance without the least alloy but were they in reality different from what they appear still the strong appearance of their innocence and goodness is irresistibly attracting  baretti relates an anecdote of the abbess of this nunnery lady hill which deserves to be recorded as showing what fidelity to an onerous engagement was found in a female breast this lady took the veil here from her circumstances perhaps not permitting her to make a more agreeable choice soon after a large estate in ireland devolved to her as next of kin by the death of a relation who died intestate  to get possession of this estate without her going to ireland was thought difficult and subject to much inconvenience her case therefore was represented to the patriarch who alone had the power to dispense with her vow of constant confinement and the patriarch by no means a rigid bigot upon a simple promise of returning gave her leave to secularize her dress and depart she did so went to ireland took possession of the estate and found herself at once in a condition to live at ease and even in splendor in her native country  the temptation of staying where she was it must be allowed was almost irresistible especially when it is added that she was handsome and not yet    however if she was tempted she was tempted in vain for she sold the estate as speedily as she could and faithful to her vow and her promise hastened back to the nunnery with the money which she laid out in such a manner as contributed much to the ease and convenience of her beloved community this was done by a woman would any friar in similar circumstances have behaved so nobly and returned to his less heavy fetters after so lucky an escape her companions struck with admiration as well as gratitude chose her immediately for their superior and never after ceased to pay her the veneration so indisputably due to her unshaken virtue  there is a theater in this city for italian operas the principal female singer in which says twiss appeared daily on the stage bedecked with jewels to the amount of   or  000 pounds the other theater is for portuguese plays there are four rows of boxes and    boxes in each row the italian house is nearly of the same size the seats in the pit are appropriated solely to the men the admittance money to the opera is something more than halfacrown  the british factory have two long rooms here in which they assemble twice a week during the winter to dance and play at cards any british stranger who does not intend to reside six months in lisbon is admitted gratis to these assemblies but the subscription for residents is seven moidores for each room these societies have since been united and a large room is built for that purpose during the winter there are four grand balls with suppers to which many of the portuguese nobility are invited  there a no newspapers or gazettes printed in the portuguese language these having been prohibited in      the english french and spanish are to be seen in the coffee houses of which two are extremely elegant especially that of casaco which is pannelled with looking glasses  it is very difficult to ascertain the number of inhabitants in lisbon the different foreign factories not being numbered with the natives the english factory alone is computed at  00 souls the dutch and german factories consist also of a very great number of persons  previous to the earthquake the attestations sent to rome in order to procure bulls assigned  00000 inhabitants to the metropolis the earthquake which happened on the first of november      is said by some to have destroyed   000 persons by others   000 by others  0000 indeed it is impossible to calculate this loss with exactness lisbon may certainly be classed at present among the first cities for size and populousness and possibly may be ranked as the fourth the other three being london paris and naples  the king had two palaces in lisbon and they were both destroyed yet none of the royal family perished they were going from lisbon to belem and at the time were in a part of the road where there was no house near had they remained a quarter of an hour longer in lisbon or arrived a quarter of an hour sooner in belem it is probable they would have perished as the royal palace at belem was likewise destroyed king queen princesses and all their attendants were obliged to encamp in the neighboring fields and the british envoy who was there at the time wrote over to the ministry that five days after the earthquake he went to belem to pay his respects to them but that the queen sent him word she could not receive him as she was in a tent and in no condition to be seen imagine what the misery of the people must have been when even the royal family suffered so much  nor must we forget to mention the universal conflagration that followed the earthquake this misfortune fell out at ten oclock in the forenoon that is when all the kitchen fires were lighted against dinner time and all the churches illuminated in honor of the day the fires in the kitchens and the lights in the churches rolled against the combustible matters that were in their way and the ruined town was presently in flames lisbon is furnished with water by the means of aqueducts but the aqueducts were broken by the concussion so that little or no water was to be had yet had it been ever so plentiful the town would not have escaped the conflagration because every one ran away to the fields and other open spaces and thus more loss was occasioned by the fire than by the earthquake as it consumed every thing the people had in their houses which might in a great measure have been dug out of the ruins if it had not been consumed by the fire what a spectacle for so many hundred thousand people to see all their houses in flames at once  the english factory has a buryingground in one of the skirts of the city planted with walks of cypresstrees under which are the graves where says twiss i had the mortification to see many marble monuments with long pompous flattering inscriptions erected to the memory of some of the merchants their wives and their children whilst the great author of tom jones is interred in this buryingground without even a stone to indicate that here lies henry fielding  the trade and navigation of this city are so very considerable that the customhouse which lies on the tagus is the chief source of the kings european revenues this is the grand magazine of all the goods which the portuguese bring from their foreign colonies the harbor is very large deep secure and convenient it has two entrances that on the north called the corredor lies between the sandbank the rock of cachopos and fort st julian the southern entrance which is much broader and more convenient is between cachopos and fort s lawrence  the tagus is navigable but a little way above lisbon occasioned by its running between inaccessible rocks and its current is broken by many rapid cataracts a company of dutchmen in the reign of charles ii offered to cut roads over the rocks and to make dykes and sluices which would facilitate the passage of boats from lisbon quite to madrid provided the revenue was given them which amounted from taxes levied on goods thus to be conveyed by water  several councils were in consequence held at madrid and lisbon the conclusion of their deliberations was if god had been willing to have this river navigable he did not want the assistance of man to render it so because he was able to produce that great effect by a single fiat this as he had not done it followed that he did not think proper to do it so that it would be contradicting his providence to endeavor to rectify what he appeared to have left imperfect for reasons best known to himself  thus vanished this useful project in consequence of the philosophical determination of these councils  a similar mode of reasoning seems to be adopted by the people of minorca who never prune a tree the vine excepted thinking it irreligious in some degree to presume to direct its growth and if any stranger should express his wonder that they forbear this useful practice and inform them of the advantages attending it in other countries their answer is  god knows best how a tree should grow  this city is walled round having    towers on the walls and    gates in the center of this capital on one of the mountains stands a citadel which commands the whole place and has caverns in it where four regiments of foot are constantly quartered close by the sea at the distance of about    miles from the city both the entrances to the harbor are defended by two forts the river here is not above two miles over though it widens by degrees toward lisbon where it is at least ten miles broad between lisbon and these forts stands another fort called fort belem or belleisle which commands the entrance into the city and where all the ships coming up the tagus must give an account of themselves the prospect at the entrance of the tagus from the sea cannot be exceeded the buildings on the shore near belem which is the royal residence appear many of them to be of noble construction they are all white on the outside with lattices and windowshutters painted green which have a fine effect from the river many of the houses have gardens and terraces ornamented with vases statues turrets and obelisks and with so many trees round them that the coup daeil is rendered one of the grandest and most picturesque imaginable  about    leagues to the northwest of the mouth of the harbor are the burlings as they are called in the charts they consist of abundance of little rocky islands a little distant from the shore three of them only showing themselves above water  here the portuguese maintain a kind of garrison if we may allow it that name it consists of malefactors who are banished hither for a term for diverse small offenses a policy which they may have copied from the egyptians as we may read in diodorus siculus that wise people to prevent the corruption of good manners by evil communication built a town on the red sea whither they transported a great number of their criminals having first set an indelible mark on them to prevent their returning and mixing with the sober part of the citizens  at this place called by fielding the castle of belleisle we were saluted with a gun which was a signal to pass no farther till we had complied with certain ceremonies which the laws of this country require to be observed by all ships which arrive in this port we were obliged then to cast anchor and expect the arrival of the officers of the customs without whose passport no ship must proceed farther than this place  here likewise we received a visit from one of those magistrates of health beforementioned he refused to come on board the ship till every person in her had been drawn up on deck and personally viewed by him this occasioned some delay on my part says fielding as it was not the work of a minute to lift me from the cabin to the deck the captain thought my particular case might have been excused from this ceremony and that it would be abundantly sufficient if the magistrate who was obliged afterward to visit the cabin surveyed me there but this did not satisfy the magistrates strict regard to his duty when he was told of my lameness he called out with a voice of authority  let him be brought up and his orders were presently complied with he was indeed a person of great dignity as well as of most exact fidelity in the discharge of his trust both which are the more admirable as his salary is less than l 0 english per annum  before a ship has been visited by one of these magistrates no person can lawfully go on board her nor can any one depart from her this i saw exemplified in a remarkable instance a young lad one of our passengers was here met by his father who on the first news of the captains arrival came from lisbon to belleisle in a boat being eager to embrace a son whom he had not seen for many years but when he came alongside our ship neither did the father dare ascend nor the son descend as the magistrate of health had not yet been on board  some of my readers will perhaps admire the great caution of this policy so nicely calculated for the preservation of this country from all pestilential distempers others will as probably regard it as too exact and formal to be constantly persisted in in seasons of the utmost safety as well as in times of danger i will not decide either way but will content myself with observing that i never yet saw or heard of a place where a traveller had so much trouble given him at his landing as here the only use of which as all such matters begin and end in form only is to put it into the power of low and mean fellows to be either rudely officious or grossly corrupt as they shall see occasion to prefer the gratification of their pride or their avarice  of this kind likewise is that power which is lodged with other officers here of taking away every grain of snuff and every leaf of tobacco brought from other countries though only for the temporary use of the person during his residence here this is executed with great insolence and as it is in the hands of the dregs of the people very scandalously for under pretense of searching for tobacco and snuff they are sure to steal whatever they can find insomuch that when they come on board our sailors addressed us in the covent garden language pray gentlemen and ladies take care of your swords and watches indeed i never saw any thing equal to the contempt and hatred which our honest tars every moment expressed for these portuguese officers  at belleisle lies buried catherine of arragon widow of prince arthur eldest son of our henry vii afterward married to and divorced from our henry viii close by the church where her remains are deposited is a large convent of geronymites one of the most beautiful piles of building in all portugal  having undergone the inspection of the magistrate of health i sent my man to bespeak a good dinner and then to bring a lisbon chaise with him to the seashore at his return after keeping me waiting full three hours on the deck he told me there was a new law lately made that no passenger should set his foot on shore without a special order from the providore and that he himself would have been sent to prison for disobeying it had he not been protected as the servant of the captain he informed me likewise that the captain had been very industrious to get this order but that it was then the providores hour of sleep a time when no man except the king himself durst disturb him  to avoid prolixity though in a part of my narrative which may be more agreeable to my reader than it was to me the providore having at last finished his nap dispatched this absurd matter of form and gave me leave to come or rather be carried on shore  what it was that first gave the hint of this strange law it is not easy to guess possibly in the infancy of their defection and before their government could be formed they were willing to guard against the bare possibility of surprise of the success of which bare possibility the trojan horse will for ever remain on record as a great and memorable example now the portuguese have no walls to secure them and a vessel of two or  00 tons will contain a much larger body of troops than could be concealed in that famous machine though virgil tells us somewhat hyperbolically that it was as big as a mountain  the portuguese derive the origin of this city from elisa a great grandson of noah who is said to have been its first founder and that ulysses was its restorer though this is not very probable yet it is certain the city was anciently called ulyssaea or ulyssipolis and hence was changed in time to olisipo the romans as appears from some ancient inscriptions gave it the name of felicitas julia but the goths called it olisipona which the moors altered to olisibona whence in process of time was formed lisbon  nothing can be more disgusting to a stranger than the filth of the streets in this metropolis of portugal in fact says costigan the streets are never cleaned although there is an established contract for scavengers this filth would be much more noisome than it actually is were not every thing that can be eat up by starving dogs quickly devoured by swarms of these animals who live abroad and belong to no one a fine northern breeze which springs up about noon refreshes the parched inhabitants of at least all the higher parts of the city and carries off the baneful effluvia thrown even sometimes during the day from the windows of the different houses yet after all it is impossible to walk the city without the olfactory nerves being continually saluted with the most disagreeable sensations accordingly no persons who can possibly avoid it ever walk the streets both on account of the violent heat and the great distance the city being so exceedingly spread in all directions so that it is a common observation of the natives that except persons of the lowest condition no person is to be met with on foot during some hours of the violent heat but dogs and englishmen  another singular circumstance very striking to a stranger rambling about this city is the great number of negroes many of these unhappy wretches are natives of africa others born either in portugal or in its ultramarine dominions no ships arrive from that quarter of the globe without some and when in portugal they are allowed to marry not only among themselves but also with those of a different color these crossmarriages says baretti have filled the country with different breeds of human monsters a black and a white produce a mulatto then a mulatto joins with a black or a white and two other creatures are engendered called mestices then the white mestices join with the black mestices or with two real blacks whites or mulattos and all branch out into so many and various kinds that it becomes very difficult to distinguish them by peculiar names though they are easily to be distinguished by their peculiar hues  to such a degree has the original race of the portuguese been depraved that to be a blanco that is a perfect white is become a title of honor so that when a portuguese says he is a blanco it is not to be understood that he is a white but that he is a man of honor a person of family and consequence  to all these mongrel mixtures may be added the jewish portugal abounds with jews who personate christians and often intermarry with the portuguese and negroes these strange combinations have filled lisbon with such a variety of uncouth faces as to make the traveller doubt if he is really in europe and in a few centuries not a drop of portuguese blood will be left in the country but the whole will be corrupted between jews and negroes  to obviate one of these evils both of which might easily be removed by a secular tribunal the inquisition is always on the watch to find out the jews who if discovered are certain to meet with no mercy from the holy fathers let a man but avow himself a jew and to be thrown into the flames will be his punishment this incessant diligence to detect the jews makes them redouble their arts to conceal themselves and it is from this circumstance that numbers of persons of both sexes and of all ages and situations in life when they walk about the city carry with them long rosaries and may be seen continually muttering paternosters and ave marias that if jews they may be thought christians or if christians that they may not be looked upon as jews  to judge from the capital the industry of this nation is not great almost all the linen woollen and silk goods to be met with in the different shops are of foreign importation although they have in their own country most of the raw materials their steel copper and brass work is likewise imported from abroad as are even their shoes except such as are made by foreigners french tailors and hairdressers swarm in lisbon as they do in london statuaries architects and engravers here never possessed any of the least celebrity as for painters they can boast of only one alonzo sanches coello a disciple of raphael and a favorite of philip ii who used to call him titian the second he is more known in italy than portugal  the disagreeable sensation to the organs of the ear in this city by the creaking of the cartwheels is inexpressible they are here made out of two boards nailed together and clumsily cut in a circular form yet this painful noise might be obviated if the carmen would grease the axletrees to this they object saying the devil would then do mischief to their oxen and that this noise frightens him away  among the charitable institutions worthy of being noticed are the misericordia and all saints hospitals the former has a magnificent church and is under the direction of the principal nobility the stewards are chosen annually the expense of serving that office to those who would acquire fame amounts to   or  000l sterling a year the funds of this hospital are applied to the relief of such persons as are reduced to indigence and ashamed to solicit alms they are likewise appropriated to the portioning of young women to the relief of prisoners under confinement for debt and to assist them in compounding with their creditors that they may obtain their freedom priests are also appointed by those who have the direction of this charity to attend and administer consolation to such criminals as are under sentence of death in short they succor and relieve all persons who not abandoned themselves to vice when laboring under sickness or penury  the hospital of all saints is one of the largest and best endowed in europe here they receive and administer relief to persons of all nations and religions the sick the lame the lunatic the foundling all find an asylum in this hospital and when dismissed have money given them to subsist upon till they are otherwise provided for  the country about lisbon is agreeably diversified with groves of orange and lemon trees intermixed with olives and vineyards the roads are bordered with aloes which make an uncommon appearance to a native of a colder climate when in flower the stem being then    or    feet high these aloes blow every sixth or seventh year what brydone says of those in sicily is likewise just in respect of these as the whole substance of the plant is carried into the stem and flowers the leaves begin to decay as soon as they have done blowing and numerous young plants are produced round the roots of the old ones which wither and die  most of the roads in the environs are paved with large stones near the city in the valley of alcantara is situated the celebrated aqueduct which joins two hills and supplies the city with water this aqueduct runs transversely over a valley a quarter of a mile in breadth the space between the two center pillars is so wide and lofty that a  0 gun ship might pass through with all her sails spread this building is an erection of the year      and fortunately received little or no damage from the earthquake in      the whole of this immense fabric is built of white marble  the palace at belem about five miles from lisbon where the court usually reside is a very mean wooden edifice says twiss and has nothing worthy of remark either on the outside or in the inside there is not so much as a single picture from any of the italian schools in the whole kingdom of portugal what few pictures there were formerly in lisbon were destroyed by the earthquake nor are there any statues in portugal except two groupes in the royal gardens of this palace exposed to the air very injudiciously  these groupes are of two figures each as large as life and of white marble one is the daughter giving suck to her father and the other is a woman fainting and reclining in the arms of another woman they are indeed perfectly beautiful and in good preservation  near the palace at belem is a pillar erected with an inscription importing that to be the spot where the late duke of aveiros palace stood he was executed for having shot at the king in      and the palace was erased  there are several magnificent monasteries in the environs of lisbon of which it may be proper to give some general account the first that we shall notice is the royal convent at mafoa this pile of buildings contains    windows in front and is nearly a square of     feet the church and the royal apartments take up one half of it and the convent the other the whole of the chief front is as noble as art can make it the gate in the middle has on each side an insulated column of a kind of granite little inferior to the egyptian each column is cut out of a single block and is about three fathoms in circumference but what is most striking is the ascent to the church this is by a grand flight of semicircular stairs which projects     feet into the square before the building each corner of the chief front supports a dome in the form of a pavillion these domes viewed at a proper distance have a fine effect and contrast surprizingly well with the cupola and the four belfries belonging to the church the roof of the apartments and the church exclusive of the pavillion the cupola and the belfries is laid out in a kind of terrace commanding an extensive prospect the belfries contain   0 bells of various sizes which by the means of clockwork ring a great number of curious chimes or carillons the profusion of gold silver jewels and precious marbles is incredible there are several altars in this church each as rich as money and workmanship can make them one altar alone is said to have cost from  0 to  0000l  there are two large courtyards in this convent surrounded says baretti by the finest porticos i ever saw even much superior to those at venice and which support several apartments destined for the officers of state when the court is there these apartments as well as those of their majestys form a long range of rooms communicating with that part of the building allotted to the friars this consists of three dormitories a refectory an infirmary a kitchen a library etc one of these dormitories may be about  00 common paces in length and wide enough for ten persons to walk abreast the cells on each side are in number about  00 not low and narrow as in other convents but spacious and lofty so that they might each be termed a chamber fit for a rman prelate to inhabit the friars are not so numerous as the cells there are of them only  00 besides   0 laybrothers the furniture of each cell consists of a narrow uncovered bed a table a few chairs and a shelf for books the layfriars have no shelves few of them being able to read the refectory is a noble sight the table that runs through it admits of   0 people on each side yet there is sufficient space for another at which the king sometimes dines with his grandees  as i entered the refectory adds baretti a little before dinner the cloth was laid and i could not help remarking that between every two friars there was a jug containing about two bottles of wine these jugs were all alike of white earthen ware with the kings arms engraved upon them close to each mug was likewise placed a trencher of brazil wood with half a dozen figs a couple of bunches of grapes and two lemons the rest of the dinner consisted of three good dishes gras or maigre according to the day to every friar a pound of bread is also allotted with liberty to call for more when the  00 padres are at dinner the   0 laybrothers wait behind them with the greatest respect it is the king who furnishes them with this food which makes them all look so florid and so jolly such faces says baretti i never saw in my life not even in the pictures of paul veronese who delighted in painting handsome friars the maintenance of this religious establishment is said to cost the king about   000l a year the smallest part of the establishment is the infirmary but it must be observed that those friars who are become old or invalids valids are sent to some other convents and young and healthy ones are substituted in their room  their library occupies a very large hall besides another chamber of considerable dimensions the hall contains about  0000 volumes and the chamber about  0000 amongst these latter are all the portuguese books that could possibly be collected there is scarce a family of any note in the kingdom who cannot boast of an historian hence it is said arises that noble elevation of mind which makes the portuguese look with the greatest disdain upon all other nations and despise every thing that is not portuguese in this chamber there are books of devotion and lives of saints out of number s anthony alone has above  00 volumes on these shelves each relating his exploits in a different manner no alexander no augustus no king of prussia was ever honored with so much biography as s anthony  according to the opinion of the friars the lesser library is much more valuable than the other in one respect they are right as duplicates of books in the larger library are to be purchased but those in the less being books written in the portuguese language are become very scarce since the earthquake however the loss will not be very severely felt there being few writers in that language of any celebrity the large library is a very good one besides a very capital collection of books in the ancient languages it contains some valuable manuscripts in hebrew and arabic and some of the friars are men of letters  here is a park of very considerable extent but far from being embellished by that verdure so conspicuous in our english ones it having very much the appearance of a parched and rocky desert thinly scattered with trees  the first stone of this building was laid in      and though above  000 workmen were employed for more than  0 years and a considerable number are still occupied upon it the building is not yet completed  the occasion of its erection was owing to a vow made by the archduchess who was married to john v on approaching the coast of portugal the mountains of mafra were the first land she saw and the first favor she solicited of her royal consort was that he would erect a convent on them to the virgin mary and s anthony to whose joint protection she considered herself indebted for having landed safe in portugal  about four leagues from lisbon is situated the convent of odivelas where it is said  00 beautiful nuns formed a seraglio for the late monarch each of them had one or more lovers and were the most attracting mistresses of the portuguese nobility at present few of them are living and those that remain are grown old and ugly so that this place is no longer that scene of debauchery it was formerly a french writer speaking of this convent says that the famous portuguese letters afterward translated into french came from this tender gallant and voluptuous monastery  i bought in this convent says twiss several workbags made of the fibers of aloeleaves they cost about a crown and when soiled are cleaned by being washed in lemonjuice and water laces gloves reins for horses etc are made of the same materials  near this monastery is another royal convent in which are   0 monks who are all noble and have each a servant which with the cooks and gardeners amount to above  00 persons so that it is not to be wondered at that it is as difficult to procure an egg or an onion for many miles round as it would be if one traveled by land from petersburg to pekin for this great gulf swallows up every thing the revenue of this convent amounts to about   000l a year in the library are baskervilles virgil and fouliss homer both which were presented to the society by the present lord rivers the kitchen is very large and the chimney stands in the center the funnel of which is    feet long    broad and is supported by eight iron pillars under this funnel are a great number of cauldrons of different kinds a small rivulet is made to run through the kitchen in which are seven cooks constantly employed the vaults under the convent are filled with various kinds of wines and in their stables are several hundred mules for these worthy fathers to ride upon this convent adds twiss is the most magnificent and richest i have seen and its inhabitants compose the most agreeable body of ecclesiastics that are any where to be met with  oporto the other city we proposed to treat of and its suburb villanova are each built on a hill with the douro between them a situation much resembling newcastleupontyne and its suburb gateshead there is no bridge over the douro because when the snow melts upon the mountains this river overflows its banks and lays the lower part of the city under water sometimes as much as    or    feet running at the amazing rate of    miles an hour and carrying all the vessels to sea many of which are lost on the sands or beat to pieces against the shores  this city was originally called portucale or porto de cale it is about three miles distant from the mouth of the river douro which here forms a good harbor though difficult of access from the rocks and sands forming a bar which can only be passed at high water there is a fine quay which runs along the banks of the river where the shipping lie so that the merchants may see the vessels load and unload from their windows  there is also an arsenal and dockyards for building and equipping ships of the line although the situation of this place is naturally strong and inaccessible by sea yet for its defense on the landside it has only some ruinous towers and a small fort with four bastions  to walk about this city says costigan is rather a violent exercise not one street in it being upon a level except that where most part of the english inhabit all the others consist of ascents and descents some of them so very steep as to make it difficult for any sort of wheelcarriage to get along for which reason litters carried between a couple of stout mules are a much safer conveyance the streets are all paved with broad stones as are those in florence  the boats on the river have an awning like the venetian gondolas and are rowed by men standing forward after the same manner as they row at venice and sometimes by one man with a single oar  the merchants assemble daily in the chief street to transact business and are protected from the sun by sail cloths hung across them from the opposite houses  this city which for opulence populousness beauty and commerce is the next in the kingdom to lisbon contains about  0000 inhabitants it has four suburbs and seven parish churches including the cathedral one casa da misericordia some hospitals and    convents besides four others without the walls the most magnificent building is a convent of the augustins in which there is a beautiful gallery of very great extent the church belonging to it is of a circular form and very richly ornamented the church of s francisco is full of wooden ornaments profusely carved and entirely gilt which has a very disgusting effect i observed says twiss many letters hanging by threads from the wall directed to the most glorious s francis as they were all open i took the liberty of reading some and found they were only complimentary cards and letters of thanks for cures which the writers thought they had received by means of that saints interest with the virgin mary etc  the chief article of commerce in this city is wine twentythousand pipes are annually exported the cost is about  0 or    pounds each pipe eightythousand are the usual annual produce so that threefourths are consumed in the country the merchants here have very spacious winevaults some of which are capable of holding   or  000 pipes the inhabitants of half the shops in the city are coopers who sell their casks at about a moidore each thirty english families reside here who are chiefly concerned in this commerce the factory maintains the clergyman who performs service on sundays at each house alternately they have also a burying ground in a field near the town a british consul likewise resides here it does not appear that the english merchants in this city any more than those at lisbon and cadiz associate much with the people of the country they are represented by costigan to be a worthy friendly and hospitable set of people as attentive to their countingrooms and business every day before dinner as they are to dressing cards and other amusements in the evening many of them have been  0 or  0 years resident in oporto yet know but few words of the language if they take a trip to any part of the adjacent country on a holiday it is in parties of pleasure with the ladies to some spot they have fixed upon where they send a good dinner before hand there they dance eat and drink heartily without any communication with the inhabitants who by their manners and appearance adds the above writer are no great objects of attraction to the generality of englishmen  the two cities of lisbon and oporto may be justly considered as the two eyes of portugal for here center the whole riches of the country and all their trade with foreign nations and their own possessions in the brasils upon which last especially depends their whole existence as a people and the chief support of the throne a sensible portuguese writer whose manuscript performances are in the hands of his friends but which he dares not offer for publication compares not unaptly their whole kingdom to one of that sort of spiders which has a large body containing all the substance the capital with very long thin feeble legs reaching to a great distance but which are of no sort of use to it and which it is hardly able to move  were any of us disposed to estimate our felicity according to the goodness or badness of our living says costigan in speaking of this city we have as much reason to congratulate ourselves on our arrival here as we have hitherto had to deem ourselves unfortunate in our journey through the country christmas pies fat turkeys fine surloins jellies and creams of all kinds and every other delicacy are to be met with in abundance the foreign merchants especially the english who are by far the most numerous not only live in affluence themselves and much better than the same persons would do in london but the natives follow their example and live much in the same manner they mix and communicate more with the foreigners here than their countrymen do with those established at lisbon where as being the court it was more natural to expect a disposition to urbanity and mutual intercourse  chap iii people dress character customs manners etc emanuel de farca a portuguese writer in describing the character of his countrymen says the nobility think themselves gods and require a sort of adoration the gentry aspire to equal them and the common people disdain to be thought inferior to either in their persons the portuguese bear great resemblance to the spaniards except that the latter are more robust of a larger size and make better soldiers than those of portugal as to the ladies their complexions are in general of an olive cast their features are delicate and their visage thin their hair is black and shining and their eyes of uncommon luster nor are they deficient in vivacity they have likewise the repute of being generous charitable and modest  in another place describing their persons  baretti says they are in general much fairer than one would expect in so hot a latitude from which it may be seen very clearly they do not expose themselves much to the sun almost all of them have open and ingenuous countenances a good contrast to their men whose skins are rather swarthy and whose looks are rather sullen and grave even when they attempt to smile which they do very frequently the salutation of men to ladies consists in a short and quick genuflexion but this compliment the ladies scarcely return with a nod especially to their inferiors the gentlemen embrace each other with great respect and kiss each others left shoulder  the portuguese remarks baretti are of a disposition much more amorous than the english love is the predominant passion on the tagus as liberty is on the thames but this generally happens to people of warm climates in the northern regions much clothing as well as firing is necessary to make life pass comfortably and where clothing and firing are wanting a considerable portion of time must be employed in procuring them this is the reason that in england there are multitudes of people who have never been in love even once in their lives in portugal they are slaves to the god of love almost from the hour of their birth to that of their death and camoens very justly said fair venus cherishes the portuguese  in their devotion the difference between them and the english is striking we sit or stand with a composed look sing our psalms and anthems with an even tone and scarce any one not of the sect of methodists who may be called the lusitanic part of of the british nation betrays the least enthusiasm whatever the portuguese on the contrary are devout to a degree of phrenzy they are almost all the time upon their knees they raise their eyes wistfully toward heaven sing loud utter most fervent ejaculations and repeatedly beat their breasts with their hands the respect they pay their friars is astonishing men women and children will eagerly get up run to them and humbly kiss their hands their sleeves the hem of their garments or the beads that hang from their waists when they die they must be buried in a habit bought of some friar whese sanctity was in great repute as a proof of this baretti mentions an impudent portuguese friar he met with at venice who called all the italians heretics because they would give him nothing for his old threadbare cloak which in portugal he could have sold for  0 or  0 crowns  but this devotion of the portuguese does not in the least interfere with their love of the other sex or their love of dancing of which they are passionately fond their dances are not of the cold insipid frenchified kind but such as are calculated to fill the mind with desire and the heart with joy  thus live the portuguese in an uninterrupted round of devotion and pleasure they are neither gluttons nor drunkards although their country wants neither food nor drink their beef and veal are not so good as in england but their pork mutton and lamb are excellent and so are their chickens fowls ducks turkies and game as for fish the lisbon market is perhaps the most plentifully and most variously supplied of any in europe and all their fruit and gardenstuff is superlatively good how abundant must be their fruit may easily be conceived when twiss assures us that from a single orangetree in a garden belonging to one of the english merchants near oporto no less than   000 oranges had been gathered in one season  the poorer sort of people seldom are able to procure flesh but the better kind keep good tables and have french cooks to keep a table however says baretti must require a considerable income in lisbon if it costs proportionably in a family to what it does in an inn the table he adds at his auherge which was far from being sumptuous cost him upwards of a guinea each day  of the manners of living of people of fashion he pretends to know but little the inferior classes seem to like a good house if they can get one as to household furniture they have no very refined ideas a hard mattrass in a corner or a mat or their own clothes answer the purpose of the best down beds this makes them generally look dirty almost any thing will supply the place of victuals and water is excellent for quenching thirst especially such good water as they have in lisbon in general they are healthy full of spirits and live long if we may judge of the great number of old people we see in their metropolis costigan in his remarks on the lower class of people among the portuguese says that the benefits of foreign trade and of the fine and extensive countries possessed by portugal in africa the east and south america have never yet reached the portuguese peasant any farther than by enabling the inhabitants of the two capitals oporto and lisbon to pay some little advance on the provisions he brings to market the only foreign luxury he is yet acquanted with is tobacco and when his feeble pulse can reach it he purchases a dried newfoundland codfish a regale however he can seldom aspire to a piece of bread made of indian corn and a salted pilchard or a head of garlic to give that bread a flavor compose his standing dish and if he can get a bit of the hog the ox or the calf he himself fattens to feast his wretched family at christmas or easter he has reached the pinnacle of happiness in this world and indeed whatever he were to possess beyond this habitual penury would quickly be taken from him or rather he would willingly part with it to some of the numerous ghostly comforters with which his country swarms in order to attain happiness in another state of existence under their guidance and direction this he is made to believe is only to be procured by faithfully paying his tithes by charitable donations to such a convent or to the shrine and officiating priests of any altar that happens more particularly to be the object of his adoration if any misfortune has befallen him he fancies he has been deficient in something essential his zeal and donations are therefore redoubled should he have been successful the same effects are produced through effusions of gratitude if he has money to procure admission into a convent for his son or his daughter this raises the credit of his family for ever and nothing is wanting to give him a kind of apotheosis in all the convents and country round but to bequeath at his death what little money he can muster to be divided among the priests that they may procure a speedy passage for his soul through the ordeal fire of purgatory to the enjoyment of those finely painted scenes which like a distant gaudy picture have been long held out to his fond imagination  such according to the above writer is the state of the portuguese peasantry we suspect however the picture to be too highly colored at least that part which regards the artifices of the priests and that the real cause of their poverty and wretchedness is the want of internal commerce and manufactures whether catholics or protestants of whatever sort or denomination the lower order of priests in every country find some specious pretexts for picking the pockets of that class of people he is describing but the quantum they obtain from each individual is seldom of much moment when compared with their relative income  the dress of the men among the common people is a large cloak and slouched hat under the cloak they commonly wear a dagger though that treacherous portuguese peasants weapon is prohibited the blades of some of these will strike through a crown piece the women wear no caps but tie a kind of network silk purse over their hair with a long tassel behind and a ribbon tied in a bowknot over their forehead this headdress they call redecilla and it is worn indiscriminately by both sexes the gentry dress entirely in the french fashion  swords are only worn by welldressed people and all ornaments of gold or silver lace or embroidery are prohibited to be worn on the clothes of the portuguese of both sexes their silk clothes are sometimes elegantly embroidered with silk of a different color and many jewels are displayed on gala days topazes here are very plentiful and extremely well set but their silversmiths workmanship is very clumsy  the ladies wear very large and heavy pendants in their ears the sleeves of their gowns are wide enough to admit their waist which however seldom exceeds a span in diameter they wear enormous hoops and two or three gowns one over the other some of which are very richly embroidered but the uppermost is of a coarse black stuff and of such length that when not taken up it trails a very considerable length on the ground their shoes are of black spanish leather without heels so that they appear to glide along rather than walk these they wear only within doors but when they go out they put on a kind of pattens or silk sandals fastened with gold clasps which raise their feet several inches from the ground and make their gait appear awkward their stays which have very little bone in them are high before but so low behind that their olive colored skins would be exposed to view were their shoulders not well bedaubed with paint their hands and feet are small and well proportioned people of fashion wear very fine linen but those of the lower class disdaining to wear coarse wear none at all instead of a girdle the ladies tie a string of relics or the girdle of some religious order round their waists the ends of which reach to the ground with several knots in them and to each knot is fastened a diamond or some other precious stone in their hair they wear a variety of precious stones in the form of butterflies and other insects it is likewise sometimes adorned with feathers and ribbons of different colors but no kind of lace or muslin headdress is worn in portugal except by women very far advanced in years who wear a fine caul  in this country observes baretti as in france and italy they have the absurd custom of dressing up their children too much it is ridiculous to see a little girl decked out with a toupee and a large hoop or a child in full dress with a bagwig and sword by his side in england the sons and daughters of our nobility are not made to look like dwarfish men and women and this may be the reason that england abounds less with fops and coquets than either france or italy  with respect to the houses of people of fashion they have generally a long suite of rooms on each floor running one into another the floors and ceilings of which are of white plaster that looks to the eye like polished marble their furniture and apartments are changed according to the season of the year on the lower rooms of their summer apartments they throw several pails of water every morning which dries up in the course of half an hour and leaves a refreshing coolness for the rest of the day on these floors are spread fine mats and the walls covered with the same chair high above these are placed pictures and lookingglasses and round the ladies apartments are placed on the mats cushions of silk or velvet on which they sit cross legged in the upper apartments their hangings cabinets paintings lookingglasses and plate are immensely rich and the floors are generally covered with turkey carpets in winter their beds and hangings are velvet trimmed with gold or silver lace but in summer they have no curtains or only such as are made of colored gauze to keep out the gnats  the expenses of the interior economy of a portuguese noblemans family are certainly as moderate as they are excessive in every thing which regards exterior parade and ostentation such as numbers of liveryservants carriages mules and led horses in short every thing that can give a stranger an exaggerated opinion of the power wealth and authority of the master the numerous servants are supported by ratios of boiled meat and rice cut and divided into shares on meat days and of dry codfish and rice on fishdays and others of abstinence which return frequently exclusive of lent wine is seldom wanted but when asked for is brought in small quantities from the adjoining tavern but they drink abundance of fine cold water and at night the smallest bit of cold meat or a pilchard with plenty of excellent lettuce or other sallad tempered with oil and vinegar which make almost the universal sauce for every thing and good bread serve for supper in the morning the chief persons of the family generally make their breakfast of chocolate and that after hearing mass in the family chapel the great regale and luxury at all hours is the variety of sweetmeats they keep in store these serve them as provocations to drink deep draughts of water which blows them up surprisingly insomuch that there are many more fat people to be found in lisbon than in any other city  the principal luxury of a portuguese entertainment consists in the desert each of the company takes one or more spoonfuls of liquid sweetmeat and the more it is charged with sugar the more relishing it is esteemed a servant stands behind each chair with a large tumbler filled with very cold water which they drink immediately after the sweetmeat the epicurians and refiners in the pleasure of eating drink the water slowly in order to protract the delightful sensation that cold water raises in the palate when mixed with the sweetmeat it has just before been so strongly impressed with and which the portuguese assert very far exceeds the relish of the finest wine that can be drank it is true the waterdrinkers in spain as well as those in portugal who especially among the higher ranks are by far the majority of both nations distinguish with wonderful nicety every gradation of difference between the respective waters they taste and which would be totally imperceptible to those like the english or germans and other northern nations who have their sense of tasting dull and blunted by the frequent use of wine and other intoxicating liquors  the dessert is not as in england and in france set upon the same table with the rest of the dinner but upon a much smaller and in another apartment where the company withdraw to finish their repast it consists of sweatmeats and fruits after having partaken of the former they eat of the different fruits and drink a glass of malmsey maidera set upon the table in small half pint bottles with very small glasses the edges of which are generally gilt this wine like the sweetmeats is sweet and luxurious in the extreme  costigan in his sketches of society and manners in portugal describing an entertainment at the governor of elvas one of the principal cities in the province of alentego says we arrived at the hour of dinner one oclock which was then serving up the governors lady was the only woman at table and had more the appearance of his granddaughter than his wife she was wrapped up in her long baize cloak but her hair was done up prettily with flowers and topaz combs and a few diamond sprigs without any cap the governor was also in his cloak he took his place at the ladys right hand and the rest of the company which was numerous seated themselves according to their ranks the carving knight a post of honor still existing at court and in some families in portugal at the lower end of the table served the company round who were stiff and ceremonious neither was the aid of the chearing glass called in to exhilarate the guests but it seemed as if the water of which they took great draughts produced the same effect one of the principal guests in particular swilled down a threepint tumbler full of the crystal liquor at a draught at last the governor called for a wineglass into which was poured a thimblefull of that liquor one of the guests however a priest who seemed to be a wag says costigan called for wine repeatedly on which the lady began to rally him and told him he drank like a mauregato or an englishman here the governor calling for another glass of wine drank to the king of englands health putting the glass to his lips but did not taste the liquor either time the maurigatos are a fraternity of carriers of goods through many of the interior provinces of spain they are the harrieros yangueses of don quixotte and remarkable for their fidelity with regard to any trust committed to their care and for never admitting persons of equivocal character into their society as soon as the dinner was over a folding door opened that was behind the lady and the company passed into the next apartment where the dessert consisting of sweetmeats and fruits was set out on a much smaller table the company took their seats and were not crowded for above half of them had disappeared  if it should be asked why so great a part of the company who were officers retired immediately after dinner and did not come in to the dessert to answer that question it must be observed that there are numbers of books in portugal containing regulations for the disciplining clothing and economy of the troops but there is one above all others written many years ago entitled the perfect portuguese captain which book is still held in high esteem by the nobility and principal persons of the army as well as by the different orders of monks and friars it contains indeed little or nothing concerning the military duty of an officer but on the other hand it is quite the mirror of politeness and decorum it teaches the officer how many plaits he is to have in his shirt and how many curls in his wig the exact breadth of the lace on his coat how he is to bow and kneel when he comes into a room as they did to the lady of the governor it explains to the officer after the most diffuse and edifying manner all his duty as a catholic christian the nature of all the sacraments and how he is to receive them compares his kneeling at the altar to eat the deity to the honor of sitting down at table to dine with his general and it is particularly careful in directing the subaltern and captain how they are to behave in the solemn act tells them they are to keep their eyes modestly fixed on the plate or dish immediately before them that they are to tuck one end of the napkin under their chin and to place the other under the plate they eat off that they are to hold the spoon or knife in the right hand and the fork in the left with many other directions of equal importance as soon as dinner is over and the dessert served and before the general shall eat his sweetmeat every subaltern who shall happen to be at table must rise up and retire and this was the true reason why so many officers did not come into the dessert  this humiliating distinction toward subalterns has its rise from their commission never being signed by the king till the reform under count de lip in      and from their having been taken as they still continue to be for the most part from the menial servants of the nobility  to give some further insight into the characters and manners of people of fashion in portugal we shall relate a subsequent visit to the episcopal palace at elva says costigan where we were ushered into a large saloon tolerably well furnished and hung with crimson damask in which were some part of the company not already assembled this bishop boasted that he sprung from a noble family of english extraction but as to his personal character he was one of the most intriguing mischievous ecclesiastics any where to be met with and though his delicacy pretended to be scandalized at a person of the fair sex coming to visit him from lisbon yet he kept a couple of mistresses in the house with him under the denomination of nieces to whom we were then going to be introduced after some time the bishop made his appearance preceded by three ecclesiastics and his two nieces the company paid their respects and we were presented and received with great cordiality salvers of dry sweetmeats and glasses of water were then offered to the company after which some bad tea and coffee were handed about these being removed the cardtables were placed it fell to the lot of my friend who accompanied me an english nobleman to be partner with one of the nieces against the governor who had just then come in and the bishop during the course of play he felt some gentle squeezes on his toe to which at last he thought it time to correspond but would not venture to make the smallest motion till he could assure himself they proceeded from the lady and not perhaps accidentally from one of the two gentlemen on his right or left by casting his eyes unperceived under the table when the second rubber was about to begin he saw the ladys feet very well stretched out toward his own and had no more doubt of the part he was to act and the play then went on both under the table and over it my opponents says costigan were an officer and a judge dressed in his gown with a large cross at his breast much of our time was spent in their abusing each others play and during their altercation i observed they gave each other the lie direct repeatedly without the least appearance of offense on either side or any emotion of surprise among the spectators who were numerous upon mentioning to an old french general in their service the dumb intrigue carried on by my friend under the table at the bishops and asking if all the women of quality in the country were of such facility of address in matters of gallantry he laughed at the recital but told us that gallantry in portugal required great skill patience and address it was dangerous but by no means on the part of the ladies who of themselves were the best and kindest creatures imaginable but on account of the jealous eyes of male and female arguses for the mothers well know this to be the best security they could have for their daughters virtue on such occasions when the merciless sword was once unsheathed it seldom returned to the scabbard without doing mischief intrigue here he observed was as different from the same thing in paris or london as the two greatest opposites in nature and must be as differently managed  the family of a portuguese like that of a spanish nobleman always contains a swarm of useless clients and dependants when a person is once attached to a portuguese family it is considered as a kind of obligation to feed and support them from father to son or by his interest to provide them suitable establishments in the world and to marry off their daughters to the best advantage this number of male and female attendants collected under one roof in the great families occasions the whole to be one continued scene of private gallantry and intrigue the general rendezvous is every morning in the chapel where there are daily four or five masses celebrated by the family chaplains the language and intercourse of the lovers is unintelligible to all but the parties immediately concerned it is a toss of the head an eye cast up or thrown down to the right or left the fixing of a bouquet or the pinning of a flower or a ribband of such a color to such a part of the head or breast nay the very throw of the long cloak over the shoulders and the particular manner of doing so will convey the hieroglyphic of their wishes their intentions and assignations indeed it could hardly be otherwise where a number of idle and healthy young men and women are assembled under the same roof without any other moral or religious principle of restraint but the fear of being discovered and stimulated the more by the difficulties opposed to the gratification of their desires they will quickly counterfeit the appearance of every virtue to accomplish their ends  the following anecdote from costigan related by a french officer in the service of portugal major general de valere may serve as a confirmation of the underhand intrigues in the families of the portuguese nobility this officer although a favorite with marshal de saxe had been obliged by a variety of adventures in the early part of his life to offer his services to inspect the education of the son and heir of a portuguese nobleman of high rank with a view to make his way either in the army or to some civil employment but i soon found said the general that my only channel was by marrying one of the favorite maids of her excellency the mother of my pupil and that then i should be quickly provided for as for teaching the son any thing that was entirely out of the question his mother would never permit him to apply and his whole time in the morning was spent in conversing or playing at cards with the lacquies in the stables and in the afternoon he dressed in his uniform rode about the city went to the bullfeasts or did whatever he liked best i was perfectly idle and wished by almost any means for a commission in the army i had scraped a particular acquaintance with one of the gravest of the ladys attendants called the dya or subgoverness a very handsome woman and still in her prime she smattered a little french and under pretense of improving it i was frequently admitted to her conversation we soon came into the practice of the family and commenced a piece of gallantry which was carried as far as either she or i could desire she told me after we were become very intimate that she had a very great regard and friendship for me and that if i would agree to marry her daughter a very fine young girl and also an attendant in the family she would undertake to get me a captains commission i had already seen her daughter and except the circumstance of her being so had no objection and this i proposed to her when she next talked on the subject she answered me by saying she did not apprehend i was inclined to be so squeamish that i was one who was disposed to drown myself in very little water and that surely if she had no objection i ought to have none to become as intimate with her daughter as i had been with herself that there was no necessity for her daughters knowing any thing of our connection which might be carried on in the same manner after marriage as before without causing the smallest suspicion i temporized with this woman and begged time to advise with my relations in this she acquiesced provided i continued to be her gallant and during this time the effects of another piece of gallantry between her daughter and my friend the secretary became too visible to be any longer concealed which got me out of the scrape such another proposal being afterward made me by the mother of my young pupil in favor of another young person of her attendants i married her and got myself out of this base domestic sort of life  another singular custom in the great families of portugal is the putting servants almost on a level with the heads of the family the portuguese nobility and gentry are shocked at the improper and severe distance at which the english keep their servants treating them more like slaves than humble friends and attendants whereas they think that by gentle and familiar treatment they bid fairer for conciliating their affections and ensuring their fidelity a glaring instance of this sort says costigan i was eyewitness to at a grand entertainment given by a portuguese nobleman after tea coffee and sweetmeats had been served in abundance to a very large company a considerable part of it stood up to dance countrydances while others retired to other apartments where cardtables were placed and at a large one the eldest son of the family held a farobank which soon drew to it people enough willing to try their fortunes among whom i was one we continued playing for some time when looking round to my surprise i saw three or four of the domestics who had served us the tea and coffee seated familiarly among us punting at the bank and conversing with the banker and gentlemen upon the most equal footing and treated by them with the utmost civility and complaisance calling them by their christian names always preceded by senhor or mr in english  the portuguese nobility is divided into three classes when the ecuyer on horseback rides before the carriage the lisbon etiquette denotes it to belong to the firk rank the ecuyer riding on one side marks the second rank and when he rides behind he belongs to the third class of nobility it is also customary for gentlemen to sit uncovered in their carriages but a servant returning in one is obliged to sit covered by which means the persons sitting in other carriages which meet or pass it are betrayed into no improper salutations  a drunkard is held in contempt and detestation in portugal and the very appellation of drunkard seriously applied is reckoned equal to the bitterest term of reproach that can be bestowed in the english language on the contrary nothing is more common among friends and acquaintances in conversation than to give and receive the lie reciprocally in serious as well as jocular discourse without any offense being taken such are the opposite customs of different nations even in our limited continent of europe to this we shall subjoin an anecdote somewhat to the purpose which happened during the war in      major luttrell of general burgoynes light dragoons which were then serving in portugal seeing some fine spanish horses in the troop of an officer in the portuguese service who was then raising a regiment took a fancy to one of them and was desirous of purchasing it they accordingly made a bargain before witnesses and it was agreed he should have the horse the same evening for  0 moidores before evening came the captain changed his mind and sent the major word he could not let him have the horse unless he advanced considerably beyond the price major luttrell provoked at such a breach of promise went with his interpreter to the captain telling him beforehand that though he could not speak the language of the country yet he understood it well enough to know if he interpreted faithfully what he should tell him in english and swearing if he did not that he would instantly run him through the body when they came to the captain major luttrell asked him if he had not agreed in the forenoon to sell him such a horse at such a price to which the other readily answered in the affirmative he then asked him why he now receded from his bargain the captain answered he receded from it because the horse was too cheap and that he would not part with him unless he gave him  0 instead of  0 moidores major luttrell now ordered his interpreter to tell the captain that by his infamous behavior he had shown himself to be a liar a rascal and a scoundrel the captain at this shrugged his shoulders and said he was sorry the gentleman should take offense where none was intended but that he would part with his horse on no other terms on finding this the major desired the interpreter to acquaint the captain that in france or england if one officer bestowed on another such epithets as he had done on him the officer so grossly insulted must and certainly would directly call the other out and fight him  the captain still preserving his sang froid replied to the interpreter very deliberately that what the gentleman said might be very true for any thing he knew to the contrary but that he saw no good reason for preferring the practice of foreigners in this instance to that of his own country if he considered himself so affronted he should never be such a fool or a madman as by calling out his antagonist to offer him an equal chance of taking his life while he knew of a safer and more certain method of obtaining satisfaction adequate to the affront received in other words by stabbing him unawares or by hiring assassins to do so such is the point of honor in this country  beggars in portugal are very numerous it is impossible says baretti to conceive how i was teized by them there are always some come about you with a simpering look they hope you have had a good journey wish you may live  000 years and then ask for something to buy themselves alfileres that is pins if their first demand is complied with they have a second ready please vossa senhoria to give me something for a little babe i have at home well here is something for the little babe but pray good sir give me something for my dear mother for my younger sister for my cousin for my niece there is no end of their languid coquetry especially if the wenches be somewhat young and sprightly at peagones one of them came in whilst i was at dinner and first asked as usual for some pinmoney then for a loaf of bread then for a bit of the pastry then for a wing of a fowl then for a slice of cheese and then for a bunch of grapes having complied with each demand she sat down by me on the floor and ate heartily then returned to the attack and smiled prettily again and begged for some more money i verily believe had i given her one of my eyes she would have asked for the other this we give as a specimen of female bashfulness  as for the lower class of men such as innkeepers ostlers and muledrivers they generally address themselves uncovered to any stranger but always with a familiar smile upon their faces nor do they in the least appear timid or bashful  in lisbon says the above writer i once sent for a barber the fellow came with a simper on his cheeks sir i give you joy of your safe arrival in lisbon said he whilst placing the napkin under my chin and then asked leave to take a pinch of snuff out of my box in shaving me i was told many things by him of which he supposed me ignorant as that in portugal the weather was very hot that there were figs and grapes in abundance and likewise plenty of fish the sea being so very near his razors he said came from barcelona as in portugal they made none that were good when he had finished shaving one side of my face he stopped to ask what opinion i had of his countrymen and upon my answering that as yet i knew very little about them he seized that opportunity to inform me that os portuguezes sam mulito malerozos the portuguese are very spiteful and flourishing his barcelona weapon added with a lofty tone that the spaniards trembled at the name of a portuguese that one portuguese was sufficient to put to flight half a dozen spaniards nor was i fully shaved before he had conquered both the castilles of such rhodomontades portugal has even a larger number than of idlers  neighboring nations have in general a strong antipathy to each other but that of the portuguese to the spaniards is carried to such a pitch as borders upon madness the reason is plain the chance that the portuguese have to conquer spain is next to impossible and people will always hate those whom they must sometimes fight against without any hopes of getting the better of them on the contrary were the spaniards not prevented by the other european powers they would soon overrun portugal if so inclined it is perhaps from this notion that they have a proverb which says  the portuguese are few and foolish  the amusements of the common people are full of low buffoonery on entering a town which lay in my route through the kingdom says baretti i saw several hundred masks a group of them surrounded my chaise hallooing shouting and playing antics they said many things quite unintelligible to me in a squeaking voice which i suppose were intended to be full of wit the noise drew the women to their windows and i was pleased to see them laugh no less than the masks of the masks some were dressed like bears others like monkies one wore horns on his head and another had a tail hanging behind him one had tied his cloak round his waist petticoatwise and another had stockings of different colors some wore the golilla after the spanish manner and others large breeches after the swiss mode some shook the castanets others played on the guitar several stooped down in a row that others might jump over them and several ran round the square throwing their hands and legs about like madmen two of them came under the window of the inn and raised up their long sticks on which they had fastened wooden parrots ill shaped and ill painted then laughing most immoderately cried out montu montu many showed their humor by pulling off their hats to me and bowing to the ground with a mock respect  this buffoonery or low wit is extended to their poetry they are most unmerciful poettasters and make verses on every occasion the most trifling as well as the most important and all in the same bad style all equally bombastic extravagant and gigantic but on occasion of a marriage or the anniversary of a birthday the complimentary verses are held indispensable above all the glozers are what may be deemed the most ludicrous and extraordinary they very much resemble the improvisatori in italy and are held in the greatest esteem  when the company which are generally numerous on such occasions are assembled the wit who intends to exhibit if in conversation with any lady especially with one he affects to admire lays hold of any short sentence she happens to let fall in discourse and repeating it calls out la vay which is to advertise the company he is going to gloze that sentence which may be considered as his text and is distinguished by the name of mote that is he must make four eight and more verses ex tempore having reference to that sentence and containing most frequently extravagant compliments to the lady or sometimes to the bride or the company present the verses must be so disposed as to make good sense nor only with the mote or sentence fixed upon but if well executed the whole turn of the wit and emphasis of the verses must fall upon that sentence which must infallibly make the last line of the verses and all this suddenly and off hand they often ask the ladies to give them a mote or text which they must gloze immediately and where this is well performed the whole company clap hands and reecho from all parts bravo viva viva bello he who is dexterous at glozing in this manner is esteemed a firstrate genius and considered as having reached the summit of parnassus even their great camoens did not disdain amusing himself in this way and among others he made a gloze to every letter of the alphabet but when a lady glozes as some do very prettily she is praised and commended to the skies  it is usual for the portuguese nobility to give entertainments of this kind at their villas in the neighborhood of the capital a description of the splendor with which they are accompanied may not be unentertaining as their magnificence exceeds any thing to be seen in this country the one we are going to relate was given by the marquis de pancorva on the marriage of his daughter such quantities of ancient plate chairs tables utensils and such numbers of servants borrowed and collected from all his friends and acquaintances at such an exorbitant expense for one moment says costigan from whom the account is taken are only to be exemplified in the family of a portuguese nobleman the card of invitation we received on the occasion was to dine with him at his country house on the other side of the tagus and requested us to be at the waterside at    oclock next forenoon where there would be a barge in waiting to receive us and though we were punctual we found every thing there ready and the family embarked and a dozen other barges full of nobility with streamers and colors flying scarlet or crimson awnings surrounded with gold fringes and silk curtains the rowers of each barge were dressed in different uniforms one barge was rowed by  0 oars and three men to each rising up and sitting down at every stroke the whole setting off in cadence on a signal given each having a band of music on board a scene which reminded us of cleopatra going to meet anthony we had three leagues to go and our rowers stout men from the province exerted all their strength but the tide being far from favorable it was two oclock before we arrived at the scene of action a very large villa stood upon the beach surrounded by dwarffirs and sandhills dinner was already served in the second saloon into which we were ushered the table consisted of  0 covers with a couple of servants behind each chair the ladies were much fewer in number than the gentlemen the entertainment consisted of three regular services and the whole in old heavy massive plate many of the servants were in uniform others perfectly well dressed with fine lace ruffles and the collar and cross of the order of christ hanging on their breasts during dinner several pieces of perezs music were played and there were some charming arias by the best voices from the patriarchal church the same music continued at the dessert in the adjoining saloon to which we removed one half of the servants attending us thither whilst the other and graver part sat down to dinner at the table we left  the windows of the apartment where the dessert was served were numerous spacious and open to the bottom so that the floor was on a level with the ground without on which there now appeared a company of masks dressed as shepherds and shepherdesses with flowers and garlands and dancing in a variety of figures to the music which accompanied them when they ceased two men and as many women danced the spanish fandango in the midst of which and to the time of the music one of the men contrived to give a wheel into the saloon and placed a crown of myrtles beautifully interwoven with flowers and two billingdoves suspended over it on the head of the bride while one of the women did the same on the bridegroom this feat which in reality is a very nimble performance drew a hundred vivas from the company the poets became more and more vociferous with their motes and their glozas and the whole company seemed dissolved in joy and satisfaction at last about sunset coffee appeared and in an hour after the whole company were embarked in their barges for lisbon  the drollery and facetiousness of the watermen who were in dire wrath with their saint for not giving them a wind was now a new subject for mirth the barges had separated to the right and left in crossing the spacious basin to lisbon the better to enjoy the effects of the music our barge had taken the right of all and the tide coming full in as we approached the city where the current is extremely rapid we were carried a considerable way above it our stout algarve rowers pulling strong against the tide to very little purpose  i wish s anthony would send us a breeze from those hills to the north said one of the rowers as he often does would to god our lady obliged him to do so replied several others let us pray a responsio to him the responsio is a sort of prayer in bad latin which the priests teach the people to address to s anthony as the particular saint of lisbon to recover any thing they have lost or to obtain a happy journey or a fair wind etc when they had finished this prayer they all cried out with one voice blow blow s anthony  hand my gossip from the prow said a facetious fellow near me and i will talk to him this man named ivo was the established wit and oracle of the whole crew upon this they handed him a board about two feet long and five or six inches broad at the lower end was fixed a small box for receiving alms and about it was painted the figure of the saint with the child jesus in his arms ivo sat the saint down before them the rowers tugged away and we offered them wine which they refused but drank plenty of water which they had brought with them in their kegs ivo then addressed himself to s anthony you know gossip said he for s anthony was godfather to one of his children i am well acquainted with your tricks and have had but too much reason on many occasions to call you mulish and obstinate but i desire and expect you will not expose us now especially before these englishmen by your wrongheadedness for only consider what the watermen of london will think of you if these gentlemen should tell them that when we asked you only for a small puff of wind to carry us to your own city you had the shabbiness and ill nature to refuse it to us after some ribaldry with the other rowers ivo took up the board and shaking it found the alms box empty oh oh now i understand him exclaimed ivo now i know the reason we cannot get a wind my gossip will do nothing not even for our lady herself without an alms do pass him about among the noble company of fidalgos and let every one give him something as soon as he hears the money chinking in his box we shall have a wind directly when the alms were collected ivo set the saint down again before him by and by as i was become familiar to ivo i asked him where was the wind he had been so long promising us he assured me it would come for that although his gossip was sometimes slow he never failed him soon afterward some of the rowers said s anthony was a blockhead and a coxcomb and did not care a straw for what ivo said to him do you hear gossip said ivo what my comrades are saying of you though they speak truth and you richly deserve it all no wind appearing ivo began to call s anthony all the names he could think of told him if a ducking was all he wanted he should soon have his belly full of salt water he called him a fool a drunkard a thief a cuckold a cabrao pimp of his own wife and told him he would break his horns for him if he did not mind his business better  our men pulled away for an hour longer without the least sign of any wind at last ivo starting up in a violent passion drew his sharp pointed knife and presenting it to the face of the painting of s anthony said to him you son of a w  if it was not for the respect i have for that bastard son in your arms i would fill that ugly face of yours with stabs of my knife  soon after this we came nearly opposite to a sort of a valley at the upper end of the city from whence we had a breeze oh you will consent then after all will you you old cuckold after we have almost broken the bones of our arms with rowing now you come with your snivelling wind when we do not want your assistance but remember friend i tell you before all this noble company if you are not more tractable in future i will strike my name out of your brotherhood and society i will never give you a farthing nor collect any more alms nor make any feasts for you nor take the least notice of you any more than i would of the meanest saint in the calendar  at last says costigan we reached the quay where all the rest of the company had landed before us and got home about eleven oclock strangely amused with the odd variety of this days entertainment which must have cost the marquis little short of  00l  the amusements of the portuguese are much the same with those of the spaniards bullfeasts balls concerts promenades and dull miserable performances of comedies these are taken either from some subjects in the sacred writings or descriptive of low and obscene wit personified in the most vulgar characters  there is no public theater here at present says costigan the pious queen not choosing to permit such a school of immorality in a public manner much less would she suffer women to exhibit on the stage were it open being of opinion that to permit women thus to act in public would have too much the appearance of patronizing the favorite vice of her country for the principal object is to obviate public scandal and this agrees with a standing advice the old friars in this country are ever giving to the young ones  si non cast tantum modo caute  if you cannnot be chaste at least be cautious  accordingly the wits here say her majesty by virtue of her absolute authority may prevent the women from acting in public but they thank god it is not in her power to prevent them from playing their parts in private the nobility however have private theaters in their villas in which are occasionally exhibited dramatic entertainments  in one of these theatrical pieces says costigan to which we were invited we were presented with a comedy representing the creation of the world and we saw the eternal father padre eterno with a long white beard descend in a cloud with a great number of lights and angels about him to give orders for its creation  the next scene presented us with the serpent tempting eve and his infernal majesty passing the most exaggerated encomiums on her beauty in order to engage her to eat which as soon as she had done and made adam do the same there came a terrible storm of thunder and lightning in the midst of which was a dance of infernal spirits with the devil in the middle all in high glee and congratulating their monarch on the success of his schemes against mankind the devil was dressed in black with scarlet stockings long ruffles and a broad lace on his hat with a large feather to it all of the same flaming color while diverting himself in this manner a loud and solemn voice from behind the scenes pronounced the name of jesus on which the whole company of devils sunk immediately under the stage through trapdoors that sent forth flames and smoke  as soon as the scene shifted the eternal father was seen again descending with great wrath he immediately called for noah who was ready in waiting and told him he was so provoked by the wickedness of mankind that he was determined to drown them all together and regretted he should have created such a scurvy set of fellows here the piety of noah interceded and it was agreed at last that noah should build an ark according to the directions the eternal father gave him he therefore ordered noah to go to the royal dock at lisbon and call john gonsalves the name of the present master builder whom he desired noah to employ assuring him he preferred john gonsalvess method of building ships to those of all their boasted french and english builders after which the eternal father went up to heaven and noah to build his ark  the next scene represented s christopher like a giant our savior who was represented as a boy about  0 or    years old and the devil dressed as before the prince of darkness complained grievously of the irreparable mischief done to him and his kingdom by the coming of christ he said that he could now scarce put his foot in any corner of the earth without meeting with christians and saints he asked the saint what kind of conscience his master must have who was for taking all to himself and leaving kim nothing though he must be sensible it was more the fear of him than any love for his antagonist that made so many christians and desired the saint would introduce him to christ that so they might settle their affairs in an amicable manner s christopher said he really did not know where to find jesus christ at present but believed that he was with his father and mother at heliopolis in egypt the devil said he had not time to go so far that night but to the best of his remembrance he thought the little boy he had with him very much resembled jesus christ when he saw him about  00 years since going into the temple at jerusalem the saint assured him that he was not christ and the little boy himself declared that so far from being christ he was only the son of a poor carpenter at nazareth who with the sweat of his brow was scarce able to earn enough to purchase a couple of pilchards and a bit of brown bread for himself and his mother  after this s christopher and the devil had a long conversation upon the nature of the trinity which concluded with the devils telling the saint it was such an intricate contradictory piece of business that he owned he could not comprehend a syllable of it upon this the saint tells the devil he must be a great blockhead and a most egregious ass for that nothing was more plain and selfevident and that he would make it appear so to him in an instant on this he took up with his left hand the skirt of his garment and with his right making a fold of part of it said here is one then making another fold here are two afterward making a third he asked him if that was not three and the other answering in the affirmative the saint dropped the folds and stretched out all that part of his garment between his hands in one piece without any folds and the devil after so palpable a demonstration acknowledged he clearly understood the trinity  this matter being discussed the little boy begged s christopher to carry him on his shoulders over a deep and rapid river that ran near them to this the saint consented though the devil cautioned him how he meddled with the boy of whom he still had his doubts who he really was however the saint took him up but before he got to the middle of the river was ready to sink under his burden and began to call out at which the devil laughed heartily and asked him why he would not follow his advice the boy said to the devil while on his shoulders in the water if atlas had found the weight of the poles such a load that he could hardly bear it no wonder christopher that though a giant you should find me much heavier who created not only the world but the sun the moon and all the planetary system on the boys saying this the saint found himself relieved and setting him down on the other side fell upon his knees to worship him and then making the sign of the cross over the water on the devil the prince of darkness immediately vanished into flame and smoke leaving a strong sulphurous smell behind him  the piece concluded with a scene of some nuns in conversation with their gallants at the parlour grate of a convent after many bombast declarations of their passion interspersed with double entendres the ladies desire the gentlemen to entertain them with a dance which they do by dancing some obscene dances practiced only by the blacks and this part of the entertainment meets with great applause  the afterpiece to this comedy was equally ludicrous the scene lay in a coblers shop who was at work with his wife near him rather handsome than otherwise and two friars who casting a leering look at his wife but were at the same time engaged in a deep dispute with the cobbler one of the friars insisted there could exist matter without form while the other was as strenuous in supporting a contrary opinion to which the cobbler seemed also inclined whilst his wife very prudently embraced both opinions in the mean time a young buck enters the shop and desires the cobbler to mend the strap of his shoebuckle on this the cobbler calls to his wife to know what money was in the house she replies a pieceofeight and seven reals the cobbler then turns to the buck and asks him if he was not ashamed to desire him to work for him when he heard he had so much money in the house and bids him get his strap mended where he pleased for he would work for no man while he was so rich the dispute between matter and form still went on in portuguese the words materia and forma signify matter and form and the word forma likewise signifies a shoemakers last the party who insisted matter could exist without form not producing one good reason in support of his argument and being very obstinate the cobbler on perceiving this said he would soon convince him so rising from his tripod in a rage and taking up his last or forma he threw it with such force at his antagonist as made a large cut on his forehead now said the cobbler exulting after what my forma has done i will answer for it there will be produced matter in abundance this turn of wit raised great applause in the house after which the cobbler the friars the buck and the coblers wife being each provided with a leather began beating one another round the stage to the great diversion of the spectators and this is the manner that the afterpieces in this country generally end  the manner of traveling in this country is similar to that in spain except that they have not so many carriages and go more by water their towns lying more on the seacoast and the mouths of the great river rising in spain emptying themselves here mules or litters are mostly used in traveling their horses which are very fiery and active serving only for short visits or in cavalcades these latter not being so strong and surefooted and consequently less able to climb the mountains than the mules is the reason that they are scarcely ever made use of in traveling  no person in lisbon is allowed to have horses to his carriage except the royal family foreign ministers and a few others every one makes use of mules portugal is said not to abound in horses and those which the portuguese have they are obliged to smuggle from spain the exportation of which are forbidden under very severe penalties there being no regular conveyances of carriages between the two kingdoms of spain and portugal for travelers those who do not choose to ride upon mules or to walk are obliged to hire  wheel chaises these carriages are near tolerably well hung and drawn by mules but travelso very slow that a person used to the rapid mode of conveyance by our mailcoaches and postcoaches has need of all his patience to support the tediousness of the journey  in all the great towns and villages on the road to oporto says costigan although there are no carriages to be met with there are miserable little asses constantly to be hired which fly like lightning to the next town where fresh ones are to be had but were you to beat them to death they would not go one step further this mode of traveling however is not dear being at the rate of twopence each portuguese league or not quite three farthings english per mile  chap iv commerce manufactures etc the portuguese carry on a very extensive trade from which they derive but little advantage being obliged to vend not only their own products but all the merchandise and riches brought home to them from their settlements in other parts of the globe to the europeans who trade with them especially the english for their grain and manufactured goods of all kinds with which they supply portugal both for its home consumption and its settlements abroad the merchandise which the portuguese furnish foreigners with are sea salt oil wine lemons seville and china oranges figs raisins almonds chestnuts and other fruits together with wool silk and other materials for manufactures but their chief commodities consist of imports from their own colonies particularly from brazil such as sugars tobacco cocoanuts ivory ebony brazilwood hides spices drugs gold pearls diamonds and other valuable gems  the portuguese shipping frequent but little the other countries of europe or the levant their voyages lying rather to the coasts of africa particularly to the goldcoasts whence they carry negroes to the brazils they meet there also with some gold and ivory they trade likewise to their east india colonies of goa diu and macao but this traffic once so very important is now much upon the decline brazil however continues a very plentiful treasure to them all foreigners are excluded from any commerce with brazil the portuguese however carry on a very considerable clandestine traffic with the spaniards which consists principally in an exchange of gold and silver by which each king is defrauded of his fifth from brazil the portuguese bring not only sugar and tobacco but likewise gold and diamonds of the quantity of gold annually brought into lisbon from thence some conjecture may be made from the amount of the kings fifth which one year with another is near  00000l consequently the annual produce of gold in brazil may be estimated at  000000 sterling the fleet which sails every year to brazil goes and returns in seven or eight months and when homeward bound is convoyed by some men of war ships from africa or the east indies come also in company with it  the neglect of agriculture has been taken notice of already and the same observation may be made of all arts and manufactures although this country possesses the finest materials of all kinds but these are disposed of rough to foreigners the portuguese indeed make a little linen and different kinds of strawwork and candy different kinds of fruits particularly oranges they have likewise some coarse silk and woollen manufactures but these are trifling articles and support but a very small part of the nation it also very much concerns all foreigners trading to portugal and particularly the english that the portuguese do not apply themselves to manufactures and they are therefore very industrious says busching to prevent it of which the manufactury for lookingglass set up some few years since at lisbon was a memorable instance  according to baretti the only articles that the portuguese export to any very considerable amount are oranges lemons and wine which england takes from them in large quantities but still the balance of trade is very much in favor of the english from the great demand for their manufactures in portugal  this branch of commerce the french and dutch have long been endeavoring to get from the english but their endeavors are not likely to prove successful one reason is that the english are more powerful at sea than either the french or the dutch and there is something in superior strength which will carry almost any point among nations as well as among individuals the other is that neither the french or dutch could purchase from the portuguese those large quantities of fruit and wine which the english take in part of payment for what they furnish if the portuguese should be inclined to purchase the manufactures they receive from england either from the french or the dutch the english without commencing hostilities have only to provide themselves elsewhere with wine and fruit and the portuguese are halfruined it is therefore probable that the commerce between portugal and england will continue in its present state as long as the inhabitants of this latter country shall continue fond of the bottle and the bowl unless some singular revolution should happen in the government of the country of the former and according to costigan some such revolution seems fast approaching for says he to my certain knowledge the prince of asturias who is now on the throne of spain has said more than once that he considers portugal as a province wrested from him which he will make it his business to reunite to his other possessions no doubt the project would be as easily accomplished as the conquest would be important were not england to interfere which does not seem to enter at all into the calculation of the above writer  tobacco is not allowed to be cultivated in any part of portugal under pain of death all kinds of it as well as snuff excepting those which come from the brazils are strictly prohibited the tobacco is of two sorts the one is dry leaves the price of which is   s   d per pound the other rolled up in pieces of an inch thick and five or six inches long this sort is very black wet and stinking and sells at about half the price of the other the snuff is of the fine dust known in england by the name of brazil snuff  the usual method of reckoning in portugal is by reis and crusados the first is their smallest brass coin  000 of which are equal to a pound sterling the other is a silver coin of about two shillings and eightpence value their brass coins as well as their silver ones are of different degrees of value some are single reis others reis and a half and some are for five and ten reis they have also silver coins from  0 to  00 reis besides which they stamp the number  00 on the spanish pieces of eight to signify they may be taken for  00 reis their gold coins are the moidore valued at  000 reis the half moidore quarter moidore etc  chap v history constitution government etc we will now give the leading traits in the portuguese history from the time that the moors made a conquest of it in the eighth century who divided it like spain into a number of small principalities in the   th century the moors were driven from thence by alphonso one of their counts who was proclaimed king by the name of alphonso i it was not however till the   th century under john ii that the portuguese became powerful and acquired any territories in the indian seas this monarch projected the passage round the cape of good hope to the east indies and built the castle of minas on the coast of guinea his predecessor alphonso v had before taken several very strong places on the african coast john ii was succeeded by emanuel who married isabella daughter of ferdinand the catholic it was under him that portugal arrived at the highest pitch of its glory the portuguese were then sole masters of the commerce between india and europe which had before been carried on by the venetians and other maritime states in the mediterranean through egypt and by the channel of the red sea in making their frequent voyages into the indian seas the portuguese by chance discovered the brazils in america and several rich countries on the coast of africa from all which flowed such immense treasures into portugal during this reign as to give this period of their history the appellation of the golden age emanuel died in the beginning of the   th century and was succeeded by his son john iii whose reign was fortunate and prosperous this monarch applied his endeavors to restore arts and sciences in portugal and to people those colonies which had been so lately discovered in asia africa and america his successor not satisfied with the immense territories he possessed undertook an expedition into africa against the moors under pretense of rousing the courage of his subjects and reviving that military discipline which was almost lost sight of by a long continuance of peace and plenty the opportunity seemed favorable the moors having at that time just deposed their sovereign the issue however proved disastrous the portuguese advancing too far into the country were surrounded by a more numerous army of the moors and totally defeated the king and most of the nobility who attended him were slain and all the rest either cut to pieces or taken prisoners this blow the portuguese never recovered but soon after fell under the dominion of spain this happened under philip the seconds reign who claimed the kingdom in right of his mother and sent the duke of alva at the head of an army to take possession of it  king philip having thus united portugal to spain the portuguese became great sufferers by the union for philip being at that time endeavoring to reduce his rebellious subjects in the netherlands to their allegiance thought nothing would so much contribute to it as prohibiting their carrying on any commerce either with spain or portugal but this prohibition turned out very contrary to his expectations for the dutch being excluded from trading with spain and portugal from whence they used to bring spices and other valuable merchandise fitted out strong fleets themselves which they not only sent to the east and west indies in search of these commodities but likewise drove the portuguese from some of their best settlements in india and different parts of asia as well as from others that they had in the brazils and on the coast of africa  this exasperated the portuguese so much that they would gladly have shaken off the spanish yoke but philip ii maintained his dominion over them as did philip iii philip iv also succeeded peaceably to the united kingdoms which he enjoyed about    years but the spaniards having been weakened by a long and expensive war with france and the revolt of the catalonians the portuguese had a fair opportunity of delivering their country from the spanish yoke which they embraced and as the duke of braganza was the next in blood to their former princes they made him an offer of the crown of which he did not seem very ambitious but while revolving on the one hand the danger of the enterprise and on the other the glory that would accrue to his country and to his family in particular if he succeeded the court of spain having some information of the design philip summoned the duke and others of the portuguese nobility to attend him to the catalonian war the duke saw the snare and excused himself as well as he could pretending his finances were low a remittance of  0000 pistoles were immediately sent him with a promise of accommodating him with more things being thus brought to a crisis the duke consulted his duchess on the occasion she was of the family of medina sidonia a princess of great spirit and is said to have answered him thus sir if you go to spain you run the risk of your life you do the same in attempting the crown of portugal but if you must die it is better to die a king than a duke and this it seems determined his choice the whole kingdom of portugal and all their foreign settlements unanimously acknowledged him for their sovereign except ceuta in which was a spanish governor thus was this surprising revolution effected in an instant without having cost the lives of more than three people one of which was the viceroy who having in the commotion concealed himself in his library under a parcel of books was betrayed by an old female servant dragged forth and put to death by the people though it afterward cost a great deal of blood and treasure to maintain it it was undertaken on the first of december    0 when in the service of the church for that day are the following words from st pauls epistle to the romans chapter    v ii and that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed these words the portuguese did then and have ever since regarded as an oracle from heaven declaring in their favor thus did this prince ascend the throne of portugal and was proclaimed by the name of john iv it was thought very strange that this design should have been communicated to above  00 persons and a whole year taken up in preparation for its execution and yet not be discovered by the court of spain till it was too late to prevent it the new king however had not been long upon the throne before a plot was formed against him  we will here enumerate the several countries territories and islands subject to the crown of portugal which are first the country of brazil in america this is a vast tract of land extending along the seacoasts of southamerica it is the most considerable of all their foreign possessions and yields great quantities of gold tobacco sugar cotton ginger indigo hides etc in africa they have the fortress masagan in the kingdom of morocco part of the guinea coast angola on the coast of congo with some islands on the caffra coast zanguebar mozambic and quiloa on the eastern coast of africa in the atlantic ocean they have the western islands of the azores madeira and the islands of cape verde and some others in asia they still possess goa diu daman and chaul on the indian coast with a large extent of country and the island of macao on the southern coast of china which though under the government of the chinese is inhabited chiefly by the portuguese and here we cannot help remarking what a noble empire the portuguese possessed in asia and africa about   0 years ago they were then masters of ormus and the persian gulf of all the coast of india siam and malacca of the seacoasts on the islands of sumatra java and ceylon of the islands of molucca and banda where only the fine spices are to be met with they had established their religion in the islands of japan where they made such a number of proselytes that the sovereigns apprehensive of a general revolt totally extirpated them as well as their religion they had also planted their religion throughout the vast empire of china and might have maintained it there had not the jesuits interfered there are now indeed no remains of it in either of these places and the dutch have expelled them from all their valuable settlements on the continent and in the islands of asia except goa and two or three more inconsiderable places but they were so long possessed of the trade of these countries and had such numerous settlements that we find their language with some corruption still prevailing in those parts and a mixed breed of portuguese and indian who imitate the portuguese in their religion habits and customs on the eastern and western coasts of africa their religion and language are also every where to be met with though they have now very little power in that quarter of the globe  the government of portugal is an unlimited monarchy but with respect to the imposition of new taxes the settlement of the succession and other important concerns the consent of the states which consist of the clergy principal nobility and commons is necessary the clergy are represented as in spain by the archbishops and bishops the principal nobility are the dukes marquisses counts viscounts and barons and the representatives of the commons consist of the procurators or agents of the cities and towns among the commonalty are also reckoned the lower nobility and the masterships of the orders of knighthood this assembly never meets but by proclamation from the king in which they are styled cortes the last was held in the year      although the crown of portugal is hereditary yet the consent of the several states is also necessary to the succession of brothers children the crown devolves to the female line but this right is forfeited if they marry out of the kingdom in the year      it was confirmed by a manifesto of the states that in cases relating to succession the jus representationis should be admitted  the nobility are very numerous and many of them of the blood royal being descended from natural sons of the royal family they were formerly more considerable than at present although so much of the ancient custom by which the king conferred a maintenance on the nobility still remains that he assigns them a pension from a certain fund to enable them to maintain their dignity and this is a memorial of the ancient moradias as it was called or attendance salary for such of the nobility as become impoverished or disabled in the kings service there is likewise a public foundation at belem not far from lisbon where they have every thing provided for them in a very decent manner all those who are grandees and styled dons like those of spain consist of three classes and receive from the royal treasury a pension sufficient to support their respective dignities the inferior nobility or gentry are termed fidalgos and are incapable of bearing the title of don unless by permission from the king the macos fidalgos or gentlemen born are accounted of higher rank than citizens who acquire the title of cavallero fidalgo without being enobled by it  the kings eldest son is styled prince of brazil the other children and brothers being called infants the kings title runs thus  by the grace of god king of portugal and the algarves on this and the other side of the sea of africa lord of guinea and of the conquests trade and navigation in ethiopia arabia persia india etc  the principal order of knighthood in this kingdom is the order of christ instituted by king dennis soon after the abolition of the knights templars and confirmed in the year      by pope john xxii the insignia of this is a red cross within a white one the seat of the order is at the city of thomar it has     commanders concerning the origin of the order of s james writers differ but it is said to have been raised about the year  0 0 from the fraternity of some other orders and to have received the confirmation of pope alexander iii the badge of this order is a red sword in the shape of a cross resembling the handles of ancient swords to this order belong    small towns and places and   0 commanderies besides the splendid convent of santos o novo to the west of lisbon  the third order in portugal that of aviz is said to have been instituted so early as the year      by king alphonso henriques the seat of this order is at aviz in the province of alentejo its commanderies are only    in number and the badge belonging to it a green cross in the form of a lily these three orders are all religious with liberty of marriage to the knights the kings of portugal are perpetual grand masters the knights of malta have likewise    commanderies here  all the principal affairs of the kingdom are transacted in the council of state who have the disposal of all ecclesiastical and temporal posts and offices not immediately dependent on some other board or tribunal but even these at last come before the council of state particularly the nomination of the archbishops and bishops viceroys captains general governors of provinces etc is determined in this council peace and war embassies alliances etc are likewise canvassed in it the council is said to have been first instituted by queen catharine during the minority of king sebastian in the year      it consisted of five ecclesiastics and an equal number of lay officers the secretary of state is also a member of it and is assisted by the official mayor and others  the council of the palace is the highest tribunal to which causes may be brought from inferior courts by appeal it nominates to all offices belonging to the law decides disputes of jurisdiction between the lay and spiritual courts examines the briefs of the popes nuncios and besides a great variety of other business draws up all laws orders edicts confirmations privileges grants etc this court consists of a president and several counselors whose number is not limited  the casa da supplicaca is the first and highest tribunal of justice being without appeal in civil or criminal cases for the inferior administration of justice each of the six provinces of which the kingdom consists is divided into judicial districts consisting of a certain number of towns and villages these again are subdivided into inferior jurisdictions there is also another division of them all jurisdictions are either correicoens or ouvidorias the former belong to the crown the latter to the donatorios who are partly ecclesiastics and partly laymen the judge whom the crown appoints for its district is styled corregidor and the donatorian is styled ouvidor the roman law with the glossaries is recognized in portugal besides which there are royal edicts and the canon law and popes mandates  justice seems to be very singularly administered in this country according to what information we can collect in almost all civil suits and litigations sentences are obtained in favor of that party which can muster the most powerful empenhos preserving only the exterior forms and appearance of justice and these for evident reasons are duly executed in criminal processes when the truth is even come at and sentence duly passed it is seldom or ever put in execution unless indeed when a culprit is declared innocent for then with a small empenho he commonly obtains his liberty and even when capitally convicted he can by the same means obtain an eternal prorogation of the execution of the sentence  an empenho says costigan is the act whereby a person in habits of friendship or intimate acquaintance with another invested with power or authority interposes earnestly with him in favor of a third person in order to procure for him some special favor he does not always deserve or to avert from him the imposition of those pains and penalties to which he becomes liable by law  we will here give an example on this head which may enable our readers to form some idea of what the point of honor is to be held in this country two cousinsgerman both men of some property one a widower living upon his estate with a maiden sister to take care of his family the other an officer in a regiment of infantry entertained a most violent jealousy of each other on account of a lady to whom they both made pretensions this jealousy arose to such a pitch of frantic rage on the part of the widower that he went out one day well armed and accompanied by servants and meeting his cousin the officer ordered him to be seized and in his presence horsewhipped by a negro slave he brought with him for the purpose the officer being without arms and unprovided for such an attack after receiving the stripes laid hold of his own beard and told him he should certainly pay him for such an atrocious insult the widower who perfectly understood the meaning of the expression left this part of the country for above three years retiring into the kingdom of gallicia after which thinking his cousins passion must be in some degree cooled he returned to his estate never venturing however abroad but in the same litter with his sister not supposing any cavalier would be rude enough to attack him in the company of a lady in the mean while the officer from the time he was horsewhipped never appeared more in the regiment never went to mass nor shaved his beard having solemnly sworn to do neither of the three till he had taken what is here reckoned satisfaction for such an affront he continued all the whole time skulking about the country disguised like a hermit and having found his cousin was returned he got together some companions and waylaid him near his house as he was returning to it one evening with his sister in the litter which he stopped and telling the lady he had some little business with her brother most politely desired she would alight he then took a pistol from his sleeve and applied to his cousins forehead and after discharging the contents dragged him out of the litter and discharged another through his heart as he lay weltering in his blood this being done he asked a thousand pardons of the lady for having so far incommoded her and begged to know where she wished to be conducted she signified a desire to retire to a convent about ten miles from where the catastrophe happened where she had an only sister a nun and the officer like a gallant cavalier conducted and lodged her safely with her sister  this done he returned to his regiment reported himself fit for duty and dressed and appeared on the parade as usual and the rumor of this cowardly assassination getting wind he readily acknowledged it and what was more astonishing all the nobility and officers in the neighborhood justified the action saying it was the least a man of rank and credit could do to retrieve his reputation  mean time the whole process of the murder with the examination of the witnesses to which the civil magistrate of the district is by law enjoined to proceed within a limited time after notice of the same was remitted to the commanding officer of the regiment on whom it was incumbent as the delinquent was of the army to order his being tried by a court martial agreeable to the articles of war this was accordingly done and sentence of death passed on him which would have been put in immediate execution had it not been for the strong and numberless empenhos his relations made for him at court whereby the king changed his sentence ordering him to be broke at the head of his regiment his uniform to be stripped from his back his sash cut in two his sword to be broken before him and he himself to be banished for ten years to the kingdom of angola in africa the first part of his sentence was executed and he was kept in prison to be transported by the first opportunity but strange to relate the present queen on the change of administration not only pardoned every thing but ordered him to be restored to his post in the regiment  the revenues of the crown amount to about   00000 sterling there arise from the hereditary estates of the house of braganza from the royal demesnes and from the customs and duties on goods which are excessive foreign merchandise likewise pays    percent on importation and fish from newfoundland    per cent fish taken in the adjoining seas and rivers pays    per cent and the tax upon lands and houses when sold is  0 per cent the king likewise draws a considerable revenue from the several orders of knighthood of which as it is observed he is grand master his revenue has also been greatly increased by the suppression of the jesuits and other religious orders by the sale of indulgencies a large sum is annually levied this privilege the pope renews to the king every three years by a special bull including three others namely a bull for the living a bull for the dead and a bull of composition by virtue of which the payment of certain part of an iniquitous gain renders the rest legal the monopoly of brazil snuff produces a considerable revenue in      this article was farmed for  000000 of crusados we have already observed that the king has likewise one fifth of all the gold brought from brazil estimated one year with another at  00000l to this may be added the farm of the brazil diamonds no wonder therefore his revenue is so very ample considering the extent of the country  the military force in portugal consists of    regiments of foot each of   0 men including officers and    regiments of cavalry of  00 horse to each the horses are of different sizes and colors and make a very uncouth appearance in their troops are a great number of british officers who are mostly protestants and scotchmen it appears from baretti that since the war in      there has been a considerable reform in the portuguese army and that their soldiers which before were some of the worst and most beggarly looking troops in europe are now in general picked men and as well disciplined as the prussians themselves  s anthony of padua was formerly says twiss the generalissimo of the portuguese army his appointments were  00000 reis or about   l a year but lately the count de la lip supplied the saints place who it appears has introduced a considerable reform into the army this officer says twiss was formerly governor of almeida and the whole province of beira and is in every respect worthy of the high dignity to which he is raised he has been in the portuguese service ever since the year      the british officers here have the same pay as in the english service which is double that of the portuguese  the mode of recruiting the army in portugal says costigan is similar to that in spain and totally different from that which is practiced in england each of the provinces as we have already observed is divided into districts and the civil magistrate of every district is obliged to furnish the number of recruits allotted him when called upon by government and such recruits must be the sons of merchants tradesmen peasants laborers etc etc inhabitants of that district and the father brother some relation or other sufficient person is made responsible for each recruit that he shall behave well and not desert his colors and if he does that person is obliged to find another to serve in his place for whom he must also be responsible  they have even required this pledge of responsibility from s anthony the titular saint of lisbon whom their bigotry has appointed captain in one of their regiments and for whose security the queen of angels for so they style the virgin mary is made responsible costigan has transcribed a curious memorial signed by the commanding officer of the regiment and bearing date so late in the present century as the year      which was presented to the prime minister praying that s anthony who had been a captain in his regiment ever since the year      and had constantly done his duty with the greatest alacrity at the head of his company upon all occasions both in peace and war might be appointed aggregatemajor of the said regiment i do certify says the major that having carefully examined all the papers and registers of the regiment since its first formation there is not any note of bad behavior or irregularity committed by s anthony nor of his having ever been flogged imprisoned or any way punished by his officers while private in the regiment that during the whole time he has been a captain now near  00 years he has constantly done his duty with the greatest alacrity and as such has been seen by his soldiers times without number as they are all ready to testify and in every other respect has always behaved himself like a gentleman and an officer on all which accounts i hold him most worthy and deserving of the rank of aggregatemajor to our regiment and of every other honor grace or favor her majesty shall be graciously pleased to bestow upon him in testimony whereof i have hereto signed my name this   th of march       magalhaens homem  that a man entrusted with the command of a regiment should be at the close of the eighteenth century in such a lamentable state of bigotry seems scarcely credible costigan observes very justly that people will be apt to imagine the above is only caricature but asserts very confidently that he has mentioned nothing but literal and sober matters of fact  this memorial was farther accompanied with    certificates says the above writer with the cipher of the commandingofficers name set close by each number containing a true and faithful relation of the miracles and other eminent services the said s anthony had at different times performed in the regiment in consequence of his having a place in it among others he had restored a favorite lapdog to the commanding officers lady which had been stolen from her and which she had despaired of ever seeing again till her father director advised her to importune s anthony which she had no sooner done than the dog was brought back to her he also saved a poor soldier who called upon him when drowning as he passed a deep river by miraculously throwing a rope in his way another had recovered from the smallpox by thinking on s anthony and this after the rattle was in his throat and he had been given over by the surgeonmajor of the regiment in short another certificate related that a drummer of the regiment being in bed with his wife and their child sleeping between them when he waked in the morning found a large snake which had crept in under the door of the hut in bed with them sucking his wifes breast while she was fast asleep with its tail in the mouth of the child who was sucking at it very contentedly at sight of such an extraordinary appearance the drummer immediately invoked the captain of the regiment s anthony who inspired him with presence of mind and courage sufficient to seize at once the head and tail of the serpent by this time overloaded with the quantity of milk he had sucked and setting a foot upon each secured him from doing them any mischief till with his hanger which lay at his bedshead he cut the animals head off and mangled it so as to prevent it from hurting them thus the man wife and child had a miraculous escape  the navy of the portuguese according to twiss consists only of    men of war and four frigates several of the former are commanded by british officers  chap vi state of literature literature seems to be at a very low ebb in portugal at coimbra and evora there are two universities but whilst the papal power continues at its present height in that country science is like to make but an indifferent figure lisbon has only some schools and a royal academy established for portuguese history whose motto restituet omni promises mighty things and some good historical pieces have been already published in it the university of coimbra is said to be much the most considerable and to consist of  000 students but then they admit children before they are well read so that our grammarschools may be put on a footing with many of their colleges it is likewise said that they do not apply themselves so much to philosophy divinity or physic in these universities as to the study of the civil and canon law which is very much attended to in portugal and besides these each student makes himself acquainted with the customs of his particular province by which the magistrates are often governed in their decisions  there is likewise an academy of history antiquities and languages at santarene and at s thomass there is an academy of sciences on the plan of that of paris in      an italian capuchin published a work at valencia in spain in the portuguese language consisting of four volumes in quarto entitled verbadeiro methodo de estudar and dedicated to the kingdom of portugal setting forth the wretched state of the sciences there and the contemptible manner in which they are taught he even charges the portuguese with aiming at the perpetuity of ignorance and the triumph of barbarism he decries their schools as the places of retreat for those errors which by descartes and newton had been driven from other parts of europe and at their universities the mind he says is obscured with the abstruce disquisition of scholastic learning according to him gallileo descartes gassendi and newton are in portugal the names of atheists and heretics not to be mentioned but with marks of execration and lastly he affirms that the professor of anatomy in a portuguese university is allowed only two sheep a year for demonstrating his lectures if this be going too far let us hear what a portuguese himself dolivaira says in the preface to the first volume of his memoirs he uses these remarkable words in our country we live in ignorance without knowing it but in going out of portugal our eyes seem suddenly to open and we immediately see that ignorance in which we were involved the ignorance i speak of says he is evident foreigners allow us understanding docility morals discernment and a genius for comprehending what is commendable and good but our conceit our gravity our confined manner of living which deprives us of all freedom of thought exposes us to just censures and give rise to those hateful opinions which other nations entertain of us the main source of our ignorance and a miserable cause of offense to all nations is the custom in portugal of prohibiting such numbers of books  baretti in mentioning the state of literature in this country observes that few of their writers ever had a name even before the earthquake committed that ravage on their literature ossorio the latin historian was certainly a name of some consideration in the literary world and the fame of camoens the portuguese epic poet has traveled beyond alcenteja and estramadura yet the works of these two their most celebrated authors are more commended than read one of their sacred writers adds baretti called vieira is in high esteem with the portuguese i opened one of his volumes in the library of the royal convent at mafra and chance directed my eyes to a sermon where the perfections of the circular figure were pompously enumerated after which the lusitanian cicero as he is styled by the portuguese proceeds to tell his audience that if the supreme being were to show himself under any geometrical figure it would be the circular one in preference to the triangular the square the pentagonal the duodecagonal or any other known to the geometricians such is the display of literature by an author in high repute with the portuguese  they have a translation of the operas of metastasio to which by way of embellishment the translator has added scenes of his own in which when the heroes of the opera go out their place is supplied by the servants chambermaid and nurses of the principal characters who are introduced holding dialogues together achilles has his running footman semiramis her drynurse and deidamia has a little prating hussy of a cookmaid who bids the negroboy carry chocolate to his mistress such is the dramatic taste in portugal of which we have already given some considerable specimens under the article of amusements  the portuguese however have a dictionary of their own language which is much commended both by themselves and by foreigners but it does not appear to have been the work of a native it is said to be a compilation of father bluteau a french jesuit it is printed in eight or nine large quarto volumes  in a medical treatise says baretti that i met with in the royal library i read of a remedy for sore eyes not a little curious the person thus afflicted remarks the portuguese physician must not read nor fix his eyes upon any thing that is white  the escolas necessidades the principal seminary in lisbon is a philippine convent and of course the professors are philippine friars the jesuits were formerly indulged with the exclusive privilege of instructing the portuguese youth at lisbon but soon after their expulsion this honor was conferred on the philippines it is a certain fact says baretti that the jesuits in italy endeavored to subvert all literature his arguments in favor of this position are that before this order was instituted there were in that country so many eminent writers in various branches of science from dante to galileo as few countries could boast but says baretti the jesuits had no sooner got possession of the schools under pretext of instructing our youth gratis than there was an almost total cessation of historians politicians philosophers and poets they began by discouraging an application to the greek language asserting that it was totally unnecessary afterward by means of their voluminous latin grammars they rendered the study of this language next to impossible as it is next to impossible to learn any thing by the assistance of something equally unknown to us they even contaminated our language by inundating it with such a deluge of equivocal wit as to make us the ridicule of those nations of whom we were before the admiration  in portugal to have substituted the philippians for the jesuits has not added much to the literary fame of the country it is however intended to put the seminaries in the capital on a more respectable footing than they are at present a university is to be established at lisbon into which some coimbra professors are to be incorporated and the ancient one in that city to be totally suppressed perhaps the time is fast approaching when the portuguese will likewise emerge from ignorance and superstition and put themselves on a level at least with some of the catholic nations  chap vii religion that christianity was propagated here by the apostles james and john so early as the first century which the portuguese assert cannot be proved but it is certain as appears from tertullian that it was received all over spain to which portugal was then annexed in the second century and in the third new parishes were formed in succeeding times the moors and jews who had been much increasing lived intermingled with the christians and notwithstanding the severe persecutions under john ii whereby they were forced externally to acknowledge the romish church and though all exercise of the jewish religion be still prohibited by the fundamental laws of the kingdom yet there are great numbers of secret jews among the portuguese even at present and those too even among the nobility bishops prebends monks and nuns and the very inquisitors themselves many unable to conceal themselves escape into holland and there openly profess judaism the established religion of the country however is the roman catholic and the inquisition which was introduced by king john iii and has since been set up throughout all the portuguese dominions brazil excepted is very active in detecting heresies and heretics and no less rigorous in punishing them of the inquisitions in portugal there are four high courts at lisbon coimbra evora and goa in the east indies each of which is independent though with some subordination to the supreme council of inquisition impious and inhuman as this tribunal is yet its festival or solemn burnings called auto da fe or the act of faith afford the highest delight to the bigoted portuguese who whilst their fellow creatures the supposed heretics are burning in flames shout que grande clemencia bente abencoado sea o santo officio i e o what great goodness praised be the holy office even the principal nobility deem it an honor to lead the condemned criminals like mean servants to the stake king john iv however in some measure curtailed the power of the holy office commanding that all its sentences should be laid before the parliament and that the accused should be allowed counsel for their defense he likewise further enacted that only blasphemy sodomy polygamy heresy sorcery pagan customs and the conversion of the jews are to come under their cognizance to be a christam velho i e an ancient christian or of an ancient christian race is accounted in portugal a very great preeminence and far above a christamnovo or newly converted christian or a temparte de christam novo a half new converted christian by which last are to be understood those whose new converted ancestors married ancient christians  no sovereigns have shown themselves more zealous for the catholic religion than the kings of spain and portugal who have suffered the inquisition to ravage their territories for such a number of years nor are the people less devout than their sovereigns it is not unusual even for the fair sex to resort to the churches seven or eight times a day though this has been suggested to arise from an inclination to gallantry and rambling abroad they being never suffered to leave their houses but to go to their devotions the portuguese are in general great admirers of the external pomp and splendor of church worship in the holy week they practice great severities upon themselves some will procure themselves to be fastened to a cross in their shirts with their arms extended in imitation of our blessed savior uttering all the time the most dismal groans and lamentations others will walk barefooted over rocks and mountains to some distant shrine in order to perform their devotions during lent in those parts of portugal which are at a distance from the sea they eat only the entrails of beasts at this holy season friars and priests may be seen in all the great streets and squares preaching to the people but applying to their passions rather than to their understandings the preacher frequently beats his breast and weeps in the midst of his discourse and the people follow his example  solemn processions are very frequent in portugal but the most considerable one is on good friday when all the religious orders attend with the members of the several tribunals and councils and sometimes even the king himself followed by his whole court with wax torches in their hands and the servants of the nobility and people of distinction following their masters with lighted flambeaux upon such an occasion every thing wears a mournful appearance the guards who likewise attend have their arms covered with black as are the drums which beat a dead march in the same manner that they do at the funeral of a general the trumpets and other musical instruments sound most dismally and all the standards and crosses are covered with black crape true penitents in these processions lash and cut themselves unmercifully hoping to implore the protection of heaven by this holy violence whilst others are no less severe upon themselves to show their passion for their mistresses who stand in balconies to see the procession  such are the religious ceremonies of the portuguese on days of fasting and humiliation but on their festivals the scene is very different then all the treasures of their churches are exposed to public view the balconies and windows are hung with tapestry and the ladies dressed in a most magnificent attire are permitted to view the procession of the images without any lattices before them the images together with the relics and treasures of the churches are on these occasions accompanied by the nobility in their habits of gala preceded by music and dancing  these festivals are generally concluded by some comedy wretchedly acted containing a representation of the life and actions of some of their saints taken from their legends and from the familiarity with which not only the saints but even our savior is treated seem calculated rather to ridicule than promote christianity  the following anecdote will show the extreme bigotry that reigns among the most exalted ranks of people in this country and which could not be carried to a greater height even in the capital of the papal dominions some thieves during the reign of the present queen having broken into a country church about four leagues from lisbon and rummaging in the dark for plate and other plunder among the altars happened to overturn or break open a pix containing several consecrated wafers which were found next morning strewed on the ground near the altar and to add to the misfortune some of them were still missing when these circumstances were reported to the queen they threw her into the deepest affliction she shut herself up and was invisible for three days after which she said all the misfortunes of her late fathers reign and the judgments with which god had visited him such as earthquakes the expulsion of the jesuits and the war which followed were all together nothing when compared to the grievous insult offered to the body of our blessed savior himself and which it became her duty to apologize for after the most signal manner possible and after holding a consultation with the gravest and most orthodox divines the whole court were ordered into deep mourning for nine days at the end of which there was a general procession to the different churches in which the queen herself and the court walked in procession and which was called the procession of the disaggravation and by performing of which they conceived they should appease the wrath of the deity who had suffered such a gross affront by a few wafers being thrown about and lost as if there were any connection between the omnipotent creator of the universe and a wafer  what a crowd of reflections does not such flagrant and inveterate folly present to the consideration of every sensible and serious person here we plainly see into what a train of gross ludicrous and impious situations this belief of the real presence must continually bring them for ever led astray by the insolent and blasphemous opinion that the deity resembles a cruel and suspicious tyrant they think to appease every supposed insult offered him by slavish and overweening humiliations in order to anticipate the effects of that vengeance he was just about to wreak upon them  the number of convents in portugal is said to be no fewer than  00 and most of them are very rich the most remarkable and wealthy is the convent of the cistercians at alcobaca  with respect to ecclesiastical persons john v at a very great expense procured a patriarch obtaining in      the popes license to raise his courtchapel at lisbon to a patriarchate and in the year following the new patriarch who also retained the title of first courtchaplain was installed with very great solemnity in      the pope further granted that the patriarch should always be a cardinal and of the royal family the patriarchal church at lisbon was erected into a palatinate and the fourth part of all the ecclesiastical benefices in portugal assigned for the support of the new canons next are three archbishops who rank with marquisses and of them the first is the archbishop of braganza who is primate of the kingdom the bishops hold the rank of counts exclusive of those in europe the portuguese have also archbishops and bishops in the other three parts of the world  the king besides the nomination of all bishops receives one fourth of their revenue but this is generally given away in pensions the pope confirms the bishops publishes his bulls in the kingdom without any previous consent of the king and by his legate governs the clergy who with respect to taxes and contributions depend upon him he has also the gift of many small prebends the sums arising to the legates from these prerogatives are thought to exceed the revenues of the crown and the nuncios seldom fail of realizing immense fortunes before they return to rome  the pomp and splendor with which the sovereigns of portugal attend high mass on gala days is extremely magnificent and superb i was present says baretti at a grand gala instituted to commemorate the narrow escape of the late king who had very near been treacherously murdered by the duke aveiros and his associates two coaches full of priests led the procession fifty of the patriarchs servants two and two came next dressed in blue liveries trimmed with crimson silk lace all uncovered their hair well powdered and wearing large cloaks reaching to the ground then followed seven carriages belonging to his excellence the two first were occupied by his eminences ecclesiastical officers in the third was the patriarch himself excepting the pope there is no ecclesiastic in the whole world surrounded with so much pomp as the patriarch of portugal two priests walked by the side of his carriage each carrying in their hands an umbrella fringed with gold the patriarchs coach was lined both within and without with blue velvet and gilt and painted with great taste and elegance his state carriage followed after so very rich and fine says baretti that queen semiramis would not have thought it unworthy of her the three other coaches were likewise filled with his attendants each of the four first were drawn by six pied horses that is horses streaked with black and white which are not so uncommon in portugal as they are in other countries they all galloped but their galloping was so close and short that the attendants on foot could keep up with it though they walked with great slowness and solemnity the three next carriages had each six very fine mules the patriarch was dressed in his pontificate  whilst this noble procession was advancing toward the cathedral  0 other carriages each drawn by six mules made their appearance filled with the dignitaries of the lisbon cathedral  the king then came in a coach and six the horses black and white like the patriarchs surrounded with his body guards the queen followed immediately after with her daughters all in one coach with four more coaches each drawn by six horses her majesty was surrounded by a troop of her own horse guards she and the princesses were most magnificently dressed wearing very large hoops their heads necks breasts arms waists and feet glittering with jewels  in the pew they all knelt except the queen who sat down and began to read and kiss the leaves of her book as she did this repeatedly every instant i asked the meaning of it says baretti and was told that her majesty always kissed the name of god the virgin mary and all saints and angels in every book she read a custom somewhat similar to that of mr boil who used always to bow when the name of god was mentioned  as soon as they entered the church the patriarch quitting his throne went to the altar and celebrated a high mass assisted by his dignitaries and canons with the ceremonies observed by the cardinals to the pope when his holiness officiates in the most solemn functions during the mass the royal band played and sung most gloriously the ceremony lasted a full hour and was followed by the patriarchial benediction after which the company broke up and went home tired and fatigued with the excessive heat which as the sun shone very bright was quite intolerable  at some distance from the cathedral was a batallion of foot guards who were not allowed to fire upon this occasion as is the custom in some other catholic countries lest the horses and mules might be frightened and trample upon the people i was also much pleased adds baretti to hear several of the officers repeatedly order the horseguards to keep close together and ride gently that no person might be hurt this is a degree of attention in the military of portugal which travelers will not find in all countries and as connected with the government ought to be put in counterpoise to the calumnies
