chapter                               authors introduction   my dog had made a point on a piece of fallowground and led the curate and me two or three hundred yards over that and some stubble adjoining in a breathless state of expectation on a burning first of september  it was a false point and our labour was vain yet to do rover justice for hes an excellent dog though i have lost his pedigree the fault was none of his the birds were gone the curate showed me the spot where they had lain basking at the root of an old hedge  i stopped and cried hem  the curate is fatter than i he wiped the sweat from his brow  there is no state where one is apter to pause and look round one than after such a disappointment  it is even so in life  when we have been hurrying on impelled by some warm wish or other looking neither to the right hand nor to the left—we find of a sudden that all our gay hopes are flown and the only slender consolation that some friend can give us is to point where they were once to be found  and lo if we are not of that combustible race who will rather beat their heads in spite than wipe their brows with the curate we look round and say with the nauseated listlessness of the king of israel all is vanity and vexation of spirit  i looked round with some such grave apophthegm in my mind when i discovered for the first time a venerable pile to which the enclosure belonged  an air of melancholy hung about it  there was a languid stillness in the day and a single crow that perched on an old tree by the side of the gate seemed to delight in the echo of its own croaking  i leaned on my gun and looked but i had not breath enough to ask the curate a question  i observed carving on the bark of some of the trees twas indeed the only mark of human art about the place except that some branches appeared to have been lopped to give a view of the cascade which was formed by a little rill at some distance  just at that instant i saw pass between the trees a young lady with a book in her hand  i stood upon a stone to observe her but the curate sat him down on the grass and leaning his back where i stood told me that was the daughter of a neighbouring gentleman of the name of walton whom he had seen walking there more than once  some time ago he said one harley lived there a whimsical sort of man i am told but i was not then in the cure though if i had a turn for those things i might know a good deal of his history for the greatest part of it is still in my possession  his history said i  nay you may call it what you please said the curate for indeed it is no more a history than it is a sermon  the way i came by it was this some time ago a grave oddish kind of a man boarded at a farmers in this parish the country people called him the ghost and he was known by the slouch in his gait and the length of his stride  i was but little acquainted with him for he never frequented any of the clubs hereabouts  yet for all he used to walk anights he was as gentle as a lamb at times for i have seen him playing at teetotum with the children on the great stone at the door of our churchyard  soon after i was made curate he left the parish and went nobody knows whither and in his room was found a bundle of papers which was brought to me by his landlord  i began to read them but i soon grew weary of the task for besides that the hand is intolerably bad i could never find the author in one strain for two chapters together and i dont believe theres a single syllogism from beginning to end  i should be glad to see this medley said i  you shall see it now answered the curate for i always take it along with me ashooting how came it so torn  tis excellent wadding said the curate—this was a plea of expediency i was not in a condition to answer for i had actually in my pocket great part of an edition of one of the german illustrissimi for the very same purpose  we exchanged books and by that means for the curate was a strenuous logician we probably saved both  when i returned to town i had leisure to peruse the acquisition i had made i found it a bundle of little episodes put together without art and of no importance on the whole with something of nature and little else in them  i was a good deal affected with some very trifling passages in it and had the name of marmontel or a richardson been on the titlepage—tis odds that i should have wept but  one is ashamed to be pleased with the works of one knows not whom     chapter xi    on bashfulness—a character—his opinion on that subject   there is some rust about every man at the beginning though in some nations among the french for instance the ideas of the inhabitants from climate or what other cause you will are so vivacious so eternally on the wing that they must even in small societies have a frequent collision the rust therefore will wear off sooner but in britain it often goes with a man to his grave nay he dares not even pen a hic jacet to speak out for him after his death  let them rub it off by travel said the baronets brother who was a striking instance of excellent metal shamefully rusted  i had drawn my chair near his  let me paint the honest old man tis but one passing sentence to preserve his image in my mind  he sat in his usual attitude with his elbow rested on his knee and his fingers pressed on his cheek  his face was shaded by his hand yet it was a face that might once have been well accounted handsome its features were manly and striking a dignity resided on his eyebrows which were the largest i remember to have seen  his person was tall and wellmade but the indolence of his nature had now inclined it to corpulency  his remarks were few and made only to his familiar friends but they were such as the world might have heard with veneration and his heart uncorrupted by its ways was ever warm in the cause of virtue and his friends  he is now forgotten and gone  the last time i was at silton hall i saw his chair stand in its corner by the fireside there was an additional cushion on it and it was occupied by my young ladys favourite lap dog i drew near unperceived and pinched its ears in the bitterness of my soul the creature howled and ran to its mistress  she did not suspect the author of its misfortune but she bewailed it in the most pathetic terms and kissing its lips laid it gently on her lap and covered it with a cambric handkerchief  i sat in my old friends seat i heard the roar of mirth and gaiety around me poor ben silton  i gave thee a tear then accept of one cordial drop that falls to thy memory now  they should wear it off by travel—why it is true said i that will go far but then it will often happen that in the velocity of a modern tour and amidst the materials through which it is commonly made the friction is so violent that not only the rust but the metal too is lost in the progress  give me leave to correct the expression of your metaphor said mr silton that is not always rust which is acquired by the inactivity of the body on which it preys such perhaps is the case with me though indeed i was never cleared from my youth but taking it in its first stage it is rather an encrustation which nature has given for purposes of the greatest wisdom  you are right i returned and sometimes like certain precious fossils there may be hid under it gems of the purest brilliancy  nay farther continued mr silton there are two distinct sorts of what we call bashfulness this the awkwardness of a booby which a few steps into the world will convert into the pertness of a coxcomb that a consciousness which the most delicate feelings produce and the most extensive knowledge cannot always remove  from the incidents i have already related i imagine it will be concluded that harley was of the latter species of bashful animals at least if mr siltons principle is just it may be argued on this side for the gradation of the first mentioned sort it is certain he never attained some part of his external appearance was modelled from the company of those gentlemen whom the antiquity of a family now possessed of bare £  0 a year entitled its representative to approach these indeed were not many great part of the property in his neighbourhood being in the hands of merchants who had got rich by their lawful calling abroad and the sons of stewards who had got rich by their lawful calling at home persons so perfectly versed in the ceremonial of thousands tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands whose degrees of precedency are plainly demonstrable from the first page of the complete accomptant or young mans best pocket companion that a bow at church from them to such a man as harley would have made the parson look back into his sermon for some precept of christian humility     chapter xii of worldly interests   there are certain interests which the world supposes every man to have and which therefore are properly enough termed worldly but the world is apt to make an erroneous estimate ignorant of the dispositions which constitute our happiness or misery they bring to an undistinguished scale the means of the one as connected with power wealth or grandeur and of the other with their contraries  philosophers and poets have often protested against this decision but their arguments have been despised as declamatory or ridiculed as romantic  there are never wanting to a young man some grave and prudent friends to set him right in this particular if he need it to watch his ideas as they arise and point them to those objects which a wise man should never forget  harley did not want for some monitors of this sort  he was frequently told of men whose fortunes enabled them to command all the luxuries of life whose fortunes were of their own acquirement his envy was invited by a description of their happiness and his emulation by a recital of the means which had procured it  harley was apt to hear those lectures with indifference nay sometimes they got the better of his temper and as the instances were not always amiable provoked on his part some reflections which i am persuaded his goodnature would else have avoided  indeed i have observed one ingredient somewhat necessary in a mans composition towards happiness which people of feeling would do well to acquire a certain respect for the follies of mankind for there are so many fools whom the opinion of the world entitles to regard whom accident has placed in heights of which they are unworthy that he who cannot restrain his contempt or indignation at the sight will be too often quarrelling with the disposal of things to relish that share which is allotted to himself  i do not mean however to insinuate this to have been the case with harley on the contrary if we might rely on his own testimony the conceptions he had of pomp and grandeur served to endear the state which providence had assigned him  he lost his father the last surviving of his parents as i have already related when he was a boy  the good man from a fear of offending as well as a regard to his son had named him a variety of guardians one consequence of which was that they seldom met at all to consider the affairs of their ward and when they did meet their opinions were so opposite that the only possible method of conciliation was the mediatory power of a dinner and a bottle which commonly interrupted not ended the dispute and after that interruption ceased left the consulting parties in a condition not very proper for adjusting it  his education therefore had been but indifferently attended to and after being taken from a country school at which he had been boarded the young gentleman was suffered to be his own master in the subsequent branches of literature with some assistance from the parson of the parish in languages and philosophy and from the exciseman in arithmetic and bookkeeping  one of his guardians indeed who in his youth had been an inhabitant of the temple set him to read coke upon lyttelton a book which is very properly put into the hands of beginners in that science as its simplicity is accommodated to their understandings and its size to their inclination  he profited but little by the perusal but it was not without its use in the family for his maiden aunt applied it commonly to the laudable purpose of pressing her rebellious linens to the folds she had allotted them  there were particularly two ways of increasing his fortune which might have occurred to people of less foresight than the counsellors we have mentioned  one of these was the prospect of his succeeding to an old lady a distant relation who was known to be possessed of a very large sum in the stocks but in this their hopes were disappointed for the young man was so untoward in his disposition that notwithstanding the instructions he daily received his visits rather tended to alienate than gain the goodwill of his kinswoman  he sometimes looked grave when the old lady told the jokes of her youth he often refused to eat when she pressed him and was seldom or never provided with sugarcandy or liquorice when she was seized with a fit of coughing nay he had once the rudeness to fall asleep while she was describing the composition and virtues of her favourite cholicwater  in short be accommodated himself so ill to her humour that she died and did not leave him a farthing  the other method pointed out to him was an endeavour to get a lease of some crownlands which lay contiguous to his little paternal estate this it was imagined might be easily procured as the crown did not draw so much rent as harley could afford to give with very considerable profit to himself and the then lessee had rendered himself so obnoxious to the ministry by the disposal of his vote at an election that he could not expect a renewal  this however needed some interest with the great which harley or his father never possessed  his neighbour mr walton having heard of this affair generously offered his assistance to accomplish it  he told him that though he had long been a stranger to courtiers yet he believed there were some of them who might pay regard to his recommendation and that if he thought it worth the while to take a london journey upon the business he would furnish him with a letter of introduction to a baronet of his acquaintance who had a great deal to say with the first lord of the treasury  when his friends heard of this offer they pressed him with the utmost earnestness to accept of it  they did not fail to enumerate the many advantages which a certain degree of spirit and assurance gives a man who would make a figure in the world they repeated their instances of good fortune in others ascribed them all to a happy forwardness of disposition and made so copious a recital of the disadvantages which attend the opposite weakness that a stranger who had heard them would have been led to imagine that in the british code there was some disqualifying statute against any citizen who should be convicted of—modesty  harley though he had no great relish for the attempt yet could not resist the torrent of motives that assaulted him and as he needed but little preparation for his journey a day not very distant was fixed for his departure     chapter xiii the man of feeling in love   the day before that on which he set out he went to take leave of mr walton—we would conceal nothing—there was another person of the family to whom also the visit was intended on whose account perhaps there were some tenderer feelings in the bosom of harley than his gratitude for the friendly notice of that gentleman though he was seldom deficient in that virtue could inspire  mr walton had a daughter and such a daughter we will attempt some description of her by and by  harleys notions of the καλον or beautiful were not always to be defined nor indeed such as the world would always assent to though we could define them  a blush a phrase of affability to an inferior a tear at a moving tale were to him like the cestus of cytherea unequalled in conferring beauty  for all these miss walton was remarkable but as these like the abovementioned cestus are perhaps still more powerful when the wearer is possessed of some degree of beauty commonly so called it happened that from this cause they had more than usual power in the person of that young lady  she was now arrived at that period of life which takes or is supposed to take from the flippancy of girlhood those sprightlinesses with which some goodnatured old maids oblige the world at threescore  she had been ushered into life as that word is used in the dialect of st jamess at seventeen her father being then in parliament and living in london at seventeen therefore she had been a universal toast her health now she was fourandtwenty was only drank by those who knew her face at least  her complexion was mellowed into a paleness which certainly took from her beauty but agreed at least harley used to say so with the pensive softness of her mind  her eyes were of that gentle hazel colour which is rather mild than piercing and except when they were lighted up by goodhumour which was frequently the case were supposed by the fine gentlemen to want fire  her air and manner were elegant in the highest degree and were as sure of commanding respect as their mistress was far from demanding it  her voice was inexpressibly soft it was according to that incomparable simile of otways      —like the shepherds pipe upon the mountains     when all his little flocks at feed before him  the effect it had upon harley himself used to paint ridiculously enough and ascribed it to powers which few believed and nobody cared for  her conversation was always cheerful but rarely witty and without the smallest affectation of learning had as much sentiment in it as would have puzzled a turk upon his principles of female materialism to account for  her beneficence was unbounded indeed the natural tenderness of her heart might have been argued by the frigidity of a casuist as detracting from her virtue in this respect for her humanity was a feeling not a principle but minds like harleys are not very apt to make this distinction and generally give our virtue credit for all that benevolence which is instinctive in our nature  as her father had some years retired to the country harley had frequent opportunities of seeing her  he looked on her for some time merely with that respect and admiration which her appearance seemed to demand and the opinion of others conferred upon her from this cause perhaps and from that extreme sensibility of which we have taken frequent notice harley was remarkably silent in her presence  he heard her sentiments with peculiar attention sometimes with looks very expressive of approbation but seldom declared his opinion on the subject much less made compliments to the lady on the justness of her remarks  from this very reason it was that miss walton frequently took more particular notice of him than of other visitors who by the laws of precedency were better entitled to it it was a mode of politeness she had peculiarly studied to bring to the line of that equality which is ever necessary for the ease of our guests those whose sensibility had placed them below it  harley saw this for though he was a child in the drama of the world yet was it not altogether owing to a want of knowledge on his part on the contrary the most delicate consciousness of propriety often kindled that blush which marred the performance of it this raised his esteem something above what the most sanguine descriptions of her goodness had been able to do for certain it is that notwithstanding the laboured definitions which very wise men have given us of the inherent beauty of virtue we are always inclined to think her handsomest when she condescends to smile upon ourselves  it would be trite to observe the easy gradation from esteem to love in the bosom of harley there scarce needed a transition for there were certain seasons when his ideas were flushed to a degree much above their common complexion  in times not credulous of inspiration we should account for this from some natural cause but we do not mean to account for it at all it were sufficient to describe its effects but they were sometimes so ludicrous as might derogate from the dignity of the sensations which produced them to describe  they were treated indeed as such by most of harleys sober friends who often laughed very heartily at the awkward blunders of the real harley when the different faculties which should have prevented them were entirely occupied by the ideal in some of these paroxysms of fancy miss walton did not fail to be introduced and the picture which had been drawn amidst the surrounding objects of unnoticed levity was now singled out to be viewed through the medium of romantic imagination it was improved of course and esteem was a word inexpressive of the feelings which it excited     chapter xiv he sets out on his journey—the beggar and his dog   he had taken leave of his aunt on the eve of his intended departure but the good ladys affection for her nephew interrupted her sleep and early as it was next morning when harley came downstairs to set out he found her in the parlour with a tear on her cheek and her caudlecup in her hand  she knew enough of physic to prescribe against going abroad of a morning with an empty stomach  she gave her blessing with the draught her instructions she had delivered the night before  they consisted mostly of negatives for london in her idea was so replete with temptations that it needed the whole armour of her friendly cautions to repel their attacks  peter stood at the door  we have mentioned this faithful fellow formerly harleys father had taken him up an orphan and saved him from being cast on the parish and he had ever since remained in the service of him and of his son  harley shook him by the hand as he passed smiling as if he had said i will not weep  he sprung hastily into the chaise that waited for him peter folded up the step  my dear master said he shaking the solitary lock that hung on either side of his head i have been told as how london is a sad place  he was choked with the thought and his benediction could not be heard—but it shall be heard honest peter where these tears will add to its energy  in a few hours harley reached the inn where he proposed breakfasting but the fulness of his heart would not suffer him to eat a morsel  he walked out on the road and gaining a little height stood gazing on that quarter he had left  he looked for his wonted prospect his fields his woods and his hills they were lost in the distant clouds  he pencilled them on the clouds and bade them farewell with a sigh  he sat down on a large stone to take out a little pebble from his shoe when he saw at some distance a beggar approaching him  he had on a loose sort of coat mended with differentcoloured rags amongst which the blue and the russet were the predominant  he had a short knotty stick in his hand and on the top of it was stuck a rams horn his knees though he was no pilgrim had worn the stuff of his breeches he wore no shoes and his stockings had entirely lost that part of them which should have covered his feet and ankles in his face however was the plump appearance of good humour he walked a good round pace and a crooklegged dog trotted at his heels  our delicacies said harley to himself are fantastic they are not in nature that beggar walks over the sharpest of these stones barefooted whilst i have lost the most delightful dream in the world from the smallest of them happening to get into my shoe  the beggar had by this time come up and pulling off a piece of hat asked charity of harley the dog began to beg too—it was impossible to resist both and in truth the want of shoes and stockings had made both unnecessary for harley had destined sixpence for him before  the beggar on receiving it poured forth blessings without number and with a sort of smile on his countenance said to harley that if he wanted to have his fortune told—harley turned his eye briskly on the beggar it was an unpromising look for the subject of a prediction and silenced the prophet immediately  i would much rather learn said harley what it is in your power to tell me your trade must be an entertaining one sit down on this stone and let me know something of your profession i have often thought of turning fortuneteller for a week or two myself  master replied the beggar i like your frankness much god knows i had the humour of plaindealing in me from a child but there is no doing with it in this world we must live as we can and lying is as you call it my profession but i was in some sort forced to the trade for i dealt once in telling truth  i was a labourer sir and gained as much as to make me live i never laid by indeed for i was reckoned a piece of a wag and your wags i take it are seldom rich mr harley  so said harley you seem to know me  ay there are few folks in the country that i dont know something of how should i tell fortunes else  true but to go on with your story you were a labourer you say and a wag your industry i suppose you left with your old trade but your humour you preserve to be of use to you in your new  what signifies sadness sir a man grows lean ont but i was brought to my idleness by degrees first i could not work and it went against my stomach to work ever after  i was seized with a jail fever at the time of the assizes being in the county where i lived for i was always curious to get acquainted with the felons because they are commonly fellows of much mirth and little thought qualities i had ever an esteem for  in the height of this fever mr harley the house where i lay took fire and burnt to the ground i was carried out in that condition and lay all the rest of my illness in a barn  i got the better of my disease however but i was so weak that i spit blood whenever i attempted to work  i had no relation living that i knew of and i never kept a friend above a week when i was able to joke i seldom remained above six months in a parish so that i might have died before i had found a settlement in any thus i was forced to beg my bread and a sorry trade i found it mr harley  i told all my misfortunes truly but they were seldom believed and the few who gave me a halfpenny as they passed did it with a shake of the head and an injunction not to trouble them with a long story  in short i found that people dont care to give alms without some security for their money a wooden leg or a withered arm is a sort of draught upon heaven for those who choose to have their money placed to account there so i changed my plan and instead of telling my own misfortunes began to prophesy happiness to others  this i found by much the better way folks will always listen when the tale is their own and of many who say they do not believe in fortunetelling i have known few on whom it had not a very sensible effect  i pick up the names of their acquaintance amours and little squabbles are easily gleaned among servants and neighbours and indeed people themselves are the best intelligencers in the world for our purpose they dare not puzzle us for their own sakes for every one is anxious to hear what they wish to believe and they who repeat it to laugh at it when they have done are generally more serious than their hearers are apt to imagine  with a tolerable good memory and some share of cunning with the help of walking anights over heaths and churchyards with this and showing the tricks of that there dog whom i stole from the serjeant of a marching regiment and by the way he can steal too upon occasion i make shift to pick up a livelihood  my trade indeed is none of the honestest yet people are not much cheated neither who give a few halfpence for a prospect of happiness which i have heard some persons say is all a man can arrive at in this world  but i must bid you good day sir for i have three miles to walk before noon to inform some boardingschool young ladies whether their husbands are to be peers of the realm or captains in the army a question which i promised to answer them by that time  harley had drawn a shilling from his pocket but virtue bade him consider on whom he was going to bestow it  virtue held back his arm but a milder form a younger sister of virtues not so severe as virtue nor so serious as pity smiled upon him his fingers lost their compression nor did virtue offer to catch the money as it fell  it had no sooner reached the ground than the watchful cur a trick he had been taught snapped it up and contrary to the most approved method of stewardship delivered it immediately into the hands of his master     chapter xix he makes a second expedition to the baronets  the laudable ambition of a young man to be thought something by the world   we have related in a former chapter the little success of his first visit to the great man for whom he had the introductory letter from mr walton  to people of equal sensibility the influence of those trifles we mentioned on his deportment will not appear surprising but to his friends in the country they could not be stated nor would they have allowed them any place in the account  in some of their letters therefore which he received soon after they expressed their surprise at his not having been more urgent in his application and again recommended the blushless assiduity of successful merit  he resolved to make another attempt at the baronets fortified with higher notions of his own dignity and with less apprehension of repulse in his way to grosvenor square he began to ruminate on the folly of mankind who affixed those ideas of superiority to riches which reduced the minds of men by nature equal with the more fortunate to that sort of servility which he felt in his own  by the time he had reached the square and was walking along the pavement which led to the baronets he had brought his reasoning on the subject to such a point that the conclusion by every rule of logic should have led him to a thorough indifference in his approaches to a fellowmortal whether that fellowmortal was possessed of six or six thousand pounds a year  it is probable however that the premises had been improperly formed for it is certain that when he approached the great mans door he felt his heart agitated by an unusual pulsation  he had almost reached it when he observed among gentleman coming out dressed in a white frock and a red laced waistcoat with a small switch in his hand which he seemed to manage with a particular good grace  as he passed him on the steps the stranger very politely made him a bow which harley returned though he could not remember ever having seen him before  he asked harley in the same civil manner if he was going to wait on his friend the baronet  for i was just calling said he and am sorry to find that he is gone for some days into the country  harley thanked him for his information and was turning from the door when the other observed that it would be proper to leave his name and very obligingly knocked for that purpose  here is a gentleman tom who meant to have waited on your master  your name if you please sir  harley  youll remember tom harley  the door was shut  since we are here said he we shall not lose our walk if we add a little to it by a turn or two in hyde park  he accompanied this proposal with a second bow and harley accepted of it by another in return  the conversation as they walked was brilliant on the side of his companion  the playhouse the opera with every occurrence in high life he seemed perfectly master of and talked of some reigning beauties of quality in a manner the most feeling in the world  harley admired the happiness of his vivacity and opposite as it was to the reserve of his own nature began to be much pleased with its effects  though i am not of opinion with some wise men that the existence of objects depends on idea yet i am convinced that their appearance is not a little influenced by it  the optics of some minds are in so unlucky a perspective as to throw a certain shade on every picture that is presented to them while those of others of which number was harley like the mirrors of the ladies have a wonderful effect in bettering their complexions  through such a medium perhaps he was looking on his present companion  when they had finished their walk and were returning by the corner of the park they observed a board hung out of a window signifying an excellent ordinary on saturdays and sundays  it happened to be saturday and the table was covered for the purpose  what if we should go in and dine here if you happen not to be engaged sir said the young gentleman  it is not impossible but we shall meet with some original or other it is a sort of humour i like hugely  harley made no objection and the stranger showed him the way into the parlour  he was placed by the courtesy of his introductor in an armchair that stood at one side of the fire  over against him was seated a man of a grave considering aspect with that look of sober prudence which indicates what is commonly called a warm man  he wore a pretty large wig which had once been white but was now of a brownish yellow his coat was one of those modestcoloured drabs which mock the injuries of dust and dirt two jackboots concealed in part the wellmended knees of an old pair of buckskin breeches while the spotted handkerchief round his neck preserved at once its owner from catching cold and his neckcloth from being dirtied  next him sat another man with a tankard in his hand and a quid of tobacco in his cheek whose eye was rather more vivacious and whose dress was something smarter  the firstmentioned gentleman took notice that the room had been so lately washed as not to have had time to dry and remarked that wet lodging was unwholesome for man or beast  he looked round at the same time for a poker to stir the fire with which he at last observed to the company the people of the house had removed in order to save their coals  this difficulty however he overcame by the help of harleys stick saying that as they should no doubt pay for their fire in some shape or other he saw no reason why they should not have the use of it while they sat  the door was now opened for the admission of dinner  i dont know how it is with you gentlemen said harleys new acquaintance but i am afraid i shall not be able to get down a morsel at this horrid mechanical hour of dining  he sat down however and did not show any want of appetite by his eating  he took upon him the carving of the meat and criticised on the goodness of the pudding  when the tablecloth was removed he proposed calling for some punch which was readily agreed to he seemed at first inclined to make it himself but afterwards changed his mind and left that province to the waiter telling him to have it pure west indian or he could not taste a drop of it  when the punch was brought he undertook to fill the glasses and call the toasts  the king—the toast naturally produced politics  it is the privilege of englishmen to drink the kings health and to talk of his conduct  the man who sat opposite to harley and who by this time partly from himself and partly from his acquaintance on his left hand was discovered to be a grazier observed that it was a shame for so many pensioners to be allowed to take the bread out of the mouth of the poor  ay and provisions said his friend were never so dear in the memory of man i wish the king and his counsellors would look to that  as for the matter of provisions neighbour wrightson he replied i am sure the prices of cattle—  a dispute would have probably ensued but it was prevented by the spruce toastmaster who gave a sentiment and turning to the two politicians pray gentlemen said he let us have done with these musty politics i would always leave them to the beersuckers in butcher row  come let us have something of the fine arts  that was a damnd hard match between joe the nailor and tim bucket  the knowing ones were cursedly taken in there  i lost a cool hundred myself faith  at mention of the cool hundred the grazier threw his eyes aslant with a mingled look of doubt and surprise while the man at his elbow looked arch and gave a short emphatical sort of cough  both seemed to be silenced however by this intelligence and while the remainder of the punch lasted the conversation was wholly engrossed by the gentleman with the fine waistcoat who told a great many immense comical stories and confounded smart things as he termed them acted and spoken by lords ladies and young bucks of quality of his acquaintance  at last the grazier pulling out a watch of a very unusual size and telling the hour said that he had an appointment  is it so late said the young gentleman then i am afraid i have missed an appointment already but the truth is i am cursedly given to missing of appointments  when the grazier and he were gone harley turned to the remaining personage and asked him if he knew that young gentleman  a gentleman said he ay he is one of your gentlemen at the top of an affidavit  i knew him some years ago in the quality of a footman and i believe he had some times the honour to be a pimp  at last some of the great folks to whom he had been serviceable in both capacities had him made a gauger in which station he remains and has the assurance to pretend an acquaintance with men of quality  the impudent dog with a few shillings in his pocket he will talk you three times as much as my friend mundy there who is worth nine thousand if hes worth a farthing  but i know the rascal and despise him as he deserves  harley began to despise him too and to conceive some indignation at having sat with patience to hear such a fellow speak nonsense  but he corrected himself by reflecting that he was perhaps as well entertained and instructed too by this same modest gauger as he should have been by such a man as he had thought proper to personate  and surely the fault may more properly be imputed to that rank where the futility is real than where it is feigned to that rank whose opportunities for nobler accomplishments have only served to rear a fabric of folly which the untutored hand of affectation even among the meanest of mankind can imitate with success     chapter xx he visits bedlam—the distresses of a daughter   of those things called sights in london which every stranger is supposed desirous to see bedlam is one  to that place therefore an acquaintance of harleys after having accompanied him to several other shows proposed a visit  harley objected to it because said he i think it an inhuman practice to expose the greatest misery with which our nature is afflicted to every idle visitant who can afford a trifling perquisite to the keeper especially as it is a distress which the humane must see with the painful reflection that it is not in their power to alleviate it  he was overpowered however by the solicitations of his friend and the other persons of the party amongst whom were several ladies and they went in a body to moorfields  their conductor led them first to the dismal mansions of those who are in the most horrid state of incurable madness  the clanking of chains the wildness of their cries and the imprecations which some of them uttered formed a scene inexpressibly shocking  harley and his companions especially the female part of them begged their guide to return he seemed surprised at their uneasiness and was with difficulty prevailed on to leave that part of the house without showing them some others who as he expressed it in the phrase of those that keep wild beasts for show were much better worth seeing than any they had passed being ten times more fierce and unmanageable  he led them next to that quarter where those reside who as they are not dangerous to themselves or others enjoy a certain degree of freedom according to the state of their distemper  harley had fallen behind his companions looking at a man who was making pendulums with bits of thread and little balls of clay  he had delineated a segment of a circle on the wall with chalk and marked their different vibrations by intersecting it with cross lines  a decentlooking man came up and smiling at the maniac turned to harley and told him that gentleman had once been a very celebrated mathematician  he fell a sacrifice said he to the theory of comets for having with infinite labour formed a table on the conjectures of sir isaac newton he was disappointed in the return of one of those luminaries and was very soon after obliged to be placed here by his friends  if you please to follow me sir continued the stranger i believe i shall be able to give you a more satisfactory account of the unfortunate people you see here than the man who attends your companions  harley bowed and accepted his offer  the next person they came up to had scrawled a variety of figures on a piece of slate  harley had the curiosity to take a nearer view of them they consisted of different columns on the top of which were marked southsea annuities indiastock and three per cent annuities consol this said harleys instructor was a gentleman well known in change alley  he was once worth fifty thousand pounds and had actually agreed for the purchase of an estate in the west in order to realise his money but he quarrelled with the proprietor about the repairs of the garden wall and so returned to town to follow his old trade of stockjobbing a little longer when an unlucky fluctuation of stock in which he was engaged to an immense extent reduced him at once to poverty and to madness  poor wretch he told me tother day that against the next payment of differences he should be some hundreds above a plum  it is a spondee and i will maintain it interrupted a voice on his left hand  this assertion was followed by a very rapid recital of some verses from homer  that figure said the gentleman whose clothes are so bedaubed with snuff was a schoolmaster of some reputation he came hither to be resolved of some doubts he entertained concerning the genuine pronunciation of the greek vowels  in his highest fits he makes frequent mention of one mr bentley  but delusive ideas sir are the motives of the greatest part of mankind and a heated imagination the power by which their actions are incited the world in the eye of a philosopher may be said to be a large madhouse  it is true answered harley the passions of men are temporary madnesses and sometimes very fatal in their effects      from macedonias madman to the swede  it was indeed said the stranger a very mad thing in charles to think of adding so vast a country as russia to his dominions that would have been fatal indeed the balance of the north would then have been lost but the sultan and i would never have allowed it—sir said harley with no small surprise on his countenance—why yes answered the other the sultan and i do you know me  i am the chan of tartary  harley was a good deal struck by this discovery he had prudence enough however to conceal his amazement and bowing as low to the monarch as his dignity required left him immediately and joined his companions  he found them in a quarter of the house set apart for the insane of the other sex several of whom had gathered about the female visitors and were examining with rather more accuracy than might have been expected the particulars of their dress  separate from the rest stood one whose appearance had something of superior dignity  her face though pale and wasted was less squalid than those of the others and showed a dejection of that decent kind which moves our pity unmixed with horror upon her therefore the eyes of all were immediately turned  the keeper who accompanied them observed it this said he is a young lady who was born to ride in her coach and six  she was beloved if the story i have heard is true by a young gentleman her equal in birth though by no means her match in fortune but love they say is blind and so she fancied him as much as he did her  her father it seems would not hear of their marriage and threatened to turn her out of doors if ever she saw him again  upon this the young gentleman took a voyage to the west indies in hopes of bettering his fortune and obtaining his mistress but he was scarce landed when he was seized with one of the fevers which are common in those islands and died in a few days lamented by every one that knew him  this news soon reached his mistress who was at the same time pressed by her father to marry a rich miserly fellow who was old enough to be her grandfather  the death of her lover had no effect on her inhuman parent he was only the more earnest for her marriage with the man he had provided for her and what between her despair at the death of the one and her aversion to the other the poor young lady was reduced to the condition you see her in  but god would not prosper such cruelty her fathers affairs soon after went to wreck and he died almost a beggar  though this story was told in very plain language it had particularly attracted harleys notice he had given it the tribute of some tears the unfortunate young lady had till now seemed entranced in thought with her eyes fixed on a little garnet ring she wore on her finger she turned them now upon harley  my billy is no more said she do you weep for my billy  blessings on your tears  i would weep too but my brain is dry and it burns it burns it burns—she drew nearer to harley—be comforted young lady said he your billy is in heaven—is he indeed and shall we meet again and shall that frightful man pointing to the keeper not be there—alas  i am grown naughty of late i have almost forgotten to think of heaven yet i pray sometimes when i can i pray and sometimes i sing when i am saddest i sing—you shall hear me—hush      light be the earth on billys breast     and green the sod that wraps his grave  there was a plaintive wildness in the air not to be withstood and except the keepers there was not an unmoistened eye around her  do you weep again said she  i would not have you weep you are like my billy you are believe me just so he looked when he gave me this ring poor billy twas the last time ever we met—  twas when the seas were roaring—i love you for resembling my billy but i shall never love any man like him—she stretched out her hand to harley he pressed it between both of his and bathed it with his tears—nay that is billys ring said she you cannot have it indeed but here is another look here which i plated today of some goldthread from this bit of stuff will you keep it for my sake  i am a strange girl but my heart is harmless my poor heart it will burst some day feel how it beats  she pressed his hand to her bosom then holding her head in the attitude of listening—hark one two three be quiet thou little trembler my billy is cold—but i had forgotten the ring—she put it on his finger  farewell  i must leave you now—she would have withdrawn her hand harley held it to his lips—i dare not stay longer my head throbs sadly farewell—she walked with a hurried step to a little apartment at some distance  harley stood fixed in astonishment and pity his friend gave money to the keeper—harley looked on his ring—he put a couple of guineas into the mans hand be kind to that unfortunate—he burst into tears and left them     chapter xxi the misanthrope   the friend who had conducted him to moorfields called upon him again the next evening  after some talk on the adventures of the preceding day i carried you yesterday said he to harley to visit the mad let me introduce you tonight at supper to one of the wise but you must not look for anything of the socratic pleasantry about him on the contrary i warn you to expect the spirit of a diogenes  that you may be a little prepared for his extraordinary manner i will let you into some particulars of his history  he is the elder of the two sons of a gentleman of considerable estate in the country  their father died when they were young both were remarkable at school for quickness of parts and extent of genius this had been bred to no profession because his fathers fortune which descended to him was thought sufficient to set him above it the other was put apprentice to an eminent attorney  in this the expectations of his friends were more consulted than his own inclination for both his brother and he had feelings of that warm kind that could ill brook a study so dry as the law especially in that department of it which was allotted to him  but the difference of their tempers made the characteristical distinction between them  the younger from the gentleness of his nature bore with patience a situation entirely discordant to his genius and disposition  at times indeed his pride would suggest of how little importance those talents were which the partiality of his friends had often extolled they were now incumbrances in a walk of life where the dull and the ignorant passed him at every turn his fancy and his feeling were invincible obstacles to eminence in a situation where his fancy had no room for exertion and his feeling experienced perpetual disgust  but these murmurings he never suffered to be heard and that he might not offend the prudence of those who had been concerned in the choice of his profession he continued to labour in it several years till by the death of a relation he succeeded to an estate of a little better than £ 00 a year with which and the small patrimony left him he retired into the country and made a lovematch with a young lady of a similar temper to his own with whom the sagacious world pitied him for finding happiness  but his elder brother whom you are to see at supper if you will do us the favour of your company was naturally impetuous decisive and overbearing  he entered into life with those ardent expectations by which young men are commonly deluded in his friendships warm to excess and equally violent in his dislikes  he was on the brink of marriage with a young lady when one of those friends for whose honour he would have pawned his life made an elopement with that very goddess and left him besides deeply engaged for sums which that good friends extravagance had squandered  the dreams he had formerly enjoyed were now changed for ideas of a very different nature  he abjured all confidence in anything of human form sold his lands which still produced him a very large reversion came to town and immured himself with a woman who had been his nurse in little better than a garret and has ever since applied his talents to the vilifying of his species  in one thing i must take the liberty to instruct you however different your sentiments may be and different they must be you will suffer him to go on without contradiction otherwise he will be silent immediately and we shall not get a word from him all the night after  harley promised to remember this injunction and accepted the invitation of his friend  when they arrived at the house they were informed that the gentleman was come and had been shown into the parlour  they found him sitting with a daughter of his friends about three years old on his knee whom he was teaching the alphabet from a horn book at a little distance stood a sister of hers some years older  get you away miss said he to this last you are a pert gossip and i will have nothing to do with you—nay answered she nancy is your favourite you are quite in love with nancy—take away that girl said he to her father whom he now observed to have entered the room she has woman about her already the children were accordingly dismissed  betwixt that and suppertime he did not utter a syllable  when supper came he quarrelled with every dish at table but eat of them all only exempting from his censures a salad which you have not spoiled said he because you have not attempted to cook it  when the wine was set upon the table he took from his pocket a particular smoking apparatus and filled his pipe without taking any more notice of harley or his friend than if no such persons had been in the room  harley could not help stealing a look of surprise at him but his friend who knew his humour returned it by annihilating his presence in the like manner and leaving him to his own meditations addressed himself entirely to harley  in their discourse some mention happened to be made of an amiable character and the words honour and politeness were applied to it upon this the gentleman laying down his pipe and changing the tone of his countenance from an ironical grin to something more intently contemptuous honour said he honour and politeness this is the coin of the world and passes current with the fools of it  you have substituted the shadow honour instead of the substance virtue and have banished the reality of friendship for the fictitious semblance which you have termed politeness politeness which consists in a certain ceremonious jargon more ridiculous to the ear of reason than the voice of a puppet  you have invented sounds which you worship though they tyrannize over your peace and are surrounded with empty forms which take from the honest emotions of joy and add to the poignancy of misfortune  sir said harley—his friend winked to him to remind him of the caution he had received  he was silenced by the thought  the philosopher turned his eye upon him he examined him from top to toe with a sort of triumphant contempt harleys coat happened to be a new one the others was as shabby as could possibly be supposed to be on the back of a gentleman there was much significance in his look with regard to this coat it spoke of the sleekness of folly and the threadbareness of wisdom  truth continued he the most amiable as well as the most natural of virtues you are at pains to eradicate  your very nurseries are seminaries of falsehood and what is called fashion in manhood completes the system of avowed insincerity  mankind in the gross is a gaping monster that loves to be deceived and has seldom been disappointed nor is their vanity less fallacious to your philosophers who adopt modes of truth to follow them through the paths of error and defend paradoxes merely to be singular in defending them  these are they whom ye term ingenious tis a phrase of commendation i detest it implies an attempt to impose on my judgment by flattering my imagination yet these are they whose works are read by the old with delight which the young are taught to look upon as the codes of knowledge and philosophy  indeed the education of your youth is every way preposterous you waste at school years in improving talents without having ever spent an hour in discovering them one promiscuous line of instruction is followed without regard to genius capacity or probable situation in the commonwealth  from this beargarden of the pedagogue a raw unprincipled boy is turned loose upon the world to travel without any ideas but those of improving his dress at paris or starting into taste by gazing on some paintings at rome  ask him of the manners of the people and he will tell you that the skirt is worn much shorter in france and that everybody eats macaroni in italy  when he returns home he buys a seat in parliament and studies the constitution at arthurs  nor are your females trained to any more useful purpose they are taught by the very rewards which their nurses propose for good behaviour by the first thing like a jest which they hear from every male visitor of the family that a young woman is a creature to be married and when they are grown somewhat older are instructed that it is the purpose of marriage to have the enjoyment of pinmoney and the expectation of a jointure  these    indeed are the effects of luxury which is perhaps inseparable from a certain degree of power and grandeur in a nation  but it is not simply of the progress of luxury that we have to complain did its votaries keep in their own sphere of thoughtless dissipation we might despise them without emotion but the frivolous pursuits of pleasure are mingled with the most important concerns of the state and public enterprise shall sleep till he who should guide its operation has decided his bets at newmarket or fulfilled his engagement with a favourite mistress in the country  we want some man of acknowledged eminence to point our counsels with that firmness which the counsels of a great people require  we have hundreds of ministers who press forward into office without having ever learned that art which is necessary for every business the art of thinking and mistake the petulance which could give inspiration to smart sarcasms on an obnoxious measure in a popular assembly for the ability which is to balance the interest of kingdoms and investigate the latent sources of national superiority with the administration of such men the people can never be satisfied for besides that their confidence is gained only by the view of superior talents there needs that depth of knowledge which is not only acquainted with the just extent of power but can also trace its connection with the expedient to preserve its possessors from the contempt which attends irresolution or the resentment which follows temerity                                        here a considerable part is wanting    in short man is an animal equally selfish and vain  vanity indeed is but a modification of selfishness  from the latter there are some who pretend to be free they are generally such as declaim against the lust of wealth and power because they have never been able to attain any high degree in either they boast of generosity and feeling  they tell us perhaps they tell us in rhyme that the sensations of an honest heart of a mind universally benevolent make up the quiet bliss which they enjoy but they will not by this be exempted from the charge of selfishness  whence the luxurious happiness they describe in their little familycircles  whence the pleasure which they feel when they trim their evening fires and listen to the howl of winters wind whence but from the secret reflection of what houseless wretches feel from it  or do you administer comfort in affliction—the motive is at hand i have had it preached to me in nineteen out of twenty of your consolatory discourses—the comparative littleness of our own misfortunes  with vanity your best virtues are grossly tainted your benevolence which ye deduce immediately from the natural impulse of the heart squints to it for its reward  there are some indeed who tell us of the satisfaction which flows from a secret consciousness of good actions this secret satisfaction is truly excellent—when we have some friend to whom we may discover its excellence  he now paused a moment to relight his pipe when a clock that stood at his back struck eleven he started up at the sound took his hat and his cane and nodding good night with his head walked out of the room  the gentleman of the house called a servant to bring the strangers surtout what sort of a night is it fellow said he—it rains sir answered the servant with an easterly wind—easterly for ever  he made no other reply but shrugging up his shoulders till they almost touched his ears wrapped himself tight in his great coat and disappeared  this is a strange creature said his friend to harley  i cannot say answered he that his remarks are of the pleasant kind it is curious to observe how the nature of truth may be changed by the garb it wears softened to the admonition of friendship or soured into the severity of reproof yet this severity may be useful to some tempers it somewhat resembles a file disagreeable in its operation but hard metals may be the brighter for it                                           chapter xxv his skill in physiognomy   the company at the baronets removed to the playhouse accordingly and harley took his usual route into the park  he observed as he entered a freshlooking elderly gentleman in conversation with a beggar who leaning on his crutch was recounting the hardships he had undergone and explaining the wretchedness of his present condition  this was a very interesting dialogue to harley he was rude enough therefore to slacken his pace as he approached and at last to make a full stop at the gentlemans back who was just then expressing his compassion for the beggar and regretting that he had not a farthing of change about him at saying this he looked piteously on the fellow there was something in his physiognomy which caught harleys notice indeed physiognomy was one of harleys foibles for which he had been often rebuked by his aunt in the country who used to tell him that when he was come to her years and experience he would know that alls not gold that glitters and it must be owned that his aunt was a very sensible harshlooking maiden lady of threescore and upwards  but he was too apt to forget this caution and now it seems it had not occurred to him  stepping up therefore to the gentleman who was lamenting the want of silver your intentions sir said he are so good that i cannot help lending you my assistance to carry them into execution and gave the beggar a shilling  the other returned a suitable compliment and extolled the benevolence of harley they kept walking together and benevolence grew the topic of discourse  the stranger was fluent on the subject  there is no use of money said he equal to that of beneficence  with the profuse it is lost and even with those who lay it out according to the prudence of the world the objects acquired by it pall on the sense and have scarce become our own till they lose their value with the power of pleasing but here the enjoyment grows on reflection and our money is most truly ours when it ceases being in our possession  yet i agree in some measure answered harley with those who think that charity to our common beggars is often misplaced there are objects less obtrusive whose title is a better one  we cannot easily distinguish said the stranger and even of the worthless are there not many whose imprudence or whose vice may have been one dreadful consequence of misfortune  harley looked again in his face and blessed himself for his skill in physiognomy  by this time they had reached the end of the walk the old gentleman leaning on the rails to take breath and in the meantime they were joined by a younger man whose figure was much above the appearance of his dress which was poor and shabby  harleys former companion addressed him as an acquaintance and they turned on the walk together  the elder of the strangers complained of the closeness of the evening and asked the other if he would go with him into a house hard by and take one draught of excellent cyder  the man who keeps this house said he to harley was once a servant of mine  i could not think of turning loose upon the world a faithful old fellow for no other reason but that his age had incapacitated him so i gave him an annuity of ten pounds with the help of which he has set up this little place here and his daughter goes and sells milk in the city while her father manages his taproom as he calls it at home  i cant well ask a gentleman of your appearance to accompany me to so paltry a place  sir replied harley interrupting him i would much rather enter it than the most celebrated tavern in town  to give to the necessitous may sometimes be a weakness in the man to encourage industry is a duty in the citizen they entered the house accordingly  on a table at the corner of the room lay a pack of cards loosely thrown together  the old gentleman reproved the man of the house for encouraging so idle an amusement  harley attempted to defend him from the necessity of accommodating himself to the humour of his guests and taking up the cards began to shuffle them backwards and forwards in his hand  nay i dont think cards so unpardonable an amusement as some do replied the other and now and then about this time of the evening when my eyes begin to fail me for my book i divert myself with a game at piquet without finding my morals a bit relaxed by it  do you play piquet sir to harley  harley answered in the affirmative upon which the other proposed playing a pool at a shilling the game doubling the stakes adding that he never played higher with anybody  harleys good nature could not refuse the benevolent old man and the younger stranger though he at first pleaded prior engagements yet being earnestly solicited by his friend at last yielded to solicitation  when they began to play the old gentleman somewhat to the surprise of harley produced ten shillings to serve for markers of his score  he had no change for the beggar said harley to himself but i can easily account for it it is curious to observe the affection that inanimate things will create in us by a long acquaintance  if i may judge from my own feelings the old man would not part with one of these counters for ten times its intrinsic value it even got the better of his benevolence i myself have a pair of old brass sleeve buttons  here he was interrupted by being told that the old gentleman had beat the younger and that it was his turn to take up the conqueror  your game has been short said harley  i repiqued him answered the old man with joy sparkling in his countenance  harley wished to be repiqued too but he was disappointed for he had the same good fortune against his opponent indeed never did fortune mutable as she is delight in mutability so much as at that moment  the victory was so quick and so constantly alternate that the stake in a short time amounted to no less a sum than £   harleys proportion of which was within halfaguinea of the money he had in his pocket  he had before proposed a division but the old gentleman opposed it with such a pleasant warmth in his manner that it was always overruled  now however he told them that he had an appointment with some gentlemen and it was within a few minutes of his hour  the young stranger had gained one game and was engaged in the second with the other they agreed therefore that the stake should be divided if the old gentleman won that which was more than probable as his score was  0 to    and he was elder hand but a momentous repique decided it in favour of his adversary who seemed to enjoy his victory mingled with regret for having won too much while his friend with great ebullience of passion many praises of his own good play and many maledictions on the power of chance took up the cards and threw them into the fire     chapter xxvi fruits of the dead sea   the company he was engaged to meet were assembled in fleet street  he had walked some time along the strand amidst a crowd of those wretches who wait the uncertain wages of prostitution with ideas of pity suitable to the scene around him and the feelings he possessed and had got as far as somerset house when one of them laid hold of his arm and with a voice tremulous and faint asked him for a pint of wine in a manner more supplicatory than is usual with those whom the infamy of their profession has deprived of shame  he turned round at the demand and looked steadfastly on the person who made it  she was above the common size and elegantly formed her face was thin and hollow and showed the remains of tarnished beauty  her eyes were black but had little of their lustre left her cheeks had some paint laid on without art and productive of no advantage to her complexion which exhibited a deadly paleness on the other parts of her face  harley stood in the attitude of hesitation which she interpreting to her advantage repeated her request and endeavoured to force a leer of invitation into her countenance  he took her arm and they walked on to one of those obsequious taverns in the neighbourhood where the dearness of the wine is a discharge in full for the character of the house  from what impulse he did this we do not mean to enquire as it has ever been against our nature to search for motives where bad ones are to be found they entered and a waiter showed them a room and placed a bottle of claret on the table  harley filled the ladys glass which she had no sooner tasted than dropping it on the floor and eagerly catching his arm her eye grew fixed her lip assumed a clayey whiteness and she fell back lifeless in her chair  harley started from his seat and catching her in his arms supported her from falling to the ground looking wildly at the door as if he wanted to run for assistance but durst not leave the miserable creature it was not till some minutes after that it occurred to him to ring the bell which at last however he thought of and rung with repeated violence even after the waiter appeared  luckily the waiter had his senses somewhat more about him and snatching up a bottle of water which stood on a buffet at the end of the room he sprinkled it over the hands and face of the dying figure before him  she began to revive and with the assistance of some hartshorn drops which harley now for the first time drew from his pocket was able to desire the waiter to bring her a crust of bread of which she swallowed some mouthfuls with the appearance of the keenest hunger  the waiter withdrew when turning to harley sobbing at the same time and shedding tears i am sorry sir said she that i should have given you so much trouble but you will pity me when i tell you that till now i have not tasted a morsel these two days past—he fixed his eyes on hers—every circumstance but the last was forgotten and he took her hand with as much respect as if she had been a duchess  it was ever the privilege of misfortune to be revered by him—two days said he and i have fared sumptuously every day—he was reaching to the bell she understood his meaning and prevented him i beg sir said she that you would give yourself no more trouble about a wretch who does not wish to live but at present i could not eat a bit my stomach even rose at the last mouthful of that crust—he offered to call a chair saying that he hoped a little rest would relieve her—he had one halfguinea left  i am sorry he said that at present i should be able to make you an offer of no more than this paltry sum—she burst into tears your generosity sir is abused to bestow it on me is to take it from the virtuous  i have no title but misery to plead misery of my own procuring  no more of that answered harley there is virtue in these tears let the fruit of them be virtue—he rung and ordered a chair—though i am the vilest of beings said she i have not forgotten every virtue gratitude i hope i shall still have left did i but know who is my benefactor—my name is harley—could i ever have an opportunity—you shall and a glorious one too your future conduct—but i do not mean to reproach you—if i say—it will be the noblest reward—i will do myself the pleasure of seeing you again—here the waiter entered and told them the chair was at the door the lady informed harley of her lodgings and he promised to wait on her at ten next morning  he led her to the chair and returned to clear with the waiter without ever once reflecting that he had no money in his pocket  he was ashamed to make an excuse yet an excuse must be made he was beginning to frame one when the waiter cut him short by telling him that he could not run scores but that if he would leave his watch or any other pledge it would be as safe as if it lay in his pocket  harley jumped at the proposal and pulling out his watch delivered it into his hands immediately and having for once had the precaution to take a note of the lodging he intended to visit next morning sallied forth with a blush of triumph on his face without taking notice of the sneer of the waiter who twirling the watch in his hand made him a profound bow at the door and whispered to a girl who stood in the passage something in which the word cully was honoured with a particular emphasis     chapter xxvii his skill in physiognomy is doubted   after he had been some time with the company he had appointed to meet and the last bottle was called for he first recollected that he would be again at a loss how to discharge his share of the reckoning  he applied therefore to one of them with whom he was most intimate acknowledging that he had not a farthing of money about him and upon being jocularly asked the reason acquainted them with the two adventures we have just now related  one of the company asked him if the old man in hyde park did not wear a brownish coat with a narrow gold edging and his companion an old green frock with a buffcoloured waistcoat  upon harleys recollecting that they did then said he you may be thankful you have come off so well they are two as noted sharpers in their way as any in town and but tother night took me in for a much larger sum  i had some thoughts of applying to a justice but one does not like to be seen in those matters  harley answered that he could not but fancy the gentleman was mistaken as he never saw a face promise more honesty than that of the old man he had met with—his face said a gravelooking man when sat opposite to him squirting the juice of his tobacco obliquely into the grate  there was something very emphatical in the action for it was followed by a burst of laughter round the table  gentlemen said harley you are disposed to be merry it may be as you imagine for i confess myself ignorant of the town but there is one thing which makes me hear the loss of my money with temper the young fellow who won it must have been miserably poor i observed him borrow money for the stake from his friend he had distress and hunger in his countenance be his character what it may his necessities at least plead for him  at this there was a louder laugh than before  gentlemen said the lawyer one of whose conversations with harley we have already recorded heres a pretty fellow for you to have heard him talk some nights ago as i did you might have sworn he was a saint yet now he games with sharpers and loses his money and is bubbled by a fine tale of the dead sea and pawns his watch here are sanctified doings with a witness  young gentleman said his friend on the other side of the table let me advise you to be a little more cautious for the future and as for faces—you may look into them to know whether a mans nose be a long or a short one     chapter xxviii he keeps his appointment   the last nights raillery of his companions was recalled to his remembrance when he awoke and the colder homilies of prudence began to suggest some things which were nowise favourable for a performance of his promise to the unfortunate female he had met with before  he rose uncertain of his purpose but the torpor of such considerations was seldom prevalent over the warmth of his nature  he walked some turns backwards and forwards in his room he recalled the languid form of the fainting wretch to his mind he wept at the recollection of her tears though i am the vilest of beings i have not forgotten every virtue gratitude i hope i shall still have left—he took a larger stride—powers of mercy that surround me cried he do ye not smile upon deeds like these to calculate the chances of deception is too tedious a business for the life of man—the clock struck ten—when he was got downstairs he found that he had forgot the note of her lodgings he gnawed his lips at the delay he was fairly on the pavement when he recollected having left his purse he did but just prevent himself from articulating an imprecation  he rushed a second time up into his chamber  what a wretch i am said he ere this time perhaps—  twas a perhaps not to be borne—two vibrations of a pendulum would have served him to lock his bureau but they could not be spared  when he reached the house and inquired for miss atkins for that was the ladys name he was shown up three pair of stairs into a small room lighted by one narrow lattice and patched round with shreds of differentcoloured paper  in the darkest corner stood something like a bed before which a tattered coverlet hung by way of curtain  he had not waited long when she appeared  her face had the glister of newwashed tears on it  i am ashamed sir said she that you should have taken this fresh piece of trouble about one so little worthy of it but to the humane i know there is a pleasure in goodness for its own sake if you have patience for the recital of my story it may palliate though it cannot excuse my faults  harley bowed as a sign of assent and she began as follows—  i am the daughter of an officer whom a service of forty years had advanced no higher than the rank of captain  i have had hints from himself and been informed by others that it was in some measure owing to those principles of rigid honour which it was his boast to possess and which he early inculcated on me that he had been able to arrive at no better station  my mother died when i was a child old enough to grieve for her death but incapable of remembering her precepts  though my father was doatingly fond of her yet there were some sentiments in which they materially differed she had been bred from her infancy in the strictest principles of religion and took the morality of her conduct from the motives which an adherence to those principles suggested  my father who had been in the army from his youth affixed an idea of pusillanimity to that virtue which was formed by the doctrines excited by the rewards or guarded by the terrors of revelation his dashing idol was the honour of a soldier a term which he held in such reverence that he used it for his most sacred asseveration  when my mother died i was some time suffered to continue in those sentiments which her instructions had produced but soon after though from respect to her memory my father did not absolutely ridicule them yet he showed in his discourse to others so little regard to them and at times suggested to me motives of action so different that i was soon weaned from opinions which i began to consider as the dreams of superstition or the artful inventions of designing hypocrisy  my mothers books were left behind at the different quarters we removed to and my reading was principally confined to plays novels and those poetical descriptions of the beauty of virtue and honour which the circulating libraries easily afforded  as i was generally reckoned handsome and the quickness of my parts extolled by all our visitors my father had a pride in allowing me to the world  i was young giddy open to adulation and vain of those talents which acquired it  after the last war my father was reduced to halfpay with which we retired to a village in the country which the acquaintance of some genteel families who resided in it and the cheapness of living particularly recommended  my father rented a small house with a piece of ground sufficient to keep a horse for him and a cow for the benefit of his family  an old man servant managed his ground while a maid who had formerly been my mothers and had since been mine undertook the care of our little dairy they were assisted in each of their provinces by my father and me and we passed our time in a state of tranquillity which he had always talked of with delight and my train of reading had taught me to admire  though i had never seen the polite circles of the metropolis the company my father had introduced me into had given me a degree of good breeding which soon discovered a superiority over the young ladies of our village  i was quoted as an example of politeness and my company courted by most of the considerable families in the neighbourhood  amongst the houses where i was frequently invited was sir george winbrookes  he had two daughters nearly of my age with whom though they had been bred up in those maxims of vulgar doctrine which my superior understanding could not but despise yet as their good nature led them to an imitation of my manners in everything else i cultivated a particular friendship  some months after our first acquaintance sir georges eldest son came home from his travels  his figure his address and conversation were not unlike those warm ideas of an accomplished man which my favourite novels had taught me to form and his sentiments on the article of religion were as liberal as my own when any of these happened to be the topic of our discourse i who before had been silent from a fear of being single in opposition now kindled at the fire he raised and defended our mutual opinions with all the eloquence i was mistress of he would be respectfully attentive all the while and when i had ended would raise his eyes from the ground look at me with a gaze of admiration and express his applause in the highest strain of encomium this was an incense the more pleasing as i seldom or never had met with it before for the young gentlemen who visited sir george were for the most part of that athletic order the pleasure of whose lives is derived from foxhunting these are seldom solicitous to please the women at all or if they were would never think of applying their flattery to the mind  mr winbrooke observed the weakness of my soul and took every occasion of improving the esteem he had gained  he asked my opinion of every author of every sentiment with that submissive diffidence which showed an unlimited confidence in my understanding  i saw myself revered as a superior being by one whose judgment my vanity told me was not likely to err preferred by him to all the other visitors of my sex whose fortunes and rank should have entitled them to a much higher degree of notice i saw their little jealousies at the distinguished attention he paid me it was gratitude it was pride it was love  love which had made too fatal a progress in my heart before any declaration on his part should have warranted a return but i interpreted every look of attention every expression of compliment to the passion i imagined him inspired with and imputed to his sensibility that silence which was the effect of art and design  at length however he took an opportunity of declaring his love he now expressed himself in such ardent terms that prudence might have suspected their sincerity but prudence is rarely found in the situation i had been unguardedly led into besides that the course of reading to which i had been accustomed did not lead me to conclude that his expressions could be too warm to be sincere nor was i even alarmed at the manner in which he talked of marriage a subjection he often hinted to which genuine love should scorn to be confined  the woman he would often say who had merit like mine to fix his affection could easily command it for ever  that honour too which i revered was often called in to enforce his sentiments  i did not however absolutely assent to them but i found my regard for their opposites diminish by degrees  if it is dangerous to be convinced it is dangerous to listen for our reason is so much of a machine that it will not always be able to resist when the ear is perpetually assailed  in short mr harley for i tire you with a relation the catastrophe of which you will already have imagined i fell a prey to his artifices he had not been able so thoroughly to convert me that my conscience was silent on the subject but he was so assiduous to give repeated proofs of unabated affection that i hushed its suggestions as they rose  the world however i knew was not to be silenced and therefore i took occasion to express my uneasiness to my seducer and entreat him as he valued the peace of one to whom he professed such attachment to remove it by a marriage  he made excuse from his dependence on the will of his father but quieted my fears by the promise of endeavouring to win his assent  my father had been some days absent on a visit to a dying relation from whom he had considerable expectations  i was left at home with no other company than my books my books i found were not now such companions as they used to be i was restless melancholy unsatisfied with myself but judge my situation when i received a billet from mr winbrooke informing me that he had sounded sir george on the subject we had talked of and found him so averse to any match so unequal to his own rank and fortune that he was obliged with whatever reluctance to bid adieu to a place the remembrance of which should ever be dear to him  i read this letter a hundred times over  alone helpless conscious of guilt and abandoned by every better thought my mind was one motley scene of terror confusion and remorse  a thousand expedients suggested themselves and a thousand fears told me they would be vain at last in an agony of despair i packed up a few clothes took what money and trinkets were in the house and set out for london whither i understood he was gone pretending to my maid that i had received letters from my father requiring my immediate attendance  i had no other companion than a boy a servant to the man from whom i hired my horses  i arrived in london within an hour of mr winbrooke and accidentally alighted at the very inn where he was  he started and turned pale when he saw me but recovered himself in time enough to make many new protestations of regard and beg me to make myself easy under a disappointment which was equally afflicting to him he procured me lodgings where i slept or rather endeavoured to sleep for that night  next morning i saw him again he then mildly observed on the imprudence of my precipitate flight from the country and proposed my removing to lodgings at another end of the town to elude the search of my father till he should fall upon some method of excusing my conduct to him and reconciling him to my return  we took a hackneycoach and drove to the house he mentioned  it was situated in a dirty lane furnished with a tawdry affectation of finery with some old family pictures hanging on walls which their own cobwebs would better have suited  i was struck with a secret dread at entering nor was it lessened by the appearance of the landlady who had that look of selfish shrewdness which of all others is the most hateful to those whose feelings are untinctured with the world  a girl who she told us was her niece sat by her playing on a guitar while herself was at work with the assistance of spectacles and had a prayerbook with the leaves folded down in several places lying on the table before her  perhaps sir i tire you with my minuteness but the place and every circumstance about it is so impressed on my mind that i shall never forget it  i dined that day with mr winbrooke alone  he lost by degrees that restraint which i perceived too well to hang about him before and with his former gaiety and good humour repeated the flattering things which though they had once been fatal i durst not now distrust  at last taking my hand and kissing it it is thus said he that love will last while freedom is preserved thus let us ever be blessed without the galling thought that we are tied to a condition where we may cease to be so  i answered that the world thought otherwise that it had certain ideas of good fame which it was impossible not to wish to maintain  the world said he is a tyrant they are slaves who obey it let us be happy without the pale of the world  tomorrow i shall leave this quarter of it for one where the talkers of the world shall be foiled and lose us  could not my emily accompany me my friend my companion the mistress of my soul  nay do not look so emily  your father may grieve for a while but your father shall be taken care of this bankbill i intend as the comfort for his daughter  i could contain myself no longer wretch i exclaimed dost thou imagine that my fathers heart could brook dependence on the destroyer of his child and tamely accept of a base equivalent for her honour and his own  honour my emily said he is the word of fools or of those wiser men who cheat them  tis a fantastic bauble that does not suit the gravity of your fathers age but whatever it is i am afraid it can never be perfectly restored to you exchange the word then and let pleasure be your object now  at these words he clasped me in his arms and pressed his lips rudely to my bosom  i started from my seat  perfidious villain said i who darst insult the weakness thou hast undone were that father here thy coward soul would shrink from the vengeance of his honour  cursed be that wretch who has deprived him of it oh doubly cursed who has dragged on his hoary head the infamy which should have crushed her own  i snatched a knife which lay beside me and would have plunged it in my breast but the monster prevented my purpose and smiling with a grin of barbarous insult—  madam said he i confess you are rather too much in heroics for me i am sorry we should differ about trifles but as i seem somehow to have offended you i would willingly remedy it by taking my leave  you have been put to some foolish expense in this journey on my account allow me to reimburse you  so saying he laid a bankbill of what amount i had no patience to see upon the table  shame grief and indignation choked my utterance unable to speak my wrongs and unable to bear them in silence i fell in a swoon at his feet  what happened in the interval i cannot tell but when i came to myself i was in the arms of the landlady with her niece chafing my temples and doing all in her power for my recovery  she had much compassion in her countenance the old woman assumed the softest look she was capable of and both endeavoured to bring me comfort  they continued to show me many civilities and even the aunt began to be less disagreeable in my sight to the wretched to the forlorn as i was small offices of kindness are endearing  meantime my money was far spent nor did i attempt to conceal my wants from their knowledge  i had frequent thoughts of returning to my father but the dread of a life of scorn is insurmountable  i avoided therefore going abroad when i had a chance of being seen by any former acquaintance nor indeed did my health for a great while permit it and suffered the old woman at her own suggestion to call me niece at home where we now and then saw when they could prevail on me to leave my room one or two other elderly women and sometimes a grave businesslike man who showed great compassion for my indisposition and made me very obligingly an offer of a room at his countryhouse for the recovery of my health  this offer i did not chose to accept but told my landlady that i should be glad to be employed in any way of business which my skill in needlework could recommend me to confessing at the same time that i was afraid i should scarce be able to pay her what i already owed for board and lodging and that for her other good offices i had nothing but thanks to give her  my dear child said she do not talk of paying since i lost my own sweet girl here she wept your very picture she was miss emily i have nobody except my niece to whom i should leave any little thing i have been able to save you shall live with me my dear and i have sometimes a little millinery work in which when you are inclined to it you may assist us  by the way here are a pair of ruffles we have just finished for that gentleman you saw here at tea a distant relation of mine and a worthy man he is  twas pity you refused the offer of an apartment at his country house my niece you know was to have accompanied you and you might have fancied yourself at home a most sweet place it is and but a short mile beyond hampstead  who knows miss emily what effect such a visit might have had  if i had half your beauty i should not waste it pining after eer a worthless fellow of them all  i felt my heart swell at her words i would have been angry if i could but i was in that stupid state which is not easily awakened to anger when i would have chid her the reproof stuck in my throat i could only weep  her want of respect increased as i had not spirit to assert it  my work was now rather imposed than offered and i became a drudge for the bread i eat but my dependence and servility grew in proportion and i was now in a situation which could not make any extraordinary exertions to disengage itself from either—i found myself with child  at last the wretch who had thus trained me to destruction hinted the purpose for which those means had been used  i discovered her to be an artful procuress for the pleasures of those who are men of decency to the world in the midst of debauchery  i roused every spark of courage within me at the horrid proposal  she treated my passion at first somewhat mildly but when i continued to exert it she resented it with insult and told me plainly that if i did not soon comply with her desires i should pay her every farthing i owed or rot in a jail for life  i trembled at the thought still however i resisted her importunities and she put her threats in execution  i was conveyed to prison weak from my condition weaker from that struggle of grief and misery which for some time i had suffered  a miscarriage was the consequence  amidst all the horrors of such a state surrounded with wretches totally callous lost alike to humanity and to shame think mr harley think what i endured nor wonder that i at last yielded to the solicitations of that miscreant i had seen at her house and sunk to the prostitution which he tempted  but that was happiness compared to what i have suffered since  he soon abandoned me to the common use of the town and i was cast among those miserable beings in whose society i have since remained  oh did the daughters of virtue know our sufferings did they see our hearts torn with anguish amidst the affectation of gaiety which our faces are obliged to assume our bodies tortured by disease our minds with that consciousness which they cannot lose  did they know did they think of this mr harley  their censures are just but their pity perhaps might spare the wretches whom their justice should condemn  last night but for an exertion of benevolence which the infection of our infamy prevents even in the humane had i been thrust out from this miserable place which misfortune has yet left me exposed to the brutal insults of drunkenness or dragged by that justice which i could not bribe to the punishment which may correct but alas can never amend the abandoned objects of its terrors  from that mr harley your goodness has relieved me  he beckoned with his hand he would have stopped the mention of his favours but he could not speak had it been to beg a diadem  she saw his tears her fortitude began to fail at the sight when the voice of some stranger on the stairs awakened her attention  she listened for a moment then starting up exclaimed merciful god my fathers voice  she had scarce uttered the word when the door burst open and a man entered in the garb of an officer  when he discovered his daughter and harley he started back a few paces his look assumed a furious wildness he laid his hand on his sword  the two objects of his wrath did not utter a syllable  villain he cried thou seest a father who had once a daughters honour to preserve blasted as it now is behold him ready to avenge its loss  harley had by this time some power of utterance  sir said he if you will be a moment calm—  infamous coward interrupted the other dost thou preach calmness to wrongs like mine  he drew his sword  sir said harley let me tell you—the blood ran quicker to his cheek his pulse beat one no more and regained the temperament of humanity—you are deceived sir said he you are much deceived but i forgive suspicions which your misfortunes have justified i would not wrong you upon my soul i would not for the dearest gratification of a thousand worlds my heart bleeds for you  his daughter was now prostrate at his feet  strike said she strike here a wretch whose misery cannot end but with that death she deserves  her hair had fallen on her shoulders her look had the horrid calmness of outbreathed despair  her father would have spoken his lip quivered his cheek grew pale his eyes lost the lightning of their fury there was a reproach in them but with a mingling of pity  he turned them up to heaven then on his daughter  he laid his left hand on his heart the sword dropped from his right he burst into tears     chapter xxix the distresses of a father   harley kneeled also at the side of the unfortunate daughter  allow me sir said he to entreat your pardon for one whose offences have been already so signally punished  i know i feel that those tears wrung from the heart of a father are more dreadful to her than all the punishments your sword could have inflicted accept the contrition of a child whom heaven has restored to you  is she not lost answered he irrecoverably lost  damnation a common prostitute to the meanest ruffian  calmly my dear sir said harley did you know by what complicated misfortunes she had fallen to that miserable state in which you now behold her i should have no need of words to excite your compassion think sir of what once she was  would you abandon her to the insults of an unfeeling world deny her opportunity of penitence and cut off the little comfort that still remains for your afflictions and her own  speak said he addressing himself to his daughter speak i will hear thee  the desperation that supported her was lost she fell to the ground and bathed his feet with her tears  harley undertook her cause he related the treacheries to which she had fallen a sacrifice and again solicited the forgiveness of her father he looked on her for some time in silence the pride of a soldiers honour checked for a while the yearnings of his heart but nature at last prevailed he fell on her neck and mingled his tears with hers  harley who discovered from the dress of the stranger that he was just arrived from a journey begged that they would both remove to his lodgings till he could procure others for them  atkins looked at him with some marks of surprise  his daughter now first recovered the power of speech  wretch as i am said she yet there is some gratitude due to the preserver of your child  see him now before you  to him i owe my life or at least the comfort of imploring your forgiveness before i die  pardon me young gentleman said atkins i fear my passion wronged you  never never sir said harley if it had your reconciliation to your daughter were an atonement a thousand fold  he then repeated his request that he might be allowed to conduct them to his lodgings to which mr atkins at last consented  he took his daughters arm  come my emily said he we can never never recover that happiness we have lost but time may teach us to remember our misfortunes with patience  when they arrived at the house where harley lodged he was informed that the first floor was then vacant and that the gentleman and his daughter might be accommodated there  while he was upon his enquiry miss atkins informed her father more particularly what she owed to his benevolence when he turned into the room where they were atkins ran and embraced him—begged him again to forgive the offence he had given him and made the warmest protestations of gratitude for his favours  we would attempt to describe the joy which harley felt on this occasion did it not occur to us that one half of the world could not understand it though we did and the other half will by this time have understood it without any description at all  miss atkins now retired to her chamber to take some rest from the violence of the emotions she had suffered  when she was gone her father addressing himself to harley said you have a right sir to be informed of the present situation of one who owes so much to your compassion for his misfortunes  my daughter i find has informed you what that was at the fatal juncture when they began  her distresses you have heard you have pitied as they deserved with mine perhaps i cannot so easily make you acquainted  you have a feeling heart mr harley i bless it that it has saved my child but you never were a father a father torn by that most dreadful of calamities the dishonour of a child he doated on  you have been already informed of some of the circumstances of her elopement i was then from home called by the death of a relation who though he would never advance me a shilling on the utmost exigency in his lifetime left me all the gleanings of his frugality at his death  i would not write this intelligence to my daughter because i intended to be the bearer myself and as soon as my business would allow me i set out on my return winged with all the haste of paternal affection  i fondly built those schemes of future happiness which present prosperity is ever busy to suggest my emily was concerned in them all  as i approached our little dwelling my heart throbbed with the anticipation of joy and welcome  i imagined the cheering fire the blissful contentment of a frugal meal made luxurious by a daughters smile i painted to myself her surprise at the tidings of our newacquired riches our fond disputes about the disposal of them  the road was shortened by the dreams of happiness i enjoyed and it began to be dark as i reached the house i alighted from my horse and walked softly upstairs to the room we commonly sat in  i was somewhat disappointed at not finding my daughter there  i rung the bell her maid appeared and shewed no small signs of wonder at the summons  she blessed herself as she entered the room i smiled at her surprise where is miss emily sir said she  emily  yes sir she has been gone hence some days upon receipt of those letters you sent her  letters said i  yes sir so she told me and went off in all haste that very night  i stood aghast as she spoke but was able so far to recollect myself as to put on the affectation of calmness and telling her there was certainly some mistake in the affair desired her to leave me  when she was gone i threw myself into a chair in that state of uncertainty which is of all others the most dreadful  the gay visions with which i had delighted myself vanished in an instant  i was tortured with tracing back the same circle of doubt and disappointment my head grew dizzy as i thought  i called the servant again and asked her a hundred questions to no purpose there was not room even for conjecture  something at last arose in my mind which we call hope without knowing what it is  i wished myself deluded by it but it could not prevail over my returning fears  i rose and walked through the room  my emilys spinnet stood at the end of it open with a book of music folded down at some of my favourite lessons  i touched the keys there was a vibration in the sound that froze my blood i looked around and methought the family pictures on the walls gazed on me with compassion in their faces i sat down again with an attempt at more composure i started at every creaking of the door and my ears rung with imaginary noises  i had not remained long in this situation when the arrival of a friend who had accidentally heard of my return put an end to my doubts by the recital of my daughters dishonour  he told me he had his information from a young gentleman to whom winbrooke had boasted of having seduced her  i started from my seat with broken curses on my lips and without knowing whither i should pursue them ordered my servant to load my pistols and saddle my horses  my friend however with great difficulty persuaded me to compose myself for that night promising to accompany me on the morrow to sir george winbrookes in quest of his son  the morrow came after a night spent in a state little distant from madness  we went as early as decency would allow to sir georges  he received me with politeness and indeed compassion protested his abhorrence of his sons conduct and told me that he had set out some days before for london on which place he had procured a draft for a large sum on pretence of finishing his travels but that he had not heard from him since his departure  i did not wait for any more either of information or comfort but against the united remonstrances of sir george and my friend set out instantly for london with a frantic uncertainty of purpose but there all manner of search was in vain  i could trace neither of them any farther than the inn where they first put up on their arrival and after some days fruitless inquiry returned home destitute of every little hope that had hitherto supported me  the journeys i had made the restless nights i had spent above all the perturbation of my mind had the effect which naturally might be expected—a very dangerous fever was the consequence  from this however contrary to the expectation of my physicians i recovered  it was now that i first felt something like calmness of mind probably from being reduced to a state which could not produce the exertions of anguish or despair  a stupid melancholy settled on my soul i could endure to live with an apathy of life at times i forgot my resentment and wept at the remembrance of my child  such has been the tenor of my days since that fatal moment when these misfortunes began till yesterday that i received a letter from a friend in town acquainting me of her present situation  could such tales as mine mr harley be sometimes suggested to the daughters of levity did they but know with what anxiety the heart of a parent flutters round the child he loves they would be less apt to construe into harshness that delicate concern for their conduct which they often complain of as laying restraint upon things to the young the gay and the thoughtless seemingly harmless and indifferent  alas  i fondly imagined that i needed not even these common cautions my emily was the joy of my age and the pride of my soul  those things are now no more they are lost for ever  her death i could have born but the death of her honour has added obloquy and shame to that sorrow which bends my grey hairs to the dust  as he spoke these last words his voice trembled in his throat it was now lost in his tears  he sat with his face half turned from harley as if he would have hid the sorrow which he felt  harley was in the same attitude himself he durst not meet his eye with a tear but gathering his stifled breath let me entreat you sir said he to hope better things  the world is ever tyrannical it warps our sorrows to edge them with keener affliction  let us not be slaves to the names it affixes to motive or to action  i know an ingenuous mind cannot help feeling when they sting  but there are considerations by which it may be overcome its fantastic ideas vanish as they rise they teach us to look beyond it                                          a fragment showing his success with the baronet     the card he received was in the politest style in which disappointment could be communicated  the baronet was under a necessity of giving up his application for mr harley as he was informed that the lease was engaged for a gentleman who had long served his majesty in another capacity and whose merit had entitled him to the first lucrative thing that should be vacant  even harley could not murmur at such a disposal  perhaps said he to himself some warworn officer who like poor atkins had been neglected from reasons which merited the highest advancement whose honour could not stoop to solicit the preferment he deserved perhaps with a family taught the principles of delicacy without the means of supporting it a wife and children—gracious heaven whom my wishes would have deprived of bread—  he was interrupted in his reverie by some one tapping him on the shoulder and on turning round he discovered it to be the very man who had explained to him the condition of his gay companion at hyde park corner  i am glad to see you sir said he i believe we are fellows in disappointment  harley started and said that he was at a loss to understand him  pooh you need not be so shy answered the other every one for himself is but fair and i had much rather you had got it than the rascally gauger  harley still protested his ignorance of what he meant  why the lease of bancroft manor had not you been applying for it  i confess i was replied harley but i cannot conceive how you should be interested in the matter  why i was making interest for it myself said he and i think i had some title  i voted for this same baronet at the last election and made some of my friends do so too though i would not have you imagine that i sold my vote  no i scorn it let me tell you i scorn it but i thought as how this man was staunch and true and i find hes but a doublefaced fellow after all and speechifies in the house for any side he hopes to make most by  oh how many fine speeches and squeezings by the hand we had of him on the canvas  and if ever i shall be so happy as to have an opportunity of serving you  a murrain on the smoothtongued knave and after all to get it for this pimp of a gauger  the gauger there must be some mistake said harley  he writes me that it was engaged for one whose long services—  services interrupted the other you shall hear services  yes his sister arrived in town a few days ago and is now sempstress to the baronet  a plague on all rogues says honest sam wrightson  i shall but just drink damnation to them tonight in a crowns worth of ashleys and leave london tomorrow by sunrise  i shall leave it too said harley and so he accordingly did  in passing through piccadilly he had observed on the window of an inn a notification of the departure of a stagecoach for a place in his road homewards in the way back to his lodgings he took a seat in it for his return     chapter xxxiii he leaves london—characters in a stagecoach   the company in the stagecoach consisted of a grocer and his wife who were going to pay a visit to some of their country friends a young officer who took this way of marching to quarters a middleaged gentlewoman who had been hired as housekeeper to some family in the country and an elderly welllooking man with a remarkable oldfashioned periwig  harley upon entering discovered but one vacant seat next the grocers wife which from his natural shyness of temper he made no scruple to occupy however aware that riding backwards always disagreed with him  though his inclination to physiognomy had met with some rubs in the metropolis he had not yet lost his attachment to that science  he set himself therefore to examine as usual the countenances of his companions  here indeed he was not long in doubt as to the preference for besides that the elderly gentleman who sat opposite to him had features by nature more expressive of good dispositions there was something in that periwig we mentioned peculiarly attractive of harleys regard  he had not been long employed in these speculations when he found himself attacked with that faintish sickness which was the natural consequence of his situation in the coach  the paleness of his countenance was first observed by the housekeeper who immediately made offer of her smelling bottle which harley however declined telling at the same time the cause of his uneasiness  the gentleman on the opposite side of the coach now first turned his eye from the side direction in which it had been fixed and begged harley to exchange places with him expressing his regret that he had not made the proposal before  harley thanked him and upon being assured that both seats were alike to him was about to accept of his offer when the young gentleman of the sword putting on an arch look laid hold of the others arm so my old boy said he i find you have still some youthful blood about you but with your leave i will do myself the honour of sitting by this lady and took his place accordingly  the grocer stared him as full in the face as his own short neck would allow and his wife who was a little roundfaced woman with a great deal of colour in her cheeks drew up at the compliment that was paid her looking first at the officer and then at the housekeeper  this incident was productive of some discourse for before though there was sometimes a cough or a hem from the grocer and the officer now and then hummd a few notes of a song there had not a single word passed the lips of any of the company  mrs grocer observed how illconvenient it was for people who could not be drove backwards to travel in a stage  this brought on a dissertation on stagecoaches in general and the pleasure of keeping a chay of ones own which led to another on the great riches of mr deputy bearskin who according to her had once been of that industrious order of youths who sweep the crossings of the streets for the conveniency of passengers but by various fortunate accidents had now acquired an immense fortune and kept his coach and a dozen livery servants  all this afforded ample fund for conversation if conversation it might be called that was carried on solely by the beforementioned lady nobody offering to interrupt her except that the officer sometimes signified his approbation by a variety of oaths a sort of phraseology in which he seemed extremely versant  she appealed indeed frequently to her husband for the authenticity of certain facts of which the good man as often protested his total ignorance but as he was always called fool or something very like it for his pains he at last contrived to support the credit of his wife without prejudice to his conscience and signified his assent by a noise not unlike the grunting of that animal which in shape and fatness he somewhat resembled  the housekeeper and the old gentleman who sat next to harley were now observed to be fast asleep at which the lady who had been at such pains to entertain them muttered some words of displeasure and upon the officers whispering to smoke the old put both she and her husband pursd up their mouths into a contemptuous smile  harley looked sternly on the grocer  you are come sir said he to those years when you might have learned some reverence for age  as for this young man who has so lately escaped from the nursery he may be allowed to divert himself  damme sir said the officer do you call me young striking up the front of his hat and stretching forward on his seat till his face almost touched harleys  it is probable however that he discovered something there which tended to pacify him for on the ladies entreating them not to quarrel he very soon resumed his posture and calmness together and was rather less profuse of his oaths during the rest of the journey  it is possible the old gentleman had waked time enough to hear the last part of this discourse at least whether from that cause or that he too was a physiognomist he wore a look remarkably complacent to harley who on his part shewed a particular observance of him  indeed they had soon a better opportunity of making their acquaintance as the coach arrived that night at the town where the officers regiment lay and the places of destination of their other fellowtravellers it seems were at no great distance for next morning the old gentleman and harley were the only passengers remaining  when they left the inn in the morning harley pulling out a little pocketbook began to examine the contents and make some corrections with a pencil  this said he turning to his companion is an amusement with which i sometimes pass idle hours at an inn  these are quotations from those humble poets who trust their fame to the brittle tenure of windows and drinkingglasses  from our inn returned the gentleman a stranger might imagine that we were a nation of poets machines at least containing poetry which the motion of a journey emptied of their contents  is it from the vanity of being thought geniuses or a mere mechanical imitation of the custom of others that we are tempted to scrawl rhyme upon such places  whether vanity is the cause of our becoming rhymesters or not answered harley it is a pretty certain effect of it  an old man of my acquaintance who deals in apothegms used to say that he had known few men without envy few wits without illnature and no poet without vanity and i believe his remark is a pretty just one  vanity has been immemorially the charter of poets  in this the ancients were more honest than we are  the old poets frequently make boastful predictions of the immortality their works shall acquire them ours in their dedications and prefatory discourses employ much eloquence to praise their patrons and much seeming modesty to condemn themselves or at least to apologise for their productions to the world  but this in my opinion is the more assuming manner of the two for of all the garbs i ever saw pride put on that of her humility is to me the most disgusting  it is natural enough for a poet to be vain said the stranger  the little worlds which he raises the inspiration which he claims may easily be productive of selfimportance though that inspiration is fabulous it brings on egotism which is always the parent of vanity  it may be supposed answered harley that inspiration of old was an article of religious faith in modern times it may be translated a propensity to compose and i believe it is not always most readily found where the poets have fixed its residence amidst groves and plains and the scenes of pastoral retirement  the mind may be there unbent from the cares of the world but it will frequently at the same time be unnerved from any great exertion  it will feel imperfect and wander without effort over the regions of reflection  there is at least said the stranger one advantage in the poetical inclination that it is an incentive to philanthropy  there is a certain poetic ground on which a man cannot tread without feelings that enlarge the heart the causes of human depravity vanish before the romantic enthusiasm he professes and many who are not able to reach the parnassian heights may yet approach so near as to be bettered by the air of the climate  i have always thought so replied harley but this is an argument with the prudent against it they urge the danger of unfitness for the world  i allow it returned the other but i believe it is not always rightfully imputed to the bent for poetry that is only one effect of the common cause—jack says his father is indeed no scholar nor could all the drubbings from his master ever bring him one step forward in his accidence or syntax but i intend him for a merchant—allow the same indulgence to tom—tom reads virgil and horace when he should be casting accounts and but tother day he pawned his greatcoat for an edition of shakespeare—but tom would have been as he is though virgil and horace had never been born though shakespeare had died a linkboy for his nurse will tell you that when he was a child he broke his rattle to discover what it was that sounded within it and burnt the sticks of his gocart because he liked to see the sparkling of timber in the fire—tis a sad case but what is to be done—why jack shall make a fortune dine on venison and drink claret—ay but tom—tom shall dine with his brother when his pride will let him at other times he shall bless god over a halfpint of ale and a welshrabbit and both shall go to heaven as they may—thats a poor prospect for tom says the father—to go to heaven  i cannot agree with him  perhaps said harley we nowadays discourage the romantic turn a little too much  our boys are prudent too soon  mistake me not i do not mean to blame them for want of levity or dissipation but their pleasures are those of hackneyed vice blunted to every finer emotion by the repetition of debauch and their desire of pleasure is warped to the desire of wealth as the means of procuring it  the immense riches acquired by individuals have erected a standard of ambition destructive of private morals and of public virtue  the weaknesses of vice are left us but the most allowable of our failings we are taught to despise love the passion most natural to the sensibility of youth has lost the plaintive dignity he once possessed for the unmeaning simper of a dangling coxcomb and the only serious concern that of a dowry is settled even amongst the beardless leaders of the dancingschool  the frivolous and the interested might a satirist say are the characteristical features of the age they are visible even in the essays of our philosophers  they laugh at the pedantry of our fathers who complained of the times in which they lived they are at pains to persuade us how much those were deceived they pride themselves in defending things as they find them and in exploding the barren sounds which had been reared into motives for action  to this their style is suited and the manly tone of reason is exchanged for perpetual efforts at sneer and ridicule  this i hold to be an alarming crisis in the corruption of a state when not only is virtue declined and vice prevailing but when the praises of virtue are forgotten and the infamy of vice unfelt  they soon after arrived at the next inn upon the route of the stagecoach when the stranger told harley that his brothers house to which he was returning lay at no great distance and he must therefore unwillingly bid him adieu  i should like said harley taking his hand to have some word to remember so much seeming worth by my name is harley  i shall remember it answered the old gentleman in my prayers mine is silton  and silton indeed it was  ben silton himself  once more my honoured friend farewell—born to be happy without the world to that peaceful happiness which the world has not to bestow  envy never scowled on thy life nor hatred smiled on thy grave     chapter xxxiv he meets an old acquaintance   when the stagecoach arrived at the place of its destination harley began to consider how he should proceed the remaining part of his journey  he was very civilly accosted by the master of the inn who offered to accommodate him either with a postchaise or horses to any distance he had a mind but as he did things frequently in a way different from what other people call natural he refused these offers and set out immediately afoot having first put a spare shirt in his pocket and given directions for the forwarding of his portmanteau  this was a method of travelling which he was accustomed to take it saved the trouble of provision for any animal but himself and left him at liberty to chose his quarters either at an inn or at the first cottage in which he saw a face he liked nay when he was not peculiarly attracted by the reasonable creation he would sometimes consort with a species of inferior rank and lay himself down to sleep by the side of a rock or on the banks of a rivulet  he did few things without a motive but his motives were rather eccentric and the useful and expedient were terms which he held to be very indefinite and which therefore he did not always apply to the sense in which they are commonly understood  the sun was now in his decline and the evening remarkably serene when he entered a hollow part of the road which winded between the surrounding banks and seamed the sward in different lines as the choice of travellers had directed them to tread it  it seemed to be little frequented now for some of those had partly recovered their former verdure  the scene was such as induced harley to stand and enjoy it when turning round his notice was attracted by an object which the fixture of his eye on the spot he walked had before prevented him from observing  an old man who from his dress seemed to have been a soldier lay fast asleep on the ground a knapsack rested on a stone at his right hand while his staff and brasshilted sword were crossed at his left  harley looked on him with the most earnest attention  he was one of those figures which salvator would have drawn nor was the surrounding scenery unlike the wildness of that painters backgrounds  the banks on each side were covered with fantastic shrubwood and at a little distance on the top of one of them stood a fingerpost to mark the directions of two roads which diverged from the point where it was placed  a rock with some dangling wild flowers jutted out above where the soldier lay on which grew the stump of a large tree white with age and a single twisted branch shaded his face as he slept  his face had the marks of manly comeliness impaired by time his forehead was not altogether bald but its hairs might have been numbered while a few white locks behind crossed the brown of his neck with a contrast the most venerable to a mind like harleys  thou art old said he to himself but age has not brought thee rest for its infirmities i fear those silver hairs have not found shelter from thy country though that neck has been bronzed in its service  the stranger waked  he looked at harley with the appearance of some confusion it was a pain the latter knew too well to think of causing in another he turned and went on  the old man readjusted his knapsack and followed in one of the tracks on the opposite side of the road  when harley heard the tread of his feet behind him he could not help stealing back a glance at his fellowtraveller  he seemed to bend under the weight of his knapsack he halted on his walk and one of his arms was supported by a sling and lay motionless across his breast  he had that steady look of sorrow which indicates that its owner has gazed upon his griefs till he has forgotten to lament them yet not without those streaks of complacency which a good mind will sometimes throw into the countenance through all the incumbent load of its depression  he had now advanced nearer to harley and with an uncertain sort of voice begged to know what it was oclock i fear said he sleep has beguiled me of my time and i shall hardly have light enough left to carry me to the end of my journey  father said harley who by this time found the romantic enthusiasm rising within him how far do you mean to go  but a little way sir returned the other and indeed it is but a little way i can manage now tis just four miles from the height to the village thither i am going  i am going there too said harley we may make the road shorter to each other  you seem to have served your country sir to have served it hardly too tis a character i have the highest esteem for—i would not be impertinently inquisitive but there is that in your appearance which excites my curiosity to know something more of you in the meantime suffer me to carry that knapsack  the old man gazed on him a tear stood in his eye  young gentleman said he you are too good may heaven bless you for an old mans sake who has nothing but his blessing to give but my knapsack is so familiar to my shoulders that i should walk the worse for wanting it and it would be troublesome to you who have not been used to its weight  far from it answered harley i should tread the lighter it would be the most honourable badge i ever wore  sir said the stranger who had looked earnestly in harleys face during the last part of his discourse is act your name harley  it is replied he i am ashamed to say i have forgotten yours  you may well have forgotten my face said the stranger—tis a long time since you saw it but possibly you may remember something of old edwards  edwards cried harley oh heavens and sprung to embrace him let me clasp those knees on which i have sat so often edwards—i shall never forget that fireside round which i have been so happy  but where where have you been where is jack where is your daughter  how has it fared with them when fortune i fear has been so unkind to you  tis a long tale replied edwards but i will try to tell it you as we walk  when you were at school in the neighbourhood you remember me at southhill that farm had been possessed by my father grandfather and greatgrandfather which last was a younger brother of that very mans ancestor who is now lord of the manor  i thought i managed it as they had done with prudence i paid my rent regularly as it became due and had always as much behind as gave bread to me and my children  but my last lease was out soon after you left that part of the country and the squire who had lately got a londonattorney for his steward would not renew it because he said he did not chuse to have any farm under £ 00 a year value on his estate but offered to give me the preference on the same terms with another if i chose to take the one he had marked out of which mine was a part  what could i do mr harley  i feared the undertaking was too great for me yet to leave at my age the house i had lived in from my cradle  i could not mr harley i could not there was not a tree about it that i did not look on as my father my brother or my child so i even ran the risk and took the squires offer of the whole  but had soon reason to repent of my bargain the steward had taken care that my former farm should be the best land of the division i was obliged to hire more servants and i could not have my eye over them all some unfavourable seasons followed one another and i found my affairs entangling on my hands  to add to my distress a considerable cornfactor turned bankrupt with a sum of mine in his possession i failed paying my rent so punctually as i was wont to do and the same steward had my stock taken in execution in a few days after  so mr harley there was an end of my prosperity  however there was as much produced from the sale of my effects as paid my debts and saved me from a jail i thank god i wronged no man and the world could never charge me with dishonesty  had you seen us mr harley when we were turned out of southhill i am sure you would have wept at the sight  you remember old trusty my shag housedog i shall never forget it while i live the poor creature was blind with age and could scarce crawl after us to the door he went however as far as the gooseberrybush that you may remember stood on the left side of the yard he was wont to bask in the sun there when he had reached that spot he stopped we went on i called to him he wagged his tail but did not stir i called again he lay down i whistled and cried trusty he gave a short howl and died  i could have lain down and died too but god gave me strength to live for my children  the old man now paused a moment to take breath  he eyed harleys face it was bathed with tears the story was grown familiar to himself he dropped one tear and no more  though i was poor continued he i was not altogether without credit a gentleman in the neighbourhood who had a small farm unoccupied at the time offered to let me have it on giving security for the rent which i made shift to procure  it was a piece of ground which required management to make anything of but it was nearly within the compass of my sons labour and my own  we exerted all our industry to bring it into some heart  we began to succeed tolerably and lived contented on its produce when an unlucky accident brought us under the displeasure of a neighbouring justice of the peace and broke all our familyhappiness again  my son was a remarkable good shooter hehad always kept a pointer on our former farm and thought no harm in doing so now when one day having sprung a covey in our own ground the dog of his own accord followed them into the justices  my son laid down his gun and went after his dog to bring him back the gamekeeper who had marked the birds came up and seeing the pointer shot him just as my son approached  the creature fell my son ran up to him he died with a complaining sort of cry at his masters feet  jack could bear it no longer but flying at the gamekeeper wrenched his gun out of his hand and with the butt end of it felled him to the ground  he had scarce got home when a constable came with a warrant and dragged him to prison there he lay for the justices would not take bail till he was tried at the quartersessions for the assault and battery  his fine was hard upon us to pay we contrived however to live the worse for it and make up the loss by our frugality but the justice was not content with that punishment and soon after had an opportunity of punishing us indeed  an officer with pressorders came down to our county and having met with the justices agreed that they should pitch on a certain number who could most easily be spared from the county of whom he would take care to clear it my sons name was in the justices list  twas on a christmas eve and the birthday too of my sons little boy the night was piercing cold and it blew a storm with showers of hail and snow  we had made up a cheering fire in an inner room i sat before it in my wickerchair blessing providence that had still left a shelter for me and my children  my sons two little ones were holding their gambols around us my heart warmed at the sight i brought a bottle of my best ale and all our misfortunes were forgotten  it had long been our custom to play a game at blind mans buff on that night and it was not omitted now so to it we fell i and my son and his wife the daughter of a neighbouring farmer who happened to be with us at the time the two children and an old maid servant who had lived with me from a child  the lot fell on my son to be blindfolded we had continued some time in our game when he groped his way into an outer room in pursuit of some of us who he imagined had taken shelter there we kept snug in our places and enjoyed his mistake  he had not been long there when he was suddenly seized from behind i shall have you now said he and turned about  shall you so master answered the ruffian who had laid hold of him we shall make you play at another sort of game by and by—at these words harley started with a convulsive sort of motion and grasping edwardss sword drew it half out of the scabbard with a look of the most frantic wildness  edwards gently replaced it in its sheath and went on with his relation  on hearing these words in a strange voice we all rushed out to discover the cause the room by this time was almost full of the gang  my daughterinlaw fainted at the sight the maid and i ran to assist her while my poor son remained motionless gazing by turns on his children and their mother  we soon recovered her to life and begged her to retire and wait the issue of the affair but she flew to her husband and clung round him in an agony of terror and grief  in the gang was one of a smoother aspect whom by his dress we discovered to be a serjeant of foot he came up to me and told me that my son had his choice of the sea or land service whispering at the same time that if he chose the land he might get off on procuring him another man and paying a certain sum for his freedom  the money we could just muster up in the house by the assistance of the maid who produced in a green bag all the little savings of her service but the man we could not expect to find  my daughterinlaw gazed upon her children with a look of the wildest despair my poor infants said she your father is forced from you who shall now labour for your bread or must your mother beg for herself and you  i prayed her to be patient but comfort i had none to give her  at last calling the serjeant aside i asked him if i was too old to be accepted in place of my son  why i dont know said he you are rather old to be sure but yet the money may do much  i put the money in his hand and coming back to my children jack said i you are free live to give your wife and these little ones bread i will go my child in your stead i have but little life to lose and if i staid i should add one to the wretches you left behind  no replied my son i am not that coward you imagine me heaven forbid that my fathers grey hairs should be so exposed while i sat idle at home i am young and able to endure much and god will take care of you and my family  jack said i i will put an end to this matter you have never hitherto disobeyed me i will not be contradicted in this stay at home i charge you and for my sake be kind to my children  our parting mr harley i cannot describe to you it was the first time we ever had parted the very pressgang could scarce keep from tears but the serjeant who had seemed the softest before was now the least moved of them all  he conducted me to a party of newraised recruits who lay at a village in the neighbourhood and we soon after joined the regiment i had not been long with it when we were ordered to the east indies where i was soon made a serjeant and might have picked up some money if my heart had been as hard as some others were but my nature was never of that kind that could think of getting rich at the expense of my conscience  amongst our prisoners was an old indian whom some of our officers supposed to have a treasure hidden somewhere which is no uncommon practice in that country  they pressed him to discover it  he declared he had none but that would not satisfy them so they ordered him to be tied to a stake and suffer fifty lashes every morning till he should learn to speak out as they said  oh mr harley had you seen him as i did with his hands bound behind him suffering in silence while the big drops trickled down his shrivelled cheeks and wet his grey beard which some of the inhuman soldiers plucked in scorn  i could not bear it i could not for my soul and one morning when the rest of the guard were out of the way i found means to let him escape  i was tried by a courtmartial for negligence of my post and ordered in compassion of my age and having got this wound in my arm and that in my leg in the service only to suffer three hundred lashes and be turned out of the regiment but my sentence was mitigated as to the lashes and i had only two hundred  when i had suffered these i was turned out of the camp and had betwixt three and four hundred miles to travel before i could reach a seaport without guide to conduct me or money to buy me provisions by the way  i set out however resolved to walk as far as i could and then to lay myself down and die  but i had scarce gone a mile when i was met by the indian whom i had delivered  he pressed me in his arms and kissed the marks of the lashes on my back a thousand times he led me to a little hut where some friend of his dwelt and after i was recovered of my wounds conducted me so far on my journey himself and sent another indian to guide me through the rest  when we parted he pulled out a purse with two hundred pieces of gold in it  take this said he my dear preserver it is all i have been able to procure  i begged him not to bring himself to poverty for my sake who should probably have no need of it long but he insisted on my accepting it  he embraced me  you are an englishman said he but the great spirit has given you an indian heart may he bear up the weight of your old age and blunt the arrow that brings it rest  we parted and not long after i made shift to get my passage to england tis but about a week since i landed and i am going to end my days in the arms of my son  this sum may be of use to him and his children tis all the value i put upon it  i thank heaven i never was covetous of wealth i never had much but was always so happy as to be content with my little  when edwards had ended his relation harley stood a while looking at him in silence at last he pressed him in his arms and when he had given vent to the fulness of his heart by a shower of tears edwards said he let me hold thee to my bosom let me imprint the virtue of thy sufferings on my soul  come my honoured veteran let me endeavour to soften the last days of a life worn out in the service of humanity call me also thy son and let me cherish thee as a father  edwards from whom the recollection of his own suffering had scarced forced a tear now blubbered like a boy he could not speak his gratitude but by some short exclamations of blessings upon harley     chapter xxxv he misses an old acquaintance—an adventure consequent upon it   when they had arrived within a little way of the village they journeyed to harley stopped short and looked steadfastly on the mouldering walls of a ruined house that stood on the road side  oh heavens he cried what do i see silent unroofed and desolate  are all thy gay tenants gone do i hear their hum no more edwards look there look there the scene of my infant joys my earliest friendships laid waste and ruinous that was the very school where i was boarded when you were at southhill tis but a twelvemonth since i saw it standing and its benches filled with cherubs that opposite side of the road was the green on which they sported see it now ploughed up  i would have given fifty times its value to have saved it from the sacrilege of that plough  dear sir replied edwards perhaps they have left it from choice and may have got another spot as good  they cannot said harley they cannot i shall never see the sward covered with its daisies nor pressed by the dance of the dear innocents i shall never see that stump decked with the garlands which their little hands had gathered  these two long stones which now lie at the foot of it were once the supports of a hut i myself assisted to rear i have sat on the sods within it when we had spread our banquet of apples before us and been more blessed—oh  edwards infinitely more blessed than ever i shall be again  just then a woman passed them on the road and discovered some signs of wonder at the attitude of harley who stood with his hands folded together looking with a moistened eye on the fallen pillars of the hut he was too much entranced in thought to observe her at all but edwards civilly accosting her desired to know if that had not been the schoolhouse and how it came into the condition in which they now saw it  alack a day said she it was the schoolhouse indeed but to be sure sir the squire has pulled it down because it stood in the way of his prospects  what how prospects pulled down cried harley  yes to be sure sir and the green where the children used to play he has ploughed up because he said they hurt his fence on the other side of it  curses on his narrow heart cried harley that could violate a right so sacred  heaven blast the wretch      and from his derogate body never spring     a babe to honour him—  but i need not edwards i need not recovering himself a little he is cursed enough already to him the noblest source of happiness is denied and the cares of his sordid soul shall gnaw it while thou sittest over a brown crust smiling on those mangled limbs that have saved thy son and his children  if you want anything with the schoolmistress sir said the woman i can show you the way to her house  he followed her without knowing whither he went  they stopped at the door of a snug habitation where sat an elderly woman with a boy and a girl before her each of whom held a supper of bread and milk in their hands  there sir is the schoolmistress  madam said harley was not an old venerable man schoolmaster here some time ago  yes sir he was poor man the loss of his former schoolhouse i believe broke his heart for he died soon after it was taken down and as another has not yet been found i have that charge in the meantime  and this boy and girl i presume are your pupils  ay sir they are poor orphans put under my care by the parish and more promising children i never saw  orphans said harley  yes sir of honest creditable parents as any in the parish and it is a shame for some folks to forget their relations at a time when they have most need to remember them  madam said harley let us never forget that we are all relations  he kissed the children  their father sir continued she was a farmer here in the neighbourhood and a sober industrious man he was but nobody can help misfortunes what with bad crops and bad debts which are worse his affairs went to wreck and both he and his wife died of broken hearts and a sweet couple they were sir there was not a properer man to look on in the county than john edwards and so indeed were all the edwardses  what edwardses cried the old soldier hastily  the edwardses of southhill and a worthy family they were  southhill said he in a languid voice and fell back into the arms of the astonished harley  the schoolmistress ran for some water—and a smellingbottle with the assistance of which they soon recovered the unfortunate edwards  he stared wildly for some time then folding his orphan grandchildren in his arms  oh my children my children he cried have i found you thus  my poor jack art thou gone  i thought thou shouldst have carried thy fathers grey hairs to the grave and these little ones—his tears choked his utterance and he fell again on the necks of the children  my dear old man said harley providence has sent you to relieve them it will bless me if i can be the means of assisting you  yes indeed sir answered the boy father when he was adying bade god bless us and prayed that if grandfather lived he might send him to support us  where did they lay my boy said edwards  in the old churchyard replied the woman hard by his mother  i will show it you answered the boy for i have wept over it many a time when first i came amongst strange folks  he took the old mans hand harley laid hold of his sisters and they walked in silence to the churchyard  there was an old stone with the corner broken off and some letters halfcovered with moss to denote the names of the dead there was a cyphered r e plainer than the rest it was the tomb they sought  here it is grandfather said the boy  edwards gazed upon it without uttering a word the girl who had only sighed before now wept outright her brother sobbed but he stifled his sobbing  i have told sister said he that she should not take it so to heart she can knit already and i shall soon be able to dig we shall not starve sister indeed we shall not nor shall grandfather neither  the girl cried afresh harley kissed off her tears as they flowed and wept between every kiss     chapter xxxvi he returns home—a description of his retinue   it was with some difficulty that harley prevailed on the old man to leave the spot where the remains of his son were laid  at last with the assistance of the schoolmistress he prevailed and she accommodated edwards and him with beds in her house there being nothing like an inn nearer than the distance of some miles  in the morning harley persuaded edwards to come with the children to his house which was distant but a short days journey  the boy walked in his grandfathers hand and the name of edwards procured him a neighbouring farmers horse on which a servant mounted with the girl on a pillow before him  with this train harley returned to the abode of his fathers and we cannot but think that his enjoyment was as great as if he had arrived from the tour of europe with a swiss valet for his companion and half a dozen snuffboxes with invisible hinges in his pocket  but we take our ideas from sounds which folly has invented fashion bon ton and vertù are the names of certain idols to which we sacrifice the genuine pleasures of the soul in this world of semblance we are contented with personating happiness to feel it is an art beyond us  it was otherwise with harley he ran upstairs to his aunt with the history of his fellowtravellers glowing on his lips  his aunt was an economist but she knew the pleasure of doing charitable things and withal was fond of her nephew and solicitous to oblige him  she received old edwards therefore with a look of more complacency than is perhaps natural to maiden ladies of threescore and was remarkably attentive to his grandchildren she roasted apples with her own hands for their supper and made up a little bed beside her own for the girl edwards made some attempts towards an acknowledgment for these favours but his young friend stopped them in their beginnings  whosoever receiveth any of these children said his aunt for her acquaintance with her bible was habitual  early next morning harley stole into the room where edwards lay he expected to have found him abed but in this he was mistaken the old man had risen and was leaning over his sleeping grandson with the tears flowing down his cheeks  at first he did not perceive harley when he did he endeavoured to hide his grief and crossing his eyes with his hand expressed his surprise at seeing him so early astir  i was thinking of you said harley and your children i learned last night that a small farm of mine in the neighbourhood is now vacant if you will occupy it i shall gain a good neighbour and be able in some measure to repay the notice you took of me when a boy and as the furniture of the house is mine it will be so much trouble saved  edwardss tears gushed afresh and harley led him to see the place he intended for him  the house upon this farm was indeed little better than a hut its situation however was pleasant and edwards assisted by the beneficence of harley set about improving its neatness and convenience he staked out a piece of the green before for a garden and peter who acted in harleys family as valet butler and gardener had orders to furnish him with parcels of the different seeds he chose to sow in it  i have seen his master at work in this little spot with his coat off and his dibble in his hand it was a scene of tranquil virtue to have stopped an angel on his errands of mercy  harley had contrived to lead a little bubbling brook through a green walk in the middle of the ground upon which he had erected a mill in miniature for the diversion of edwardss infant grandson and made shift in its construction to introduce a pliant bit of wood that answered with its fairy clack to the murmuring of the rill that turned it  i have seen him stand listening to these mingled sounds with his eye fixed on the boy and the smile of conscious satisfaction on his cheek while the old man with a look half turned to harley and half to heaven breathed an ejaculation of gratitude and piety  father of mercies  i also would thank thee that not only hast thou assigned eternal rewards to virtue but that even in this bad world the lines of our duty and our happiness are so frequently woven together    a fragment the man of feeling talks of what he does not understand—an incident       edwards said he i have a proper regard for the prosperity of my country every native of it appropriates to himself some share of the power or the fame which as a nation it acquires but i cannot throw off the man so much as to rejoice at our conquests in india  you tell me of immense territories subject to the english i cannot think of their possessions without being led to inquire by what right they possess them they came there as traders bartering the commodities they brought for others which their purchasers could spare and however great their profits were they were then equitable  but what title have the subjects of another kingdom to establish an empire in india to give laws to a country where the inhabitants received them on the terms of friendly commerce  you say they are happier under our regulations than the tyranny of their own petty princes  i must doubt it from the conduct of those by whom these regulations have been made  they have drained the treasuries of nabobs who must fill them by oppressing the industry of their subjects  nor is this to be wondered at when we consider the motive upon which those gentlemen do not deny their going to india  the fame of conquest barbarous as that motive is is but a secondary consideration there are certain stations in wealth to which the warriors of the east aspire  it is there indeed where the wishes of their friends assign them eminence where the question of their country is pointed at their return  when shall i see a commander return from india in the pride of honourable poverty  you describe the victories they have gained they are sullied by the cause in which they fought you enumerate the spoils of those victories they are covered with the blood of the vanquished  could you tell me of some conqueror giving peace and happiness to the conquered did he accept the gifts of their princes to use them for the comfort of those whose fathers sons or husbands fell in battle did he use his power to gain security and freedom to the regions of oppression and slavery did he endear the british name by examples of generosity which the most barbarous or most depraved are rarely able to resist did he return with the consciousness of duty discharged to his country and humanity to his fellowcreatures did he return with no lace on his coat no slaves in his retinue no chariot at his door and no burgundy at his table—these were laurels which princes might envy—which an honest man would not condemn  your maxims mr harley are certainly right said edwards  i am not capable of arguing with you but i imagine there are great temptations in a great degree of riches which it is no easy matter to resist those a poor man like me cannot describe because he never knew them and perhaps i have reason to bless god that i never did for then it is likely i should have withstood them no better than my neighbours  for you know sir that it is not the fashion now as it was in former times that i have read of in books when your great generals died so poor that they did not leave wherewithal to buy them a coffin and people thought the better of their memories for it if they did so nowadays i question if any body except yourself and some few like you would thank them  i am sorry replied harley that there is so much truth in what you say but however the general current of opinion may point the feelings are not yet lost that applaud benevolence and censure inhumanity  let us endeavour to strengthen them in ourselves and we who live sequestered from the noise of the multitude have better opportunities of listening undisturbed to their voice  they now approached the little dwelling of edwards  a maidservant whom he had hired to assist him in the care of his grandchildren met them a little way from the house there is a young lady within with the children said she  edwards expressed his surprise at the visit it was however not the less true and we mean to account for it  this young lady then was no other than miss walton  she had heard the old mans history from harley as we have already related it  curiosity or some other motive made her desirous to see his grandchildren this she had an opportunity of gratifying soon the children in some of their walks having strolled as far as her fathers avenue  she put several questions to both she was delighted with the simplicity of their answers and promised that if they continued to be good children and do as their grandfather bid them she would soon see them again and bring some present or other for their reward  this promise she had performed now she came attended only by her maid and brought with her a complete suit of green for the boy and a chintz gown a cap and a suit of ribbons for his sister  she had time enough with her maids assistance to equip them in their new habiliments before harley and edwards returned  the boy heard his grandfathers voice and with that silent joy which his present finery inspired ran to the door to meet him putting one hand in his with the other pointed to his sister see said he what miss walton has brought us—edwards gazed on them harley fixed his eyes on miss walton hers were turned to the ground—in edwardss was a beamy moisture—he folded his hands together—i cannot speak young lady said he to thank you  neither could harley there were a thousand sentiments but they gushed so impetuously on his heart that he could not utter a syllable         chapter xl the man of feeling jealous   the desire of communicating knowledge or intelligence is an argument with those who hold that man is naturally a social animal  it is indeed one of the earliest propensities we discover but it may be doubted whether the pleasure for pleasure there certainly is arising from it be not often more selfish than social for we frequently observe the tidings of ill communicated as eagerly as the annunciation of good  is it that we delight in observing the effects of the stronger passions for we are all philosophers in this respect and it is perhaps amongst the spectators at tyburn that the most genuine are to be found  was it from this motive that peter came one morning into his masters room with a meaning face of recital  his master indeed did not at first observe it for he was sitting with one shoe buckled delineating portraits in the fire  i have brushed those clothes sir as you ordered me—harley nodded his head but peter observed that his hat wanted brushing too his master nodded again  at last peter bethought him that the fire needed stirring and taking up the poker demolished the turband head of a saracen while his master was seeking out a body for it  the morning is main cold sir said peter  is it said harley  yes sir i have been as far as tom dowsons to fetch some barberries he had picked for mrs margery  there was a rare junketting last night at thomass among sir harry bensons servants he lay at squire waltons but he would not suffer his servants to trouble the family so to be sure they were all at toms and had a fiddle and a hot supper in the big room where the justices meet about the destroying of hares and partridges and them things and toms eyes looked so red and so bleared when i called him to get the barberries—and i hear as how sir harry is going to be married to miss walton—how  miss walton married said harley  why it maynt be true sir for all that but toms wife told it me and to be sure the servants told her and their master told them as i guess sir but it maynt be true for all that as i said before—have done with your idle information said harley—is my aunt come down into the parlour to breakfast—yes sir—tell her ill be with her immediately  when peter was gone he stood with his eyes fixed on the ground and the last words of his intelligence vibrating in his ears  miss walton married he sighed—and walked down stairs with his shoe as it was and the buckle in his hand  his aunt however was pretty well accustomed to those appearances of absence besides that the natural gravity of her temper which was commonly called into exertion by the care of her household concerns was such as not easily to be discomposed by any circumstance of accidental impropriety  she too had been informed of the intended match between sir harry benson and miss walton  i have been thinking said she that they are distant relations for the greatgrandfather of this sir harry benson who was knight of the shire in the reign of charles the first and one of the cavaliers of those times was married to a daughter of the walton family  harley answered drily that it might be so but that he never troubled himself about those matters  indeed said she you are to blame nephew for not knowing a little more of them before i was near your age i had sewed the pedigree of our family in a set of chairbottoms that were made a present of to my grandmother who was a very notable woman and had a proper regard for gentility ill assure you but nowadays it is money not birth that makes people respected the more shame for the times  harley was in no very good humour for entering into a discussion of this question but he always entertained so much filial respect for his aunt as to attend to her discourse  we blame the pride of the rich said he but are not we ashamed of our poverty  why one would not choose replied his aunt to make a much worse figure than ones neighbours but as i was saying before the times as my friend mrs dorothy walton observes are shamefully degenerated in this respect  there was but tother day at mr waltons that fat fellows daughter the london merchant as he calls himself though i have heard that he was little better than the keeper of a chandlers shop  we were leaving the gentlemen to go to tea  she had a hoop forsooth as large and as stiff—and it showed a pair of bandy legs as thick as two—i was nearer the door by an aprons length and the pert hussy brushed by me as who should say make way for your betters and with one of her london bobs—but mrs dorothy did not let her pass with it for all the time of drinking tea she spoke of the precedency of family and the disparity there is between people who are come of something and your mushroom gentry who wear their coats of arms in their purses  her indignation was interrupted by the arrival of her maid with a damask tablecloth and a set of napkins from the loom which had been spun by her mistresss own hand  there was the family crest in each corner and in the middle a view of the battle of worcester where one of her ancestors had been a captain in the kings forces and with a sort of poetical licence in perspective there was seen the royal oak with more wig than leaves upon it  on all this the good lady was very copious and took up the remaining intervals of filling tea to describe its excellencies to harley adding that she intended this as a present for his wife when he should get one he sighed and looked foolish and commending the serenity of the day walked out into the garden  he sat down on a little seat which commanded an extensive prospect round the house  he leaned on his hand and scored the ground with his stick miss walton married said he but what is that to me  may she be happy her virtues deserve it to me her marriage is otherwise indifferent i had romantic dreams they are fled—it is perfectly indifferent  just at that moment he saw a servant with a knot of ribbons in his hat go into the house  his cheeks grew flushed at the sight  he kept his eye fixed for some time on the door by which he had entered then starting to his feet hastily followed him  when he approached the door of the kitchen where he supposed the man had entered his heart throbbed so violently that when he would have called peter his voice failed in the attempt  he stood a moment listening in this breathless state of palpitation peter came out by chance  did your honour want any thing—where is the servant that came just now from mr waltons—from mr waltons sir there is none of his servants here that i know of—nor of sir harry bensons—he did not wait for an answer but having by this time observed the hat with its particoloured ornament hanging on a peg near the door he pressed forwards into the kitchen and addressing himself to a stranger whom he saw there asked him with no small tremor in his voice if he had any commands for him  the man looked silly and said that he had nothing to trouble his honour with—are not you a servant of sir harry bensons—no sir—youll pardon me young man i judged by the favour in your hat—sir im his majestys servant god bless him and these favours we always wear when we are recruiting—recruiting his eyes glistened at the word he seized the soldiers hand and shaking it violently ordered peter to fetch a bottle of his aunts best dram  the bottle was brought you shall drink the kings health said harley in a bumper—the king and your honour—nay you shall drink the kings health by itself you may drink mine in another  peter looked in his masters face and filled with some little reluctance  now to your mistress said harley every soldier has a mistress  the man excused himself—to your mistress you cannot refuse it  twas mrs margerys best dram  peter stood with the bottle a little inclined but not so as to discharge a drop of its contents fill it peter said his master fill it to the brim  peter filled it and the soldier having named suky simpson dispatched it in a twinkling  thou art an honest fellow said harley and i love thee and shaking his hand again desired peter to make him his guest at dinner and walked up into his room with a pace much quicker and more springy than usual  this agreeable disappointment however he was not long suffered to enjoy  the curate happened that day to dine with him his visits indeed were more properly to the aunt than the nephew and many of the intelligent ladies in the parish who like some very great philosophers have the happy knack at accounting for everything gave out that there was a particular attachment between them which wanted only to be matured by some more years of courtship to end in the tenderest connection  in this conclusion indeed supposing the premises to have been true they were somewhat justified by the known opinion of the lady who frequently declared herself a friend to the ceremonial of former times when a lover might have sighed seven years at his mistresss feet before he was allowed the liberty of kissing her hand  tis true mrs margery was now about her grand climacteric no matter that is just the age when we expect to grow younger  but i verily believe there was nothing in the report the curates connection was only that of a genealogist for in that character he was no way inferior to mrs margery herself  he dealt also in the present times for he was a politician and a newsmonger  he had hardly said grace after dinner when he told mrs margery that she might soon expect a pair of white gloves as sir harry benson he was very well informed was just going to be married to miss walton  harley spilt the wine he was carrying to his mouth he had time however to recollect himself before the curate had finished the different particulars of his intelligence and summing up all the heroism he was master of filled a bumper and drank to miss walton  with all my heart said the curate the bride that is to be  harley would have said bride too but the word bride stuck in his throat  his confusion indeed was manifest but the curate began to enter on some point of descent with mrs margery and harley had very soon after an opportunity of leaving them while they were deeply engaged in a question whether the name of some great man in the time of henry the seventh was richard or humphrey  he did not see his aunt again till supper the time between he spent in walking like some troubled ghost round the place where his treasure lay  he went as far as a little gate that led into a copse near mr waltons house to which that gentleman had been so obliging as to let him have a key  he had just begun to open it when he saw on a terrace below miss walton walking with a gentleman in a ridingdress whom he immediately guessed to be sir harry benson  he stopped of a sudden his hand shook so much that he could hardly turn the key he opened the gate however and advanced a few paces  the ladys lapdog pricked up its ears and barked he stopped again—      —the little dogs and all     tray blanch and sweetheart see they bark at me  his resolution failed he slunk back and locking the gate as softly as he could stood on tiptoe looking over the wall till they were gone  at that instant a shepherd blew his horn the romantic melancholy of the sound quite overcame him—it was the very note that wanted to be touched—he sighed he dropped a tear—and returned  at supper his aunt observed that he was graver than usual but she did not suspect the cause indeed it may seem odd that she was the only person in the family who had no suspicion of his attachment to miss walton  it was frequently matter of discourse amongst the servants perhaps her maiden coldness—but for those things we need not account  in a day or two he was so much master of himself as to be able to rhyme upon the subject  the following pastoral he left some time after on the handle of a teakettle at a neighbouring house where we were visiting and as i filled the teapot after him i happened to put it in my pocket by a similar act of forgetfulness  it is such as might be expected from a man who makes verses for amusement  i am pleased with somewhat of good nature that runs through it because i have commonly observed the writers of those complaints to bestow epithets on their lost mistresses rather too harsh for the mere liberty of choice which led them to prefer another to the poet himself i do not doubt the vehemence of their passion but alas the sensations of love are something more than the returns of gratitude                                     lavinia                                   a pastoral      why steals from my bosom the sigh        why fixed is my gaze on the ground     come give me my pipe and ill try        to banish my cares with the sound      erewhile were its notes of accord        with the smile of the flowrfooted muse     ah why by its master implored        shoud it now the gay carrol refuse      twas taught by lavinias sweet smile        in the mirthloving chorus to join     ah me how unweeting the while        lavinia—can never be mine      another more happy the maid        by fortune is destind to bless—     tho the hope has forsook that betrayd        yet why should i love her the less      her beauties are bright as the morn        with rapture i counted them oer     such virtues these beauties adorn        i knew her and praisd them no more      i termd her no goddess of love        i calld not her beauty divine     these far other passions may prove        but they could not be figures of mine      it neer was appareld with art        on words it could never rely     it reignd in the throb of my heart        it gleamd in the glance of my eye      oh fool in the circle to shine        that fashions gay daughters approve     you must speak as the fashions incline        alas are there fashions in love      yet sure they are simple who prize        the tongue that is smooth to deceive     yet sure she had sense to despise        the tinsel that folly may weave      when i talkd i have seen her recline        with an aspect so pensively sweet—     tho i spoke what the shepherds opine        a fop were ashamed to repeat      she is soft as the dewdrops that fall        from the lip of the sweetscented pea     perhaps when she smild upon all        i have thought that she smild upon me      but why of her charms should i tell        ah me whom her charms have undone     yet i love the reflection too well        the painful reflection to shun      ye souls of more delicate kind        who feast not on pleasure alone     who wear the soft sense of the mind        to the sons of the world still unknown      ye know tho i cannot express        why i foolishly doat on my pain     nor will ye believe it the less        that i have not the skill to complain      i lean on my hand with a sigh        my friends the soft sadness condemn     yet methinks tho i cannot tell why        i should hate to be merry like them      when i walkd in the pride of the dawn        methought all the region lookd bright     has sweetness forsaken the lawn        for methinks i grow sad at the sight      when i stood by the stream i have thought        there was mirth in the gurgling soft sound     but now tis a sorrowful note        and the banks are all gloomy around      i have laughd at the jest of a friend        now they laugh and i know not the cause     tho i seem with my looks to attend        how silly  i ask what it was      they sing the sweet song of the may        they sing it with mirth and with glee     sure i once thought the sonnet was gay        but now tis all sadness to me      oh give me the dubious light        that gleams thro the quivering shade     oh give me the horrors of night        by gloom and by silence arrayd      let me walk where the softrising wave        has picturd the moon on its breast     let me walk where the new coverd grave        allows the pale lover to rest      when shall i in its peaceable womb        be laid with my sorrows asleep     should lavinia but chance on my tomb—        i could die if i thought she would weep      perhaps if the souls of the just        revisit these mansions of care     it may be my favourite trust        to watch oer the fate of the fair      perhaps the soft thought of her breast        with rapture more favourd to warm     perhaps if with sorrow oppressd        her sorrow with patience to arm      then then in the tenderest part        may i whisper poor colin was true     and mark if a heave of her heart        the thought of her colin pursue    the pupil a fragment      but as to the higher part of education mr harley the culture of the mind—let the feelings be awakened let the heart be brought forth to its object placed in the light in which nature would have it stand and its decisions will ever be just  the world      will smile and smile and be a villain  and the youth who does not suspect its deceit will be content to smile with it  men will put on the most forbidding aspect in nature and tell him of the beauty of virtue  i have not under these grey hairs forgotten that i was once a young man warm in the pursuit of pleasure but meaning to be honest as well as happy  i had ideas of virtue of honour of benevolence which i had never been at the pains to define but i felt my bosom heave at the thoughts of them and i made the most delightful soliloquies  it is impossible said i that there can be half so many rogues as are imagined  i travelled because it is the fashion for young men of my fortune to travel  i had a travelling tutor which is the fashion too but my tutor was a gentleman which it is not always the fashion for tutors to be his gentility indeed was all he had from his father whose prodigality had not left him a shilling to support it  i have a favour to ask of you my dear mountford said my father which i will not be refused  you have travelled as became a man neither france nor italy have made anything of mountford which mountford before he left england would have been ashamed of  my son edward goes abroad would you take him under your protection  he blushed my fathers face was scarlet  he pressed his hand to his bosom as if he had said my heart does not mean to offend you mountford sighed twice  i am a proud fool said he and you will pardon it  there he sighed again i can hear of dependance since it is dependance on my sedley  dependance answered my father there can be no such word between us what is there in £ 000 a year that should make me unworthy of mountfords friendship  they embraced and soon after i set out on my travels with mountford for my guardian  we were at milan where my father happened to have an italian friend to whom he had been of some service in england  the count for he was of quality was solicitous to return the obligation by a particular attention to his son  we lived in his palace visited with his family were caressed by his friends and i began to be so well pleased with my entertainment that i thought of england as of some foreign country  the count had a son not much older than myself  at that age a friend is an easy acquisition we were friends the first night of our acquaintance  he introduced me into the company of a set of young gentlemen whose fortunes gave them the command of pleasure and whose inclinations incited them to the purchase  after having spent some joyous evenings in their society it became a sort of habit which i could not miss without uneasiness and our meetings which before were frequent were now stated and regular  sometimes in the pauses of our mirth gaming was introduced as an amusement  it was an art in which i was a novice  i received instruction as other novices do by losing pretty largely to my teachers  nor was this the only evil which mountford foresaw would arise from the connection i had formed but a lecture of sour injunctions was not his method of reclaiming  he sometimes asked me questions about the company but they were such as the curiosity of any indifferent man might have prompted  i told him of their wit their eloquence their warmth of friendship and their sensibility of heart  and their honour said i laying my hand on my breast is unquestionable  mountford seemed to rejoice at my good fortune and begged that i would introduce him to their acquaintance  at the next meeting i introduced him accordingly  the conversation was as animated as usual  they displayed all that sprightliness and goodhumour which my praises had led mountford to expect subjects too of sentiment occurred and their speeches particularly those of our friend the son of count respino glowed with the warmth of honour and softened into the tenderness of feeling mountford was charmed with his companions  when we parted he made the highest eulogiums upon them  when shall we see them again said he  i was delighted with the demand and promised to reconduct him on the morrow  in going to their place of rendezvous he took me a little out of the road to see as he told me the performances of a young statuary  when we were near the house in which mountford said he lived a boy of about seven years old crossed us in the street  at sight of mountford he stopped and grasping his hand  my dearest sir said he my father is likely to do well  he will live to pray for you and to bless you  yes he will bless you though you are an englishman and some other hard word that the monk talked of this morning which i have forgot but it meant that you should not go to heaven but he shall go to heaven said i for he has saved my father come and see him sir that we may be happy  my dear i am engaged at present with this gentleman  but he shall come along with you he is an englishman too i fancy he shall come and learn how an englishman may go to heaven  mountford smiled and we followed the boy together  after crossing the next street we arrived at the gate of a prison  i seemed surprised at the sight our little conductor observed it  are you afraid sir said he  i was afraid once too but my father and mother are here and i am never afraid when i am with them  he took my hand and led me through a dark passage that fronted the gate  when we came to a little door at the end he tapped  a boy still younger than himself opened it to receive us  mountford entered with a look in which was pictured the benign assurance of a superior being  i followed in silence and amazement  on something like a bed lay a man with a face seemingly emaciated with sickness and a look of patient dejection  a bundle of dirty shreds served him for a pillow but he had a better support—the arm of a female who kneeled beside him beautiful as an angel but with a fading languor in her countenance the still life of melancholy that seemed to borrow its shade from the object on which she gazed  there was a tear in her eye—the sick man kissed it off in its bud smiling through the dimness of his own—when she saw mountford she crawled forward on the ground and clasped his knees  he raised her from the floor she threw her arms round his neck and sobbed out a speech of thankfulness eloquent beyond the power of language  compose yourself my love said the man on the bed but he whose goodness has caused that emotion will pardon its effects  how is this mountford said i what do i see  what must i do  you see replied the stranger a wretch sunk in poverty starving in prison stretched on a sick bed  but that is little  there are his wife and children wanting the bread which he has not to give them  yet you cannot easily imagine the conscious serenity of his mind  in the gripe of affliction his heart swells with the pride of virtue it can even look down with pity on the man whose cruelty has wrung it almost to bursting  you are i fancy a friend of mr mountfords  come nearer and ill tell you for short as my story is i can hardly command breath enough for a recital  the son of count respino i started as if i had trod on a viper has long had a criminal passion for my wife  this her prudence had concealed from me but he had lately the boldness to declare it to myself  he promised me affluence in exchange for honour and threatened misery as its attendant if i kept it  i treated him with the contempt he deserved the consequence was that he hired a couple of bravoes for i am persuaded they acted under his direction who attempted to assassinate me in the street but i made such a defence as obliged them to fly after having given me two or three stabs none of which however were mortal  but his revenge was not thus to be disappointed  in the little dealings of my trade i had contracted some debts of which he had made himself master for my ruin  i was confined here at his suit when not yet recovered from the wounds i had received the dear woman and these two boys followed me that we might starve together but providence interposed and sent mr mountford to our support  he has relieved my family from the gnawings of hunger and rescued me from death to which a fever consequent on my wounds and increased by the want of every necessary had almost reduced me  inhuman villain i exclaimed lifting up my eyes to heaven  inhuman indeed said the lovely woman who stood at my side  alas sir what had we done to offend him what had these little ones done that they should perish in the toils of his vengeance  i reached a pen which stood in the inkstand dish at the bedside  may i ask what is the amount of the sum for which you are imprisoned  i was able he replied to pay all but five hundred crowns  i wrote a draft on the banker with whom i had a credit from my father for   00 and presenting it to the strangers wife  you will receive madam on presenting this note a sum more than sufficient for your husbands discharge the remainder i leave for his industry to improve  i would have left the room  each of them laid hold of one of my hands the children clung to my coat  oh mr harley methinks i feel their gentle violence at this moment it beats here with delight inexpressible  stay sir said he i do not mean attempting to thank you he took a pocketbook from under his pillow let me but know what name i shall place here next to mr mountford  sedley  he writ it down  an englishman too i presume  he shall go to heaven notwithstanding said the boy who had been our guide  it began to be too much for me  i squeezed his hand that was clasped in mine his wifes i pressed to my lips and burst from the place to give vent to the feelings that laboured within me  oh mountford said i when he had overtaken me at the door  it is time replied he that we should think of our appointment young respino and his friends are waiting us  damn him damn him said i  let us leave milan instantly but soft—i will be calm mountford your pencil  i wrote on a slip of paper                               to signor respino      when you receive this i am at a distance from milan  accept of my     thanks for the civilities i have received from you and your family     as to the friendship with which you were pleased to honour me the     prison which i have just left has exhibited a scene to cancel it     for ever  you may possibly be merry with your companions at my     weakness as i suppose you will term it  i give you leave for     derision  you may affect a triumph i shall feel it                                                            edward sedley  you may send this if you will said mountford coolly but still respino is a man of honour the world will continue to call him so  it is probable i answered they may i envy not the appellation  if this is the worlds honour if these men are the guides of its manners—  tut said mountford do you eat macaroni—                                        at this place had the greatest depredations of the curate begun  there were so very few connected passages of the subsequent chapters remaining that even the partiality of an editor could not offer them to the public i discovered from some scattered sentences that they were of much the same tenor with the preceding recitals of little adventures in which the dispositions of a man sensible to judge and still more warm to feel had room to unfold themselves  some instruction and some example i make no doubt they contained but it is likely that many of those whom chance has led to a perusal of what i have already presented may have read it with little pleasure and will feel no disappointment from the want of those parts which i have been unable to procure  to such as may have expected the intricacies of a novel a few incidents in a life undistinguished except by some features of the heart cannot have afforded much entertainment  harleys own story from the mutilated passages i have mentioned as well as from some inquiries i was at the trouble of making in the country i found to have been simple to excess  his mistress i could perceive was not married to sir harry benson but it would seem by one of the following chapters which is still entire that harley had not profited on the occasion by making any declaration of his own passion after those of the other had been unsuccessful  the state of his health for some part of this period appears to have been such as to forbid any thoughts of that kind he had been seized with a very dangerous fever caught by attending old edwards in one of an infectious kind  from this he had recovered but imperfectly and though he had no formed complaint his health was manifestly on the decline  it appears that the sagacity of some friend had at length pointed out to his aunt a cause from which this might be supposed to proceed to wit his hopeless love for miss walton for according to the conceptions of the world the love of a man of harleys fortune for the heiress of £ 000 a year is indeed desperate  whether it was so in this case may be gathered from the next chapter which with the two subsequent concluding the performance have escaped those accidents that proved fatal to the rest     chapter lv he sees miss walton and is happy   harley was one of those few friends whom the malevolence of fortune had yet left me i could not therefore but be sensibly concerned for his present indisposition there seldom passed a day on which i did not make inquiry about him  the physician who attended him had informed me the evening before that he thought him considerably better than he had been for some time past i called next morning to be confirmed in a piece of intelligence so welcome to me  when i entered his apartment i found him sitting on a couch leaning on his hand with his eye turned upwards in the attitude of thoughtful inspiration  his look had always an open benignity which commanded esteem there was now something more—a gentle triumph in it  he rose and met me with his usual kindness  when i gave him the good accounts i had had from his physician i am foolish enough said he to rely but little in this instance upon physic my presentiment may be false but i think i feel myself approaching to my end by steps so easy that they woo me to approach it  there is a certain dignity in retiring from life at a time when the infirmities of age have not sapped our faculties  this world my dear charles was a scene in which i never much delighted  i was not formed for the bustle of the busy nor the dissipation of the gay a thousand things occurred where i blushed for the impropriety of my conduct when i thought on the world though my reason told me i should have blushed to have done otherwise—it was a scene of dissimulation of restraint of disappointment  i leave it to enter on that state which i have learned to believe is replete with the genuine happiness attendant upon virtue i look back on the tenor of my life with the consciousness of few great offences to account for  there are blemishes i confess which deform in some degree the picture  but i know the benignity of the supreme being and rejoice at the thoughts of its exertion in my favour  my mind expands at the thought i shall enter into the society of the blessed wise as angels with the simplicity of children  he had by this time clasped my hand and found it wet by a tear which had just fallen upon it—his eye began to moisten too—we sat for some time silent—at last with an attempt to a look of more composure there are some remembrances said harley which rise involuntary on my heart and make me almost wish to live  i have been blessed with a few friends who redeem my opinion of mankind  i recollect with the tenderest emotion the scenes of pleasure i have passed among them but we shall meet again my friend never to be separated  there are some feelings which perhaps are too tender to be suffered by the world—the world is in general selfish interested and unthinking and throws the imputation of romance or melancholy on every temper more susceptible than its own  i cannot think but in those regions which i contemplate if there is any thing of mortality left about us that these feelings will subsist—they are called—perhaps they are—weaknesses here—but there may be some better modifications of them in heaven which may deserve the name of virtues he sighed as he spoke these last words  he had scarcely finished them when the door opened and his aunt appeared leading in miss walton  my dear said she here is miss walton who has been so kind as to come and inquire for you herself  i could observe a transient glow upon his face  he rose from his seat—if to know miss waltons goodness said he be a title to deserve it i have some claim  she begged him to resume his seat and placed herself on the sofa beside him  i took my leave  mrs margery accompanied me to the door  he was left with miss walton alone  she inquired anxiously about his health  i believe said he from the accounts which my physicians unwillingly give me that they have no great hopes of my recovery—she started as he spoke but recollecting herself immediately endeavoured to flatter him into a belief that his apprehensions were groundless  i know said he that it is usual with persons at my time of life to have these hopes which your kindness suggests but i would not wish to be deceived  to meet death as becomes a man is a privilege bestowed on few—i would endeavour to make it mine—nor do i think that i can ever be better prepared for it than now—it is that chiefly which determines the fitness of its approach  those sentiments answered miss walton are just but your good sense mr harley will own that life has its proper value—as the province of virtue life is ennobled as such it is to be desired—to virtue has the supreme director of all things assigned rewards enough even here to fix its attachment  the subject began to overpower her—harley lifted his eyes from the ground—there are said he in a very low voice there are attachments miss walton—his glance met hers—they both betrayed a confusion and were both instantly withdrawn—he paused some moments—i am such a state as calls for sincerity let that also excuse it—it is perhaps the last time we shall ever meet  i feel something particularly solemn in the acknowledgment yet my heart swells to make it awed as it is by a sense of my presumption by a sense of your perfections—he paused again—let it not offend you to know their power over one so unworthy—it will i believe soon cease to beat even with that feeling which it shall lose the latest—to love miss walton could not be a crime—if to declare it is one—the expiation will be made—her tears were now flowing without control—let me intreat you said she to have better hopes—let not life be so indifferent to you if my wishes can put any value on it—i will not pretend to misunderstand you—i know your worth—i have known it long—i have esteemed it—what would you have me say—i have loved it as it deserved—he seized her hand—a languid colour reddened his cheek—a smile brightened faintly in his eye  as he gazed on her it grew dim it fixed it closed—he sighed and fell back on his seat—miss walton screamed at the sight—his aunt and the servants rushed into the room—they found them lying motionless together—his physician happened to call at that instant  every art was tried to recover them—with miss walton they succeeded—but harley was gone for ever     chapter lvi the emotions of the heart   i entered the room where his body lay i approached it with reverence not fear i looked the recollection of the past crowded upon me  i saw that form which but a little before was animated with a soul which did honour to humanity stretched without sense or feeling before me  tis a connection we cannot easily forget—i took his hand in mine i repeated his name involuntary—i felt a pulse in every vein at the sound  i looked earnestly in his face his eye was closed his lip pale and motionless  there is an enthusiasm in sorrow that forgets impossibility i wondered that it was so  the sight drew a prayer from my heart it was the voice of frailty and of man the confusion of my mind began to subside into thought i had time to meet  i turned with the last farewell upon my lips when i observed old edwards standing behind me  i looked him full in the face but his eye was fixed on another object he pressed between me and the bed and stood gazing on the breathless remains of his benefactor  i spoke to him i know not what but he took no notice of what i said and remained in the same attitude as before  he stood some minutes in that posture then turned and walked towards the door  he paused as he went—he returned a second time i could observe his lips move as he looked but the voice they would have uttered was lost  he attempted going again and a third time he returned as before—i saw him wipe his cheek then covering his face with his hands his breast heaving with the most convulsive throbs he flung out of the room     the conclusion   he had hinted that he should like to be buried in a certain spot near the grave of his mother  this is a weakness but it is universally incident to humanity tis at least a memorial for those who survive for some indeed a slender memorial will serve—and the soft affections when they are busy that way will build their structures were it but on the paring of a nail  he was buried in the place he had desired  it was shaded by an old tree the only one in the churchyard in which was a cavity worn by time  i have sat with him in it and counted the tombs  the last time we passed there methought he looked wistfully on the tree there was a branch of it that bent towards us waving in the wind he waved his hand as if he mimicked its motion  there was something predictive in his look perhaps it is foolish to remark it but there are times and places when i am a child at those things  i sometimes visit his grave i sit in the hollow of the tree  it is worth a thousand homilies every noble feeling rises within me every beat of my heart awakens a virtue—but it will make you hate the world—no there is such an air of gentleness around that i can hate nothing but as to the world—i pity the men of it     footnotes       the reader will remember that the editor is accountable only for scattered chapters and fragments of chapters the curate must answer for the rest  the number at the top when the chapter was entire he has given as it originally stood with the title which its author had affixed to it      though the curate could not remember having shown this chapter to anybody i strongly suspect that these political observations are the work of a later pen than the rest of this performance  there seems to have been by some accident a gap in the manuscript from the words expectation at a jointure to these in short man is an animal where the present blank ends and some other person for the hand is different and the ink whiter has filled part of it with sentiments of his own  whoever he was he seems to have caught some portion of the spirit of the man he personates
