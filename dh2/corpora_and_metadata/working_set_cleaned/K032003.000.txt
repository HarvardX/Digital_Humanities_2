antidotaria or a collection of antidotes against the plague and other malignant diseases  together with some decent and useful remarks on the late pharmacopeia londinensis in a letter to the president and college of physicians showing the necessity of a farther reformation of their new london dispensatory  by joseph brown llmd  london printed for j wilcox at the greendragon in littlebritain and sold by j roberts in warwick lane       to the most eminently learned the president and community of the royal college of physicians london gentlemen the intention of the following pages with difference to your illustrious body is with all submission laid at your feet carrying no other views along with it than to promote the further knowledge of medicine the exact and artful composition of which is so highly necessary and conducive to the welfare of mankind and the utility of the public  i rest assured of a candid reception from the nature of the design which i have the vanity to think you will favor because it is only levelled at a reformation some of the errors in composition that have crept into former and are still retained in your last edition of the london dispensatory and a further recommendation of the many excellent prescriptions which you have with justice to the profession continued and published to the world all which i shall endeavor to support by authority reason and experience hence i flatter myself with every thing that can be expected from a society so distinguished for universal literature as well as their particular knowledge in medicine  this is a mere trifle which i offer only as an essay to what i have ready for the press and to which i doubt not of your generous approbation for as the study of your lives is devoted to do good so you will certainly promote every thing that tends to that great end and what is of more importance than to preserve life and restore to man that valuable blessing of health  this collection of antidotes although no epidemical disease should happen which god in his mercy avert is of universal tendency and speaks for itself the authors were all physicians of great experience some of whom lived through five or six plagues in which they had been singularly successful and after that devouring flame was extinguished they had in all their succeeding practice still a mighty esteem for such antidotes and alexipharmicks as had been serviceable to them when they stood so much in need of their assistance on which occasion they invented and introduced a whole set or collection of em into practice among which you have the various prescriptions of sir walter rawleighs great cordial that of sir kenelm digbys diaphoretick gascoyne powder with the goastone and a great variety of the lapis contrayerva with many others all which are very valuable in their kinds and consequently i doubt not but the publication of this will meet with a reception equal to the merits of those learned gentlemen who were the compilers of the several recipes and prescriptions therein contained which were certainly studied and found useful for the public service  now let me beg leave of your learned society to make some decent and modest remarks upon your last edition of your pharmacopeia that from the justness of those observations you yourselves may judge of the necessity there is for a reformation of the same and from the specimens i shall give make the world sensible of the usefulness of such an undertaking which with the last regards due to your venerable body i submit to impartial judgment and in the first place i shall not wast time either upon the method or materials you have made choice of in the simples conducive to your dispensatory whether roots barks woods herbs flowers fruits seeds or the like but do think it would have been a justice due to the public as well as an advantage to the profession to have informed them which of those simples most constantly are in use which are seldom used and which are never used at all which things are very material that time and money may not be thrown away upon what is perfectly useless as the roots of anthorae an exotic called the counterpoison to monkshood not traffickd in and of no virtues that are recommended by the experience of the faculty  dly arundinis saccharina the common reed and sugarcane roots of no medicinal use the roots of kings spear or asphodel male and female not used or even sold in the druggist or apothecaries shops and many more  the next are those which are seldom or very rarely used such as the hermodactyls woad fullers thistle hogfennel stinking gladon and an hundred others mentioned to little or no purpose which had been better left out both for the ease of the apothecary and the prescriber who is at first embarrassd in so large a field of materials loaded by some authors with great encocomiums of the feats they have done in physic which are too apt to flatter and disappoint the presumptions of a young practitioner  i shall pass by the rest of the simples in this short account and leave em to a stricter enquiry when i come to publish the pharmacopeia reformata and so proceed to some more material observations among which i shall first take notice of the oxymel scilliticum which you have prescribed just in the same manner as formerly viz three pounds of clarified honey to two pounds of vinegar of squills whereas in justness to the operation and effects of this medicine here should be three pounds of vinegar of squills to two pounds of honey otherwise the medecin is so clogged with the honey that the efficacy thereof is lost and the acetum has not power to assist the digestion cut the viscous phlegm discharge wind and sour belchings from the stomach and strengthen the appetite for which it is a noble remedy was it not so very nauseous but it may be excellently adapted by a skillful and judicious physician who by mixing equal parts of the acetum scilliticum and oxymel will gain his intentions  i cannot be surpised that you have overlooked this among so many other compositions which are so faulty that they are not capable of being made up or if they could would be of no use since you are pleased to persist in your daily practice to prescribe galbanum along with ammoniacum in order to be dissolved in black cherrywater or other the like vehicle and are angry with the apothecary when he tells you plain that he knows not how to dissolve galbanum in an aqueous body though ammoniacum will familiarly do it if this point had been cleared up in your last edition of the london dispensatory and new rules given to the apothecary how to make his dissolution of galbanum this would have been a great improvement and given a new turn to the dispensations of medicines but till then we shall believe it was not so artfully corrected as we had reason to expect from persons so well qualified otherwise the spiritus lavendulae compositus would hardly have remained in the condition it stands considering it is such a farrago of inconsistences unskilfully blended the produce of which is nothing at all when at the same time the simple spirit of lavender is so excellently useful and may be enriched at the physicians pleasure with all the volatile aromaticks etc according to the nature of the case becoming by this means a spiritus lavendulae extemporaneo compositus  your aqua paeoniae composita or peonywater compound is an excellent prescription but wants much of what it was from langius who calls it his epileptick water which receipt i shall give you as it was originally in the pharmacopeia reformata in the interim it is high time to expunge gilberts water least some evil minded people should deceive themselves and others in putting their trust therein  as to the treacle of audromachus and mithridate of which i can find no reformation made in your last edition it is one grand medley of a multitude of simples jumbld together without order or design the greatest part of which are either useless or ineffectual i shall satisfy my own opinion only to declare that as generally used and applied they are both dangerous medicines ill prepared very hot and of disagreeable qualities to the intentions they are administered the grand reason that has induced all sorts of people to the use of them have been drawn from the authority and experience of the ancients galen says they has spoken in praise of treacle in two pieces of his directed to piso and pamphilianus to which i answer that the authority cited is of no force because they do not appear to be galens writings but falsely attributed to him which is the more evident from the style and manner of writing which is foreign from that of galens besides there are several terms and words made use of not elsewhere to be found in the said authors works according to the learned mercurialis who says in eo plurima verba a galeno nusquam usurpata fabulosae aliqua and stylus totus pene diversus reperiuntur the same author says there ought not to be the least fault in any of the simples that enter that composition speaking of treacle vitium enim unius medicamenti totum compositionem evertit  every body knows the great abuse in the choice of vipers and that of the malabathrum which not one in an hundred makes a right use of besides this the myrrh we use setting aside the smell is nothing like that described by dioscorides but rather bdelliams whereas the troglotick is the fame and we have no opobalsamum true costus schaenanth dictamny of crete or falernian wine the generality of the opium used at this day is nothing near so fine or good as mathiolus relates and scarce seems to be like what dioscorides describes for it is a perfect meconium at this day as may be evidently proved  the mithridate commonly met with in the shops is in the same condition having the same faults and imperfections and therefore ought to be rejected being too hot and acrid for the intentions it is generally prescribed consequently it wants a considerable reformation or else ought to be expunged the dispensatory  the confection of alkermes although very prudently divested of its perfumes now adays is a composition very unartfully invented and described by the arabians and very little reformed and amended by the moderns who still closely pursue the errors of the arabian physicians indeed the lapis laruli has been long since thrown out and there remains little behind in this medicine which bears a high name but what we may expect from the juice or syrup of the chermesberry with better success for as to the aloes wood we know little or nothing of it and the leafgold therein is a mere amusement to deceive the credulous rondeletius instead of speaking in its praise gives a severe caution against the use of it which is backed by mr ferrier a physician of toulouse who blames physicians for the too plentiful prescribing thereof see the annotations and observations of mr guillemeau the confect of hyacinth bears a great resemblance to this only that the last seems to be endowed with no cordial virtue at all notwithanding the great boasts made of it from the fragments of preciousstones that enter the composition by the splendid show of which together with the leafgold many are induced to believe it is capable of performing wonders  as i was treating of mithridate i must take the liberty to return to the subject to show that when pompey found the receipt thereof written in mithridates own hand after the defeat of that prince which he esteemed as a vaulable secret it was compounded but of very few simples and those very common ones according to the following distick  antidotus vero multis mithridatica fertur consociata modis sed magnus scrinia regis cum rapperet victor vilem deprendit in illis synthesim and vulgata satis medicamina risit bis denum rutae folium salis and brevegranum juglandasque duas totidem cum corpore ficus naecortente die pauco conspersa lyaeo sumebat metuens dederatque pocula tutor this composition then consisted only of two walnuts two figs twenty leaves of rue stamped together with a little salt and this was reckoned a sovereign antidote against any maglignant air for    hours together it being sufficient for three or four morning doses drinking after it a glass of white wine  the next thing to be inquired into is to know the reason why you still admit leafgold into several preparations since you very well know it is neither cordial corroborative alterative or does it any wise contribute to the nutrition of the parts according to galen in his commentary on the first book of hippocrates de ratione victus in acutis it can by no means be called an alterative in that the natural disposition of the body cannot be affected by reason of the solidity of its parts so that it can neither heat or cool dry or moisten the solid or fluid parts and how it becomes purgative i cannot imagine all which makes good what julius caesar scaliger says in his exercitations against cardan exerc     there ought to be some resemblance some likeness in configuration of parts between what gives the nutriment and the body that receives it metals are proper to unite with and feed metals but are imcompatible and foreign to the subsistence and increase of animals if gold is good in any disease it must certainly be so in the hypochondriack melancholy especially when it is administered not as the arabians in pills or powders or as the chemists in potions like their aurum potabile but plentifully in specie or golden showers nay if the physician could but prescribe bank bills his prescriptions would infallibly cure all the vapors in town this is a specific even against south sea headache which is otherwise an incurable disease  and here i cannot forbear to hint at the present use of ivory that is still continued and recommended in many good medicines when every body knows and is thoroughly persuaded that hartshorn has an hundred times the virtue since the other neither discovers smell or taste or any quality to recommend it for an efficacious medicine several physicians have long since exploded it as durel hantin mercurialis baccius sylvaticus erastus albertus sebizius and others but ambrose parey by dint of reason and experience refutes all the pretended and imaginary qualities assigned to this useless and insignificant drug  therefore it becomes more my admiration that gentlemen who have consulted and weighed all these things together in the balance of reason should still continue the use of many useless and extravagant drugs which are now directed in the several compositions of your dispensatory many of which are rarely or not to be got at all and others at a very dear rate and good for little or nothing the first of which i mean is the bone of a stags heart the others are ambergreese musk and bezoar so frequently prescribed on all occasions in the last of which there are so many vile cheats practiced that it is a pity it should lie in the power of avaritious and designing men to cozen and deceive the world with such vile frauds  two parts in three of the bezoar of which is sold and made use of in the shops is factitious and the other that is natural is only fit to deceive such as are willing to be deceived and take a pleasure to be carried down with the stream of popular errors as to the factitious it is generally made up of gallstones found in the gallbladders of oxen etc and lemnian earth findly ground with a little ambergreese and so formed into stones of various sizes and figures and thus the subtle artist cheats the apothecary with his counterfeit stone and the physician comes into the confederacy by prescribing his bezoartick bolus or powder to pick the patients pocket this fallacy upon the credulous sick will in a little time become as despicable as the vain pretentions of the alchymists with their aurum potatabile their sulphur of metals and powder of projection with which they bubble the ignorant and blind the eyes of the more discerning part of mankind  i hope to god that you gentlemen who have both honor justice and judgment will put a stop to these deceits whereby the people are cheated with false medicines which under the pompous pretensions of curing more effectually are made a handle of to extract gold and silver from the patients purse a reformation of these things would be a great advantage to all parties and who can we expect it from but your learned body who by your example and authority have power to reform and at the same time inform the world what your opinions are in relation to such costly drugs as bezoar and whether the good effects and virtues thereof are answerable to the physicians expectation and that of the patient if not that you would ingeniously declare this stone naturally as brought from india and unsophistieated has no more virtue than some of our foreign earths or domestic chalks  it is pretended by the advocates for this stone that it is a most noble alexipharmick and is both cordial and sudorifick though it does not appear from the composition of its parts being gross and earthy how it can increase or otherwise alter the motion of the blood or exhilerate the spirits which it seems not to have power to fortify and support if this be so then let us submit to the force of truth which we find published in the writings of some of the best physicians of europe which mr guybert has accurately quoted let us submit opinion i say to truth which is one and the same throughout the world nic boccangelinus physician to the empress and a very knowing spaniard in a treatise of malignant and pestilential fevers chap    condemns the use of bezoar thus some make up cordial powders with bezoar pearl coral etc which strangely deceive them for all these things increase the obstructions which encourage the fever the materials being gross earthy and unactive foul the stomach clog the lacterals and stop the mesaraick vessels so that the blood which is contaminated with the malignant vapors has not power hereby to refine itself hieron ruleus a learned physician of ravenna in his commentaries on the  th chap of the  d book of celsus exposes the cheat after this manner i own says he having often prescribed the bezoar stone in malignant and other fevers to several persons of quality from   to    grains i never could observe any good effect from it by any sensible operation or amendment in the patient but this we commonly prescribe to the rich and great by way of complement it being very dear besides let me caution you says he for there are a great many counterfeit or false stones which i found by experience in the last sickness of pope clement the  th so that out of forty which were brought me i could scarce meet with one good one  martianus a roman physician in his commentaries upon hippocrates says that the bezoar stone is nothing else but a mere name and opinion without any virtue which he knows to be true upon repeated trials rodericus a fonseca a celebrated professor at padua in a tract of his on malignant fevers ingenuously owns that he never saw any laudable effect from it though he had frequently used it johannes colle a learned italian and physician to the d of urbino in a book of his called cosmitor medicans or a large treatise of the bezoar stone makes severe remarks on those who boast of the virtues of bezoar without any reason and on those who use it in all diseases like a stall for all horses theodorus angelutius speaking of the cure of malignant fevers condemns it in these words i advise all physicians says he against the use of this stone since it is a drug that is good for nothing at the best and all men of sincerity who are most worthy of credit confess it and i myself solemnly protest that i never could find the sick relieved thereby how easy it is then for every one to judge of the danger there is in confiding in so uncertain and frivolous a medicine when the patient labors under a malignant fever instead of a better approved and more successful remedy thomas minadous in his book of fevers says thus i cannot so much as admit or have ever met with any occult quality in this bezoar stone by which means it could prove serviceable in any kind of fevers and therefore believe they are all fabulous accounts and old womens tales that have been told either by the arabians or the moderns for i have tried it several times in several diseases without finding any relief or advantage from it aloisius mundella in his experiments on simple medicines confirms what all the rest have said whom i have quoted before  permit me most excellent and learned colleagues to say a word or two about the drug sena which enters so many of your well chosen compositions and which i have the vanity to think you have not all met with in the common treatises of simple medicines though the subject fell in my way when i consulted all the authors i could then come at in compiling my history of drugs from pomet lemery tournefort etc the sena which mesue from the persians calls abalzemer is a plant or shrub the leaves whereof resemble those of liquorice it shoots up and spreads with many small branches which are very pliant the flowers are yellow with certain threads or red streaks underneath after which shoot forth certain follicula or buds closely folded which hang upon the plant by a slender tail which is very fine and naturally flat these buds when ripe easily fall by the force of the wind and contain in them a seed which is of a greenish black color and so like the stone of a raisin that it is hard to know the difference serapion in his book of simples says these buds are longish and in form of a cross in which the seed is lodged they are much deceived who think that the tree which theophrastus calls colutea to be our sena because the colutea which the french call baguenaudier bears large follicules or buds which the shepherds and pesants gather to feed their cattle with besides there is a vast difference in that the sena is an herb or plant that lasts but a few months and the bagnenaudier is a tree that continues many years notwithstanding which the same virtues have been ascribed to the last as to that of sena and the merchant imposed upon as well as the druggist in buying the one for the other mesue says that the sena has much more virtue and efficacy in the bud than the leaf especially if of the dark green color a little bitterish stiptick and astringent in taste and gathered when fresh for otherwise the virtue is lost the white buds are good for nothing the green leaves better than the white and the thick ones than the thin but the stalks of no use at all and this agrees very well with what matthiolus writes in his learned commentaries on dioscorides he says indeed there are two sorts of these buds the one of which is gathered when dry and fallen from the plant which have no virtue in them and the other is gathered upon the plant before it is dry and withered and these are thick leaves and full of sap being afterward skillfully dried in the shade  manardus a physician of ferrara maintains that the leaves of the sena have a greater purgative quality than the buds but then he takes em for such as dropped from the tree ready dried but fernelius who was undoubtedly a more knowing judge of medicine follows mesue and matthiolus in preferring the buds to the leaves and sylvius subscribes to the same opinion in his commentaries upon mesue whoever has a mind to use the buds must observe this description but such as like the leaves better must choose those of the brightest color large and fresh and free from all smell rejecting the pale and dead colored as useless our druggists are often very negligent in mixing all together without choice or distinction with submission to the more learned i think we generally under dose this medicine in our compositions and preseriptions serapion orders from a dram to two drams in powder and half an ounce to five drams in decoction actuarius only one dram and in decoction half an ounce fernelius directs two drams in powder and six in decoction but half an ounce in the infusion your london dispensatory prescribes only a scruple of sena in powder and half a scruple of rhubarb and polypody in seven drams of electuarium catholicum and two drams only in the decoction of gereon and in the lenitive electuary to one ounce a dram of sena with a scruple of that and polypody in decoction in the larger compound powder of sena half a dram and in the less    grains the magisterial syrup of apples has a dram of sena to an ounce but the purging syrup only a scruple infused to six drams syrup of roses with sena has indeed a dram to six drams of the syrup i shall conclude this head with the form of a purging potion of sena from an eminent physician of our own who practiced upwards of sixty years  take of fine sena cut small six drams salt of tartar two drams juice of lemons one ounce white wine four ounces infuse six or seven hours in a glass vessel then strain and infuse therein all night electuary of carthamum three drams the juice of apples one ounce in the morning clarify this with the white of an egg and to the strained liquor add syrup of roses with agarick six drams cinamonwater two drams the zest of half an orange peel notwithstanding the large quantity of sena this is a medicine of a nice and delicate operation without giving gripes or colic and yet moves ten or twelve times  in order to introduce our antidotaria it may not be amiss to give a specimen of the reformation of two grand prescriptions which i have already hinted at to be faulty in the pharmacopeia londinensis viz the confect of alkermes and that of hyacinth  the confection of alkermes reformed take the juice of kermes sweet apples and raspberries of each strained lbij sugar of roses lbij mix and by a gentle fire boil to the consistence of honey the aperitive saffron or crocus martis iij red rose buds reduced to a powder after having been first steeped in juice of

added at the discretion of the physician but it is judged much better to be left out this composition is preferable to that of the shops for the intentions aimed at being more cordial and specifical to drive away melancholy and the malignity of the bilous juices besides it is better appropriated to stop fluxes and to restore strength  the confection of hyacinth reformed take of the seeds of

described book   chap    the seed of the hyacinth says he is astringent and proper for the compotision of treacles myrrh is omitted because of its ungrateful taste and as to the perfumers of musk and ambergreese they may be added at the discretion of the prescriber but this electuary seems better adapted than that of the shops being more cordial and restorative and may be used with good effect in malignant disenterys and profuse diarrhaeas as also pestilential fevers smallpox etc  antidotaria or a collection of antidotes etc i designed to have given you sir walter rawleighs great cordial from

and the vessel being cool the magma or caput mortum with what is sublimed must be ground together in a glass mortar and water put in therewith to the alembick drive this over again and repeat it   or   times but give a large degree of fire to the last that the sublimation may be exactly regular the glasses being cold collect your sublimate then grind it again on a marble and in a small sublimating furnace sublime it thirty or forty times grinding it fine every time theoftener the better the last time it must be reduced to an impalpable powder and put it into a silver or gold vessel to which

contrayerva or drake root is an indian plant which some judge to be of the nature of tormentil this was first introduced into france in   0  and much prescribed by the physicians at paris in the piague there at that time when it proved of excellent service the root is tuberose and knotty shooting forth many hairs or fibers of a yellowish or rather brown color which when chewed gives an aromatic flavor and leaves an heat upon the tongue though no bitterness or stipticity is observable this grows in both the indies but most plentifully in the west in the kingdom of peru and that part called ciarche and tonsuglar the indians use it for sallet they much covet the root which they cut in pieces and put under the soles of their feet in winter time the goats from eating of this plant are said to generate the bezoar stone for the indians observe those goats of which there are several kinds of which one is called bicuqua and those which do not feed upon this plant never generate any of these stones so that according to this notion their bezoar seems to be a concretion of tartar or the faeculent part of the aliment formed from the digestion of the contrayerva plant  the stone in india is made from the juice of the root and the whole plant together this is reduced into paste and so formed into stones of various sizes the root is given from a dram to two and has had the power to throw out boils blains and carbuncles with great success in the plague time which encouraged the physicians to invent several compositions there from  the general materials for the contrayerva
