patronage a work of this kind may so properly claim as yours your private life having done so much honor to the moral part and your public one such justice to the principal characters represented in our authors writings  your action has been a better comment on his text than all his editors have been able to supply you mark his beauties they but clear his blots you impress us with the living spirit they only present us the dead letter  there is one striking similarity between shakespeare and you in a very uncommon particular he is the only dramatic writer who ever alike excelled in tragedy and comedy and we may without flattery venture to affim that you are the only performer who ever appeared with equal advantage both in the sock and buskin  if i had an higher opinion of this work than i have i should have still but an higher inducement for addressing it to you from this consideration you are bound to receive it with all its imperfections on its head being offered as a tribute of that friendship and esteem with which i have the honor to be  sir your much obliged and most obedient servant e g november        preface among the many writers of our nation who have by their talents contributed to entertain inform or improve our minds no one has so happily or universally succeeded as he whom we may justly style our first our greatest poet shakespeare for more than a century and a half this author has been the delight of the ingenious the text of the moralist and the study of the philosopher even his cotemporary writers have ingenuously yielded their plaudit to his fame as not presuming it could lessen theirs set at so great a distance such superior excellence could never be brought into a comparative light and jealousy is dumb when competition must be vain for him then they cheerfully twined the laurelwreath and unrepining placed it on his brow where it will ever bloom while sense taste and natural feelings of the heart shall remain amongst the characteristics of this or any other nation that can be able to construe his language he is a classic and cotemporary with all ages  true natures drama represents all time though old the last the first retains its prime but amidst all this burst of applause one single discordant voice is faintly heard voltaire has stood forth his opponent one might imagine such a writer to have had taste enough to relish his poetical beauties at least though possibly some doubt might arise about his sympathy with his moral ones but he unfairly tries him by pedant laws which our author either did not know or regarded not his compositions are a distinct species of the drama and not being an imitation of the greek one cannot be justly said to have infringed its rules shakespeare is a model not a copy he looked into nature not into books both for men and works it is learned ignorance therefore to quote the ancient exemplars against him is there no spring inspired but aganippes font no raptured vision but on parnassus mount the grecian bards themselves had conceived a more liberal notion in this particular who by making phoebus the god of poetry seem to have acknowledged inspiration to be universal  but as it may show more impartiality upon this subject to oppose one french authority to another i shall here quote against m voltaire the abbe le blancs opinion of our author in his letters on the english nation written to his friend he is says he of all writers ancient or modern the most of an original he is truly a great genius and nature has endowed him with powers to show it his imagination is rich and strong he paints whatever he sees and embellishes whatever he describes the loves in the train of venus are not represented with more grace in the pictures of albanus than this poet gives to those that attend on cleopatra in his description of the pomp with which that queen presents herself to mark antony on the banks of the cydnus  the reputation of this author is so great that i shall not be surprised if you suspect me of exaggeration in this account of him those of our nation who have ever mentioned him have been content to praise without being capable of judging sufficiently of his merits  to the further honor of our author be it said that a lady mrs motag of distinguished merit has lately appeared a champion in his cause against this minor critic this minute philosopher this fly upon a pillar of st pauls it was her example which has stirred up my emulation to this attempt for i own that i am ambitious of the honor of appearing to think at least though i despair of the success of writing like her  mr pope in the preface to his edition of this author says of all the english poets shakespeare must be confessed to be the fairest and fullest subject for criticism and to afford the most numerous as well as most conspicuous instances both of beauties and blemishes of all sorts and again i cannot however but mention some of his principal and characteristic excellencies for which notwithstanding his defects he is justly and deservedly elevated above all other dramatic writers  he might have added the following observation from longinus to his remarks who says that in reading homer plato or any other of the great geniuses of antiquity whenever we happen to meet with passages which appear to be unintelligible or absurd we ought fairly to conclude that were they alive to explain themselves in those places we should to our confusion be convinced that the ignorance or error lay in our own conceptions alone horace too may be referred to upon this occasion who indulgently says that the blaze of fine writing gilds over its blots such was the candor such the modesty and such the deference shown by ancient commentators to the works of literature or genius the brightness of the sun concealed its spots from them but secondhand critics to speak in the words of a modern author peer through a smoked glass to observe them  the learned and ingenious doctor johnson has given us a just and beautiful simile on this subject the works of a correct and regular writer says he is a garden accurately formed and diligently planted varied with shades and scented by flowers the composition of shakespeare is a forest in which oaks extend their branches and pines tower in the air interspersed sometimes with weeds and brambles and sometimes affording shelter to myrtles and roses filling the eye with awful pomp and gratifying the mind with endless diversity  this lastmentioned editor is the only one who has considered shakespeares writings in a moral light and therefore i confess myself of opinion that he has best understood them by thus pointing to their highest merit and noblest excellence and from several passages in the doctors preface particularly where he says that from his writings indeed a system of social duties may be selected for he who thinks reasonably must think morally as well as from frequent reflections of my own respecting the oeconomical conduct of life and manners which have always arisen in my mind on the perusal of shakespeares works i have ventured to assume the task of placing his ethic merits in a more conspicuous point of view than they have ever hitherto been presented in to the public  my difficulty will not be what to find but what to choose amidst such a profusion of sweets and variety of colors nay sometimes how to separate the moral from the matter in this authors writings which are often so contexted that to continue doctor johnsons allegory above quoted they may be compared to an intermixture of the physic with the kitchen garden where both food and medicine may be culled from the same spot  shakespeare is not only my poet but my philosopher also his anatomy of the human heart is delineated from nature not from metaphysics referring immediately to our intuitive sense and not wandering with the schoolmen through the pathless wilds of theory we not only see but feel his dissections just and scientific  the late ingenious lord lyttelton speaking of sakespeare says no author had ever so copious so bold so creative an imagination with so perfect a knowledge of the passions the humors and sentiments of mankind he painted all characters from heroes and kings down to innkeepers and peasants with equal truth and equal force if human nature were quite destroyed and no monument left of it except his works other beings might learn what man was from those writings dialogues of the dead  and ben johnson had long before said of him nature herself was proud of his designs and joyed to wear the dressings of his lines   shakespeare seems to possess that happy and peculiar kind of superiority over all other dramatic authors that the ancient poets and historians confessedly bear above the modern ones with regard to the genuine characters manners and sentiments of the persons exhibited in their respective writings in the first we see the men of nature in the latter but the children of the schools  the world at present is held more in trammels than it formerly was  from our modes of education policies and breeding our conduct and demeanor are become more sophisticate our minds less candid and our actions more disguised our modern literary painters represent us such as we appear but the genuine unadulterate heart can be moved by no affection allied by no sympathy with such factitious personages such puppets of polity such automata of modern refinement hence love friendship patriotism are long since become the obsolete sentiments of chivalry and romance but in all the representations of shakespeare we are sensible of a connection his whole dramatis personae seem to be our acquaintance and countrymen while in most other exhibitions they appear to be strangers and foreigners doctor johnson upon comparing the tragedy of cato with one of our authors plays says justly that addison speaks the language of poets but shakespeare that of men  doctor warburton says of all the literary exercitations of speculative men whether designed for the use or entertainment of the world there are none of so much importance or what are more of our immediate concern than those which let us into a knowledge of our nature others may exercise the reason or amuse the imagination but these only can improve the heart and form the mind to wisdom now in this science our shakespeare is confessed to occupy the foremost place whether we consider the amazing sagacity with which he investigates every hidden spring and wheel of human action or his happy manner of communicating this knowledge in the just and lively paintings which he has given us of all our passions appetites and pursuits these afford a lesson which can never be too often repeated or too strongly inculcated  shaftsbury though severe i think rather too much so against shakespeares faults allows that by the justness of his moral the aptness of his descriptions and the plain and natural turn of several of his characters he pleases his audience and gains their ear without a single bribe from luxury or vice  our authors poetical beauties have been already selected though they needed it not as they are undoubtedly so striking as scarcely to require the being particularly pointed out to any reader capable of conceiving or relishing them but a single line sometimes a word in many instances throughout his works may convey a hint or impress a sentiment upon the heart if properly marked which might possibly be overlooked while curiosity is attending to the fable or the imagination transported with the splendour of diction or sublimity of images  there is a moral sometimes couched in his fable which whenever i have been able to discover i have pointed out to the reader and from those pieces where this excellence is deficient in the argument as particularly in his historical plays where poetical justice cannot always obtain human life not being the whole of our existence i have given his moral and instruction in detail by quoting the passages as they happen to lie detached or referring to the scope and tenor of the dialogue  in these remarks and observations i have not restricted myself to morals purely ethic but have extended my observations and reflections to whatever has reference to the general economy of life and manners respecting prudence polity decency and decorum or relative to the tender affections and fond endearments of human nature more especially regarding those moral duties which are the truest source of mortal bliss  domestic ties offices and obligations  this code of morality has an advantage over any other of the kind on account of its not being conducted systematically in all books that treat upon these subjects the precepts are disposed methodically under separate heads or chapters as ambition bravery constancy devotion and so on to the end of the alphabet which mode though useful on account of references or as a commonplace book cannot be near so entertaining and consequently so well able to answer the utile dulci as a work of this sort where the documents rise out of the action immediately before our eyes and are constantly varying with the quick shifting of scenes person and subjects where love sometimes follows war jealousy succeeds friendship parsimony liberality

a savage and deformed slave women miranda daughter of prospero n b it is to be observed that in this and all the other dramatis personae i insert the names of those only whom i have brought upon the scene in the course of these remarks either as speaking themselves or being spoken to by others  the morality of shakespeares drama illustrated the tempest this play and the midsummer nights dream which in all the latter editions immediately follows it are considered by dr warburton as the noblest effort of that sublime and amazing imagination peculiar to shakespeare which soars above the bounds of nature without forsaking sense or more properly carries nature along with it beyond her terrestrial limits  he has indeed in both these exhibitions created beings out of all visible existence or as he has himself most beautifully expressed it given to airy nothing a local habitation and a name yet by the powers of his genius has he contrived to make these chimeras of his brain think act and speak in a manner which appears so suited to the anomalous personages his magic has conjured up that we readily adopt them into the scale of nature from a presumption that were they really to exist they would probably resemble the characters which his wand has endowed them with  these two plays are generally supposed to have been the first and second of his writing though i believe there are no dates remaining to confirm this opinion which can therefore be founded only on the idea that his youthful imagination must naturally be thought to have been more sportive and exuberant than his riper judgment might have permitted the indulgence of and here indeed she wantons as in her prime and plays at will her virgin fancies though if i may be allowed the liberty of a criticism about this matter i should be rather inclined to suppose this play to have been one of his latter performances as all the unities are so strictly preserved in it  but though both these pieces possess all the lesser merits of poesy they are not so much suited to the purpose of my present undertaking especially the second as several others of the same author for the most material events in both being principally conducted by machinery or supernatural agency produce rather astonishment than reflection so that unless we adopt dr johnsons remark in the first scene of the tempest it may be observed of gonzalo that being the only good man that appears with the king he is the only one who preserves his cheerfulness in the wreck or his hope on the island there is not so much to be collected from them as i could wish to be placed to the score of morality however all that can be extracted from either referrible to this head shall be diligently pointed out to the reader with this view i shall lay the fable of this play before my reader for the sake of the moral which may be so fairly deduced from it  prospero a duke of milan having been expelled his dominion by the usurpation of his brother anthonio confederated with alonzo a king of naples is committed to the mercy of the winds and waves in a rotten bark accompanied only by his daughter miranda a child of three years old but has had the good fortune to escape and be landed on an uninhabited island where the first scene is laid and the entire action continued during the whole representation  about twelve years after this event anthonio with alonzo ferdinand his son and other attendants being on a voyage together are driven out of their course by a storm and wrecked upon this island but escape alive on shore where the prince meeting with miranda falls in love with her and a reciprocal passion is conceived on her part also  prospero having thus got his enemies within his power on their repentance generously forgives them their cruelty and injustice recovers his dukedom again and the marriage of the lovers confirms an alliance on both sides  from this short story i think the following general moral will naturally result that the ways the justice and the goodness of providence are so frequently manifested toward mankind even in this life that it should ever encourage an honest and a guiltless mind to form hopes in the most forlorn situations and ought also to warn the wicked never to rest assured in the false confidence of wealth or power against the natural abhorrence of vice both in god and man  many of the unforeseen events of life which appear to us but accident or contingency may possibly be parts of the secret workings of providence all chance direction which we cannot see and have oftener been remarked rather as chastisements of vice than as reliefs from misery we are sensible in our own nature of a stronger impulse to resent the first than even to commiserate the latter how much higher then must this sentiment rise in the author of that very nature in wretchedness there is no contagion it is but particular and temporary the effects of vice are general and eternal  part of a speech in this play may be better quoted here than elsewhere as it refers so immediately to this subject  ariel speaking to the conspirators but remember for that is my business to you that you three from milan did supplant good prospero exposed unto the sea which has requit it him and his innocent child for which foul deed the powers delaying not forgetting have incensed the seas and shores yea all the creatures against your peace thee of thy son alonzo they have bereft and do pronounce by me lingering perdition worse than any death can be at once shall step by step attend you and your ways whose wrath to guard you from which here in this most desolate isle else falls upon your heads is nothing but hearts sorrow and a clear life ensuing act iii scene iv  let us now proceed to the particular maxims and sentiments which occur from the several parts of the dialogue  act i scene ii miranda speaking of the shipwreck thus expresses her sympathetic feelings for the wretched  o i have suffered with those that i saw suffer a brave vessel who had no doubt some noble creatures in her dashed all to pieces o the cry did knock against my very heart poor souls they perished had i been any god of power i would have sunk the sea within the earth or ere it should the good ship so have swallowed and the freighted souls within her there is something in the fond expression of good ship in the last line but one which strikes me with an idea of a peculiar tenderness in her compassion for the unhappy sufferers  prospero confessing the mad folly of trusting his reins of administration into other hands says the government i cast upon my brother and to my state grew stranger and again speaking of the same person being once perfected how to grant suits how to deny them whom to advance and whom to trash for overtopping new created the creatures that were mine i say or changed them or else new formed them having both the key of officer and office set all things in the state to what tune pleased his ear that now he was the ivy which had hid my princely trunk and sucked my verdure out on it in continuation and my trust like a good parent did beget of him a falsehood in its contrary as great as my trust was which had indeed no limit a confidence sans bound he being thus lorded not only with what my revenue yielded but what my power might else exact like one who having unto truth by telling often made such a sinner of his memory to credit his own lie he did believe he was indeed the duke from substitution and executing the outward face of royalty with all prerogative hence his ambition growing to have no screen between the part he played and him he played it for he needs will be absolute milan   in this account of the dukes weakness with the natural consequences attending it the poet has afforded a proper lesson to princes never to render themselves ciphers in their government by too dangerous a confidence in their favorites but ever to consider those persons to whom they depute the several offices of state as ministers in the literal sense of the word only not in the political one  when prospero describes the hazards and difficulties of his forlorn voyage miranda tenderly exclaims alack what trouble was i then to you to which he in a kind of ecstasy of fondness replies o a cherubim thou wast that did preserve me thou did smile infused with a fortitude from heaven when i have decked the sea with drops full salt under my burden groaned which raised in me an undergoing stomach to bear up against what should ensue   here the poet finely points to that virtue of true manhood which serves to strengthen our fortitude and double our activity when objects whom the ties of nature or the sympathy of affections have endeared to us require our solace or assistance in distress or danger while our cares centersolely in ourselves we are but one but become two where the heart is shared  prospero here in this island we arrived and here have thy schoolmaster made thee more profit than other princes can that have more time for vainer hours and tutors not so careful  here the too general dissipations of life are hinted at and those parents censured who transfer the pious duty of their childrens education to mercenary preceptors except in the meaner articles of it the arts exercises and sciences too few attend to the higher and more interesting charge of forming the mind and directing the heart to their proper objects and fewer still in deputing it to others seem to regard the chief requisites of character or capacity in those they entrust with this office looking upon competent scholarship to be alone sufficient  but a liberal education as far as it extends in colleges and schools does not always give a liberal mind and as example is allowed to exceed precept so do those sentiments and principles which we imbibe in youth from the living manners of our tutors grow with our growth and strengthen with our strength those only are capable of sinking into the heart and imbuing the mind while mere didactic maxims remain a load upon the memory alone the first only inspire us how to act the latter but instruct us how to speak  prospero and by my prescience i find my zenith does depend upon a most auspicious star whose influence if now i court not but omit my fortunes will ever after droop  this passage furnishes a prudent and necessary reflection to the mind of the reader that mans success in life often depends upon some lucky and critical occasion which suffered to slip by may never return again shakespeare expresses himself more fully on this subject in another place there is a tide in the affairs of men etc jul caes act iv scene    some other poet too presents us with a poetical image to the same purpose where he says that opportunity is bald behind post occasio calva   scene iii prospero to ariel do thou forget from what a torment i did free thee doctor johnson in a note upon this passage has given us the traditionary system of the hebrews relative to the fallen angels which has afforded me a hint that tempts me to consider the tenor of this scene in a more interesting light by observing upon the impatience of ariel a condemned spirit claiming under his servitude the promised redemption before he had fulfilled the commands of his master this allusion whether shakespeare intended it or no is so obvious that there would not require the alteration of a syllable to have it inserted among the mysteries ancient dramatic exhibitions so called usually performed by the priests in the   th and   th centuries upon public theaters in which the several dispensations of the gospel were profanely represented  men would be christians upon their own terms only and are too apt to think that faith and fear without love or works are sufficient for the purpose  act ii scene i gonzalo comforting and cheering up the spirits of his companions in the wreck speaks with a becoming resignation and proper gratitude toward providence beseech you sir be merry  you have cause so have we all of joy for our escape is much beyond our loss our hint of woe is common every day some sailors wife the master of some merchant and the merchant have just our theme of woe but for the miracle i mean our preservation few in millions can speak like us then wisely good sir weigh our sorrow with our comfort   an uncouth or severe manner of giving reproof or offering advice is very justly and with equal good sense and tenderness reflected upon by gonzalo in the following passage my lord sebastian the truth you speak does lack some gentleness and time to speak it in you rub the sore when you should bring the plaster   scene ii trinculo most humourously ridicules the passion of the english for strange sights in the following reflection on seeing caliban lying asleep on the ground whom he takes for a dead sea monster just cast ashore by the working of the waves were i in england now as once i was and had but this fish painted not a holy day fool there but would give a piece of silver there would this monster make a man any strange beast there makes a man when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar they will lay out ten to see a dead indian not however that this foible can fairly be induced against us as a national reflection by any means for it is not peculiar to this or any other particular people but will be found to be the common disposition and idle curiosity of mankind in general there is another piece of sarcasm also thrown out in the same speech as unjust as the former when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar no nation on the globe is more distinguished for charity humanity and benevolence than the english are at present and this must have been always their characteristic for manners may refine but cannot create virtues polishing may give taste but feelings come from nature  after trinculo has recovered from his fright and finds caliban to be but an harmless savage so very simple as to believe stephano to be the man in the moon he says by this good light this is a very shallow monster  i afraid of him a very shallow monster the man in the moon a most poor credulous monster  it is to be observed here that he was not charged with having been afraid nor did any one know of it but himself and it was this very consciousness that forced such a bravado from him this is doctor warburtons remark it is a just one and may be rendered general by observing that upon all occasions too prompt a defense of ourselves is a sort of selfaccusation  act iii scene i ferdinands first speech here prettily expresses that kind of cheerfulness with which a person undertakes labor or executes the meanest or most irksome offices for their secondself for those they love  there be some sports are painful but their labor delight in them sets off some kinds of baseness are nobly undergone and most poor matters point to rich ends this my mean task would be as heavy to me as it is odious but the mistress which i serve quickens what is dead and makes my labor pleasure  my sweet mistress weeps when she sees me work and says such baseness had never like executer i forget  but those sweet thoughts do even refresh my labor most busyless when i do it the above speech has something of the same turn and spirit in it with that of prospero in the second scene of the first act already observed upon  scene iv the horrors and upbraidings of a wounded conscience are finely painted in the latter part of this scene alonzo o it is monstrous monstrous methought the billows spoke and told me of it the winds did sing it to me and the thunder that deep and dreadful organpipe pronounced the name of prosper it did bass my trespass  gonzalo all three of them are desperate their great guilt like poison given to work a great time after now gins to bite the spirits    act iv scene i a chaste conduct between betrothed lovers is strongly urged and sanctified by severe maledictions and very natural predictions in the following passages prospero giving his daughter to ferdinand then as my gift and thine own acquisition worthily purchased take my daughter but if thou do break her virgin knot before all sanctimonious ceremonies may with full and holy rite be ministered no sweet aspersions shall the heavens let fall to make this contract grow but barren hate soureyed disdain and discord shall bestrew the union of your bed with weeds so loathly that you shall hate it both therefore take heed as hymens lamps shall light you  ferdinands reply  as i hope for quiet days fair issue and long life with such love as it is now the murkiest den the most opportune place and strongest suggestion our worser genius can shall never melt mine honor into lust to take away the edge of that days celebration when i shall think that phoebus steeds are foundered or night kept chained below  a little after old prospero being better acquainted with the fallibilities of human nature than the young lovers were repeats the same caution to ferdinand again look thou be true do not give dalliance too much the rein the strongest oaths are straw to the fire in the blood be more abstemious or else good night your vow to which ferdinand answers as before i warrant you sir the white cold virginsnow upon my heart abates the ardour of my liver   scene iv there is a beautiful but humiliating reflection on the inconsiderableness of life and grandeur made by prospero in this scene which is worthy of being added to the golden verses of pythagoras and ought to be placed in gilt characters as an inscription on all the palaces monuments or triumphal arches of the earth  our revels now are ended  these our actors as i foretold you were all spirits and are melted into air into thin air ether  and like the baseless fabric of this vision the cloudcapt towers the gorgeous palaces the solemn temples the great globe itself yea all which it inherit shall dissolve and like this unsubstantial pageant faded leave not a rack rack the most ratified part of a cloud detached from it and floating in an higher region behind we are such stuff as dreams are made of and our little life is rounded with a sleep act v scene i the feelings and sentiments of humanity with the nobleness of remission upon repentance are here finely and most affectingly touched  ariel to prospero the king his brother and yours abide all three distracted and the remainder mourning over them brimfull of sorrow and dismay but chiefly him that you termed the good old lord gonzalo his tears run down his beard like winter drops from eaves of reeds your charm so strongly works them that if you now beheld them your affections would become tender prospero do thou think so spirit  ariel mine would sir were i human  prospero and mine shall have thou which art but air a touch a feeling of their afflictions and shall not myself one of their ind that relish all as sharply passiond as they be kinlier moved than thou art though with their high wrongs i am struck to the quick yet with my nobler reason against my fury do i take part the rarer action is in virtue than in vengeance they being penitent the sole drift of my purpose does extend not a frown further go release them ariel my charms i will break their senses i will restore and they shall be themselves  this last passage closes the moral scene of the piece most beautifully in rising by degrees to the summit of all ethic and christian virtue humanity and forgiveness i shall therefore also conclude my remarks upon this performance with an allusion to a passage in horace where he draws a contrast between maevius and homer which is perfectly applicable to our author when compared with almost any other dramatic writer who has ever attempted the mavelous one with a flash begins and ends in smoke the other out of smoke brings glorious light and without raising expectation high surprises us with dazzling miracles roscommons translation of the art of poetry  a midsummer nights dream dramatis personae men theseus duke of athens lysander in love with hermia

in love with lysander helena in love with demetrius a midsummer nights dream i shall not trouble my readers with the fable of this piece as i can see no general moral that can be deduced from the argument nor as i hinted before preface to the tempest paragraph  th  is there much sentiment to be collected even from the dialogue but whatever harvest can be gleaned from this unfruitful field i shall endeavor to pick up as becomes a faithful steward of the farm  act i scene i theseus to hermia to you your father should be as a god one that composed your beauties yea and one to whom you are but as a form in wax by him imprinted and within his power to leave the figure or disfigure it in this speech the pious notion of the ancients with regard to this relation while genuine nature was their sole preceptor is fully expressed here the duty of children to their parents is indeed carried to the height and yet methinks not at all too far they are the objects of our earliest affections of our first deference of our primary obligations even superstition in this case as far at least as implicit obedience extends exceeds not true devotion  the decalogue was originally written on two tables five in each the first refers solely to religion the second to morality only to honor our parents therefore as falling within the former line of obligations is by this distinction made one of our pious duties as through them we honor the creator who ordained this relation between us this precept then should seem to have a double tie upon us as partaking both of piety and morals and therefore however the latter bond may chance to be cancelled the first ought never to be dispensed with  in fine there is something so fond and endearing in the idea and exercise of a childs obedience and deference toward a parent that how rotten must the root be or how blighted the branches if such a tree should fail of producing its natural fruit  thus far by way of general reflection only for i must notwithstanding admit that the particular instance of the daughters compliance exacted by the father in this piece of resigning an husband of her own choice upon equal terms and accepting another chosen arbitrarily for her by caprice merely was too severe a trial of obedience egeus here like abraham would sacrifice his child at the altar not only without the command of god but contrary to his express purpose proclaimed aloud by the voice of nature and further confirmed from the deductions of virtuous affection free will and rational election  when i said that the duty of a child was natural i did not mean to invest the parent with an authority which was not so and i cannot blame hermia therefore upon the severe laws of athens being declared to her for the chaste and spirited resolution she frames to herself on that occasion  so will i grow so live so die my lord ere i will yield my virgin patent up unto his lordship to whose unwished yoke my soul consents not to give sovereignty scene ii lysander the suitor elect of hermia here makes an observation upon the state of love which is too often verified in life that a sympathy of affections with other fitness of circumstances are seldom found to meet together so as to complete an happy union  lysander ah me for ought that ever i could read could ever hear by tale or history the course of true love never did run smooth but either it was different in blood  or else misgrafted in respect of years  or else it stood upon the choice of friends  or if there were a sympathy in choice war death or sickness did lay siege to it making it momentary as a sound swift as a shadow short as any dream brief as the lightning in the collied night that in a spleen spleen for a sudden or hasty fit unfolds both heaven and earth and ere a man has power to say behold the jaws of darkness do devour it up so quick bright things come to confusion  scene iii in this scene we are charmed with that mildness modesty and generous eulogium with which the fond and unhappy helena accosts a rival beauty and wooed by the man she loves  hermia god speed fair helena whither away  helena call you me fair that fair again unsay demetrius loves you fair  o happy fair your eyes are loadstars the polar star by which mariners are guided in their course  and your tongues sweet air more tuneable than lark to shepherds ear when wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear sickness is catching  oh were favor so yours would i catch fair hermia ere i go my ear should catch your voice my eye your eye my tongue should catch your tongues sweet melody were the world mine demetrius being bated the rest i would give to be to you translated  o teach me how you look and with what art you sway the motion of demetrius heart  hermia had used no arts no coquetry to allure her lover from her for as she expresses it just after in the same dialogue his folly helena is no fault of mine she had indeed happened to have done her an injury but no wrong and therefore the forsaken maid shows her justice in plaining her own ill fortune only without expressing the least manner of resentment against her unoffending rival  hermia in the same scene alludes to the magic power of love which concenters all our ideas in one making us prefer a cottage to a palace and a desert to a grove according to the situation or circumstances of the object of our affections after having declared the purpose of flying her country with her lover she adds before the time i did lysander see seemed athens like a paradise to me o then what graces in my love do dwell that he has turned a heaven into hell   and helena afterward carries on the same idea in the following lines things base and vile holding no quantity love can transpose to form and dignity love looks not with the eyes but with the mind and therefore is winged cupid painted blind nor has loves mind of any judgment taste wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste and therefore is love said to be a child because in choice he is so often beguiled   theseus too in a passage of his speech in the first scene of the fifth act of this play accords with the above sentiment while the lover all as frantic sees helens beauty in a brow of egypt   and shakespeare has hinted a moral on this latter subject with regard to irregular or illplaced affection as dr warburton has justly observed by as fine a metamorphosis as any in ovid in the last line of the following speech in the second scene of act the second the whole of which i shall transcribe here in order to show how justly and poetically he has pointed to the different effects of passion upon busy and contemplative minds as well as on idle and dissipated ones  oberon to puck that very time i saw but thou could not flying between the cold moon and the earth cupid all armed a certain aim he took at a fair vestal throned by the west this is meant as a compliment to queen elizabeth  and loosed his loveshaft smartly from his bow as it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts but i might see young cupids fiery shaft quenched in the chaste beams of the watery moon and the imperial votress passed on in maiden in ditation fancy free yet marked i where the bolt of cupid fell it fell upon a little western flower before milkwhite now purple with loves wound and maidens call it love in idleness act v scene i the deceptions of an enthusiastic or overheated fancy with the vain terrors of a dejected mind are well described in part of the following speech in which our author classes the lunatic the lover and the poet together and might have taken in the fanatic too along with them under the description of those who as he says in the first part of the same speech have such seething brains such shaping fantasies that apprehend more than cool reason ever comprehends theseus such tricks has strong imagination that if it would but apprehend some joy it comprehends some bringer of that joy or in the night imagining some fear how easy is a bush supposed a bear    among the brief of sports as it is called to be exhibited before theseus on his wedding day this is the title of one the thrice three muses mourning for the death of learning late deceased in beggary   mr warton imagines this passage to have alluded to a poem of spensers styled the tears of the muses on the neglect and contempt of learning in his time though this was not properly a complaint of that age only it has been so much the grievance of all times that it has long since obtained into a proverb as poor as a poet  the case of such unfortunate persons of those whom phoebus in his ire has blasted with poetic sire swift  is certainly very hard persons who apply their minds to letters must unavoidably neglect their temporal concerns and those who employ their time in the reformation or entertainment of the world should be supported by it  not by merely accidental and precarious emoluments but upon some more permanent foundation like the clergy who have had a provision made for them for the same reason as above and the name of clerk though now appropriated to the latter was formerly the common appellation of both the honor of such an establishment would be considerable to a state and the expense but small  for the numbers are but few  theseus expresses a just sentiment in a prince when philostrate the master of his revels objects to his being present at a play which the affections of the lowest rank of the athenian citizens had framed for the celebration of his nuptials  philostrate no my noble lord it is not for you i have heard it over and it is nothing nothing in the world unless you can find sport in their intents extremely stretched and conned with cruel pain to do you service  theseus i will hear that play for never any thing can be amiss when simpleness and duty tender it  hippolita also makes the same objection but from a motive of humanity only  i love not to see wretchedness oercharged and duty in his service perishing theseus why gentle sweet you shall see no such thing  hippolita he says they can do nothing in this kind  theseus the kinder we to give them thanks for nothing our sport shall be to take what they mistake and what poor duty cannot do noble respect takes not in might but merit where i have come great clerks have purposed to greet me with premeditated welcomes where i have seen them shiver and look pale make periods in the midst of sentences throttle their practiced accent in their fears and in conclusion dumbly have broke off not paying me a welcome trust me sweet out of their silence yet i picked a welcome and in the modesty of fearful duty i read as much as from the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious eloquence love therefore and tonguetied simplicity in least speaks most to my capacity  i must here conclude my observations on this play with the above beautiful passage as there does not appear to me to be any thing else in the remainder of it worthy to supply a reflection relative to the purposed scope or design of this work  postscript this play is perfectly picturesque and resembles some rich landscape where palaces and cottages huntsmen and husbandmen princes and peasants appear in the same scene together  the two gentlemen of verona dramatis personae men duke of milan father to silvia valentine the two gentlemen protheus the two gentlemen anthonio father to protheus panthion servant to anthonio women silvia the duke of milans daughter beloved of valentine julia a lady of verona beloved of protheus the two gentlemen of verona the fable of this play has no more moral in it than the former nor does it make us much amends either by the number or variety of its documents i would therefore have passed it by as some of the editors have done on the supposition of its not being one of shakespeares but that i thought any thing which had ever been imputed to that author had a right to claim a place in this work unless the rejection of it were established upon better grounds than the diversity of opinions about its authenticity among the commentators  and indeed were i to offer any doubt upon this point myself it should not be so much from the objections adduced by the editors as on account of the unnatural inconsistency of character in the person of protheus who in the first act and during above half the second appears to stand in the most amiable and virtuous lights both of morals and manhood as a fond lover and a faithful friend and yet suddenly belies his fair seemings by an infidelity toward the first object and a treachery with regard to the second it is true indeed that in the latter end he expresses a sort of contrition for his crimes but yet this still seems to remain equivocal as it does not appear to have arisen from any remorse of conscience or abhorrence of his baseness but rather from a disappointment in his pursuit and an open detection of his villainy  there are but few instances of this kind that i remember to have met with throughout the drama of shakespeare for however he may sport as he often does with the three unities of aristotle time place and action he seldom sins against a fourth which i am surprised the critics have not added as being worth them all  namely that of character the tenor of which is generally preserved from first to last in all his works this consistency is required in the epic and why not insisted on in the dramatic poem i cannot conceive  i am venturing i own beyond my purpose but i am tempted here upon mentioning his breach of the unities to observe that the commentators do our author great injustice to examine him by the cold rules of artful construction shakespeares writings resemble the ancient music which consisted in melody alone without regard to harmony which is a science of much later invention and it has been remarked that the original airs of every country which charm a natural ear most have been those that give offense to modern composers by an utter neglect of the counterpoint the compositions of our bard have the same beauty with the same defect he ought therefore never to be considered but under the description which milton has given of him our sweetest shakespeare fancys child warbling his native woodnotes wild would they restrain him within the precincts of art the height the depth of whose imagination and creative genius found even the extent of nature too straightly bounded for it to move in  exhausted worlds and then imagined new like an eastern monarch his word was law his will and pleasure edicts and decrees but there are certain mechanists in criticism who have no other way of judging but by applying the rule and compass like ancient gardeners who trimmed their foresttrees into cones and cylinders and reduced winding brooks to square canals a man must be born a critic as well as a poet but at this rate he may be bred both  but to return from this digression to the subject which lies more properly before us at present  act i scene i the great necessity and benefit of travel are properly recommended and marked by apt phrase in the first speech here which opening with the addition of a few other passages seems to promise more than i am sorry to say the rest of the piece is responsible for and it is this circumstance which has induced the critics to suspect this play not to have been originally one of shakespeares but only revised and enriched with fragments by him as it may be deemed to be not a jewel but only a lump of paste set round with sparks  valentine cease to persuade my loving protheus homekeeping youth have ever homely wits  were it not affection chains thy tender days to the sweet glances of thy honored love i rather would entreat thy company to see the wonders of the world abroad than living dully sluggaraized at home wear out thy youth in shapeless idleness forming neither manners nor character   the tenderness and solicitudes of friendship are well and fondly expressed in the reply protheus will thou be gone sweet valentine adieu  think on thy protheus when thou happily see some rare noteworthy object in thy travel  wish me partaker in thy happiness when thou do meet good hap and in thy danger if ever danger do environ thee commend thy grievance to my holy prayer for i will be thy beadsman valentine    if ever danger do environ thee  this line strikes me with a peculiar beauty protheus desires to be considered as a sharer in his friends weal or woe during absence the first he mentions without any reserve wish me partaker in thy happiness when thou do meet good hap  but when he comes to speak of the latter he appears to catch himself up as if alarmed even at the idea of his danger and seems to have begun his prayers for him already  but not to quit the first subject hinted above only to reassume it again i shall introduce a speech from the fourth scene following though somewhat out of its place here where panthion speaking to the father of protheus tells him the opinion of another person about him and his son  panthion he wondered that your lordship would suffer him to spend his life at home while other men of slender reputation put forth their sons to seek preferment out some to the wars to try their fortunes there some to discover islands far away some to the studious universities for any or for all these exercises he said that protheus your son was meet and did request me to importune you to let him spend his time no more at home which would be great impeachment to his age in having known no travel in his youth  anthony nor needst thou much importune me to that whereon this month i have been hammering i have considered well his loss of time and how he cannot be a perfect man not being tried and tutored in the world experience is by industry achieved and perfected by the swift would not show be a fitter word in this plae course of time  but to return to the first scene again in this and many of the subsequent ones the several parts of which shall be quoted as they follow in order to prevent the interruption of the subject our author has truly described the nature the effects the anxieties the weaknesses the extravagancies and the miseries of the passion of love most philosophically poetically and experimentally  valentine persuading protheus to quit his mistress and accompany him on his travels says to be in love where scorn is bought with groans coy looks with heartsore sighs one fading moments mirth with twenty watchful weary tedious nights  if happily won perhaps an hapless gain if lost why then a grievous labor won however but a folly bought with wit or else a wit by folly vanquished love is your master for he masters you and he that is so yoked by a fool methinks should not be chronicled for wise protheus yet writers say as in the sweetest bud the eating canker dwells so eating love inhabits in the finest wits of all  valentine and writers say as the most forward bud is eaten by the canker ere it blows even so by love the young and tender wit is turned to folly blasting in the bud losing his verdure even in the prime and all the fair effects of future hopes protheus alone he after honor hunts i after love he leaves his friends to dignify them more i leave myself my friends and all for love thou julia thou have metamorphosed me made me neglect my studies lose my time war with good counsel set the world at naught make wit with musing weak heart sick with thought    valentine after his falling in love to protheus i have done penance for contemning love those high imperious thoughts have punished me with bitter fasts with penitential groans with nightly tears and daily heartsore sighs  for in revenge of my contempt of love love has chaced sleep from my enthralled eyes and made them watchers of my own hearts sorrow o gentle protheus loves a mighty lord and has so humbled me as i confess there is no woe to his correction nor to his service no such joy on earth now no discourse except it be of love now can i break my fast dine sup and sleep upon the very naked name of love call her divine  scene vii julia and lucetta a true devoted pilgrim is not weary to measure kingdoms with his feeble steps much less shall she who has loves wings to fly oh know thou not his looks are my souls food pity the dearth that i have pined in by longing for that food so long a time did thou but know the inly touch of love thou would as soon go kindle fire with snow as seek to quench the fire of love with words  lucetta i do not seek to quench your loves hot fire but qualify the fires extreme rage lest it should burn above the bounds of reason  julia the more thou dammst it up the more it burns  the current that with gentle murmur glides thou know being stopped impatiently does rage but when his fair course is not hindered he makes sweet music with the enamelled stones giving a gentle kiss to every sedge he overtaketh in his pilgrimage  and so by many winding nooks he strays with willing sport to the wide ocean  scene x  there are two other passages in this play which i have not included among the above number of quotations because though they relate to the same subject yet not falling within the description of the passion but the artful or sinister conduct of it only i have reserved to a place by themselves  the first is where valentine replies to the duke who asks his advice how to gain a coy mistress  win her with gifts if she respect not words dumb jewels often in their silent kind more than quick words do move a womans mind act iii scene ii the second is in the fifth scene following the above where the most effectual but basest method for curing a womans love that can be devised is there pointed out duke to protheus what might we do to make the girl forget the love of valentine and love sir thurio  protheus the best way is to slander valentine with falsehood cowardice and poor descent three things that women highly hold in hate  duke ay but she will think that it is spoke in hate  protheus true if his enemy deliver it therefore it must with circumstance be spoken by one whom she esteems as his friend    act v scene iv in the first speech here valentine makes a reflection which cannot be too often marked to us upon the powerful effect of use or habit over the mind of man second nature is more than a match even for the first in this philosophy lie the manifest and manifold advantages of a good education which alone forms the different manners allotted to the sexes rendering men brave and preserving women chaste exchange but the point of honor between them and you fill the world with amazons and dastards  how use does breed a habit in a man this shadowy desert unfrequented woods i better brook than flourishing peopled towns here can i sit alone unseen of any and to the nightingales complaining notes tune my distresses and record my woes in the same scene he expresses himself most affectingly upon discovering the faithlessness of his friend and displays a noble and a generous nature in his ready forgiveness on the others as prompt penitence  thou treacherous man thou have beguiled my hopes naught but mine eye could have persuaded me  now i dare not say i have one friend alive  thou would disprove me who should be trusted when ones own right hand is perjured to the bosom protheus i am sorry i must never trust thee more but count the world a stranger for thy sake the private wound is deepest oh time accursed amongst all foes that a friend should be the worst protheus my shame and guilt confound me  forgive me valentine if hearty sorrow be a sufficient ransom for offense i tender it here i do as truly suffer as ever i did commit  valentine then i am paid and once again i do receive thee honest who by repentance is not satisfied is nor of heaven nor earth  scene v and lost the duke now by the honor of my ancestry i do applaud thy spirit valentine and think thee worthy of an empress love know then i here forget all former griefs cancel all grudge repeal thee home again plead a new state in thy unrivalled merit to which i thus subscribe  sir valentine thou art a gentleman and well derived take thou thy silvia for thou have deserved her  in this passage valentine is justly commended f his proper and becoming manhood in vindicatin the right both of his love and honor at the hazar of his comparatively meaner life he has therefore a right to the appellation and character here given o him in the following line thou art a gentleman and well derived  but what strikes me more particularly in this speech is the gallant dukes asseveration in that truly noble expression now by the honor of my ancestry it was this generous spirited idea that continued down the race of heroes among us while they did exist and were the profession of heraldry never to be considered in any other light than as a record of mens worth not titles it would then become both a political and a liberal science honors as seldom says should be native only and not dative derived from merits not from gifts  measure for measure dramatis personae men duke of vienna angelo lord deputy in the dukes absence escalus an ancient lord joined with him claudio a young gentleman lucio his friend women isabella sister to claudio juliet with child by claudio measure for measure i cannot see what moral can be extracted from the fable of this piece but as the author of it seems to have thought otherwise i shall present the reader with his idea on this subject in his own words where the duke passes sentence on angelo his deputy for his double villainy haste still pays haste and leisure answers leisure like does quit like and measure still for measure act v scene vii  but as there is not matter enough here for further expatiating upon i shall proceed to collect together the dispersed maxims sentiments or morals which may be gathered from the field at large and which i shall arrange under their several heads without regard to the order of the drama as this method may best serve to give them an united force and enable them to act more strongly on the minds of my readers  act i scene ii that our talents our faculties or powers are not our own properly but that we are to consider ourselves as endowed with such advantages by providence for the more enlarged benefit of mankind is finely set forth in the following speech duke angelo there is a kind of character in thy life doctor johnson reads look and i think rightly  that to the observer does thy history fully unfold thyself and thy belongings are not thine own so proper as to waste thyself upon thy virtues them on thee heaven does with us as we with torches do not light them for themselves for if our virtues did not go forth of us twere all alike as if we had them not paulum sepultae distat inertiae celta virtus hor   spirits are not finely touched but to fine issues nor nature never lends the smallest scruple of her excellence but like a thrifty goddess she determines herself the glory of a creditor both thanks and use    the dangers to be apprehended to society from those who affect too much popularity are very justly remarked upon in the same scene which judgment may be fully supported by innumerable instances of demagogues to be met with in history both ancient and modern  duke i love the people but do not like to stage me to their eyes though it do well i do not relish well their loud applause and aves vehement nor do i think the man of safe discretion that does affect it  scene vi that a spirit of liberty where the reins of government are suffered to relax is too apt to exceed into a licentiousness which counteracts its own ends is well noted here  lucio on seeing his friend carrying to prison why how now claudio whence comes this restraint claudio from too much liberty my lucio liberty as surfeit is the father of much fast so every scope by the immoderate use turns to restraint our natures do pursue like rats that raven down their proper bane a thirsty evil and when we drink we die  again in the next scene duke we have strict statutes and most biting laws the needful bits and curbs for headstrong steeds which for these nineteen years we have let sleep even like an oergrown lion in a cave that goes not out to prey now as fond fathers having bound up the threatening twigs of birch only to stick it in their childrens sight for terror not to use in time the rod becomes more mocked than feared so our decrees dead to infliction to themselves are dead and liberty plucks justice by the nose the baby beats the nurse and quite athwart goes all decorum    and just after condemning his own neglect in suffering the people to take such scope he carries his censure against himself so far as even to say that he had encouraged them to do so for we bid this be done when evil deeds have their permissive pass and not the punishment   the same reflection is carried on in the fifth scene of the second act where some one says lord angelo is severe to which escalus his colleague in administration replies it is but needful mercy is not itself that often looks so pardon is still the nurse of second woe   but to recur back again to the first act which i quitted in pursuit of the above argument started there in the sixth scene where claudio desires his friend to employ his sister to solicit his pardon he very judiciously urges that peculiar kind of persuasiveness which naturally dwells in youth and innocence acquaint her with the danger of my state implore her in my voice that she make friends to the strict deputy bid herself assay him i have great hope in that for in her youth there is a prone doctor johnson reads power or prompt either of which epithets would certainly render this passage more intelligible i prefer the latter expression and speechless dialect such as moves men   and again in the last scene of this first act lucio says to isabella go to lord angelo and let him learn to know when maidens foe men give like gods but when they weep and kneel all their petitions are as truly theirs as they themselves would owe them   in the same scene the nature and danger of irresolution is well described  lucio our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we often might win by fearing to attempt  act ii scene i the political arguments for justice with the humane motives for mercy are finely contrasted here between the two deputies of the state angelo we must not make a scarecrow of the law setting it up to fear the birds of prey and let it keep one shape till custom makes it their perch and not their terror  escalus ay but yet let us be keen and rather cut a little than fall and bruise to death let but your honor know whom i believe to be most strait in virtue that in the working of your own affections had time cohered with place or place with wishing or that the resolute acting of your blood could have attained the effect of your own purpose whether you had not sometime in your life erred in this point which now you censure him and pulled the law upon you  angelo it is one thing to be tempted escalus another thing to fall i not deny the jury passing on the prisoners life may in the sworn twelve have a thief or two guiltier than him they try what is open made to justice that justice seizes on what know the laws that thieves do pass on thieves it is very pregnant the jewel that we find we stoop and take it because we see it but what we do not see we tread upon and never think of it you may not so extenuate his offense for i have had such faults but rather tell me when i that censure him do so offend let mine own judgment pattern out my death and nothing come in partial sir he must die  escalus well heaven forgive him and forgive us all some rise by sin and some by virtue fall some run through brakes of ice and answer none and some condemned for a fault alone    scene vii we find the same subjects continued here with additional spirit and beauty  isabella to angelo i have a brother is condemned to die  i do beseech you let it be his fault and not my brother angelo condemn the fault and not the actor of it why every faults condemned ere it be done mine were the very cipher of a function to find the faults whose fine stands in the record and let go by the actor  isabella o just but severe law must he needs die   angelo maiden no remedy   isabella yes i do think that you might pardon him and neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy  angelo i will not do it   isabella but can you if you would   angelo look what i will not ought not i should think to be a more proper expression here  that i cannot do   isabella but might you do it and do the world no wrong if so your heart were touched with that remorse as mine is to him  angelo he is sentenced it is too late   isabella too late why no i that do speak a word may call it back again well believe this no ceremony that to great ones longs not the kings crown nor the deputed sword the marshals truncheon nor the judges robe become them with one half so good a grace as mercy does if he had been as you and you as he you would have slipped like him but he like you would not have been so stern  angelo pray you be gone   isabella i would to heaven i had your potency and you were isabel should it then be thus no  i would tell what twere to be a judge and what a prisoner  angelo your brother is a forfeit of the law and you but waste your words  isabella alas alas why all the souls that were doctor warburton has changed were to are because he says the expression in the text is false divinity i tremble at venturing to differ from so learned a judge in matters of theology but are we not taught that the redemption had released the forfeit we were then brought within the pale at least of salvation which the orthodoxy says we were not before and a second forfeit i should therefore suppose to be the consequence of our own transgression not that of our first parents  were forfeit once and be that might the vantage best have took found out the remedy how would you be if he which is the top of judgment should but judge you as you are oh think on that and mercy then will breathe within your lips like man new made  angelo be you content fair maid it is the law not i condemns your brother were he my kinsman brother or my son it should be thus with him he dies tomorrow  isabella tomorrow oh that is sudden spare him spare him he is not prepared for death even for our kitchens we kill the fowl of season shall we serve heaven with less respect than we do minister to our gross selves good good my lord bethink you who is it that has died for this offense there is many have committed it  angelo the law has not been dead though it has slept  those many had not dared to do that evil if the first man that did the edict infringe had answered for his deed now it is awake takes note of what is done and like a prophet looks in a glass that shows what future evils or new or by remissness new conceived and so in progress to be hatched and born are now to have no successive degrees but ere they live to end  isabella yet show some pity   angelo i show it most of all when i show justice for then i pity those i do not know which a dismissed offense would after gall and do him right that answering one soul wrong lives not to act an other be satisfied your brother dies  tomorrow  isabella oh it is excellent to have a giants strength but it is tyrannous to use it like a giant could great men thunder as jove himself does jove would never be quiet for every pelting petty officer would use his heaven for thunder nothing but thunder  merciful heaven thou rather with thy sharp and sulfurous bolt splittest the unwedgeable and gnarled oak than the soft myrtle  o but man proud man dressed in a little brief authority most ignorant of what he is most assured his glassy essence like an angry ape plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven as make the angels weep who with our spleens would all themselves laugh mortal we cannot weigh our brother with yourself great men may jest with saints it is wit in them but in the less foul profanation that in the captains but a choleric word which in the soldier is flat blasphemy  angelo why do you put these sayings upon me   isabella because authority though it err like others has yet a kind of medicine in itself that skins the vice of the top go to your bosom knock there and ask your heart what it does know that is like my brothers fault if it confess a natural guiltiness such as his is let it not sound a thought upon your tongue against my brothers life  angelo  aside she speaks and it is such sense that my sense breeds with it  to isabel fare you well  isabella gentle my lord turn back   angelo i will bethink me  come again tomorrow   isabella hark how i will bribe you  good my lord turn back   angelo how bribe me   isabella ay with such gifts that heaven shall share with you not with fond shekele of the tested gold or stones whose rates are either rich or poor as fancy values them but with true prayers that shall be up at heaven and enter there ere funrise prayers from preserved souls from fasting maids whose minds are delicate to nothing temporal  i have transcribed perhaps more of this dialogue than may be thought strictly relative to the arguments of it but i found it impossible to break off before and i believe the reader would be sorry to have had me interrupt it sooner  scene viii the powerful attractions of virtue and modesty are finely shown in angelos conflict and reflections here isabella having in the last scene received some hope of pardon for her brother takes leave of the deputy with this expression save your honor angelo solus from thee even from thy virtue  what is this what is this is this her fault or mine the tempter or the tempted who sins most not she  nor does she tempt  but it is i that lying by the violet in the sun do as the carrion does not as the flower corrupt with virtuous season can it be that modesty may more betray our sense than womans lightness having waste ground enough shall we desire to raze the sanctuary and pitch our evils there oh fie fie fie what do thou or what art thou angelo do thou desire her foully for those things that make her good oh let her brother live  thieves for their robbery have authority when judges steal themselves what do i love her that i desire to hear her speak again and feast upon her eyes what is it i dream on oh cunning enemy that to catch a saint with saints do bait thy hook most dangerous is that temptation that does goad us on to sin in loving virtue never could the strumpet with all her double vigor art and nature once stir my temper but this virtuous maid subdues me quite ever till this very now when men were fond i smiled and wondered how   scene ix the duke here under the character of a friar in confessing juliet gives an admirable lesson on the nature of contrition distinguishing it very properly from attrition merely and at the same time expresses a just but severe sentence against a womans failure in the point of chastity their education their manners and the moral consequences of their frailty throwing so many more bars in their way than the modes of the world have opposed to the other sex  duke to juliet repent you fair one of the sin you carry juliet i do and bear the shame most patiently  duke i will teach you how you shall arraign your conscience and try your penitence if it be found or hollowly put on  juliet i will gladly learn  duke love you the man that wronged you  juliet yes as i love the woman that wronged him  duke so then it seems your most offenceful act was mutually committed  juliet mutually  duke then was your sin of heavier kind than his  juliet i do confess it and repent it father  duke it is meet so daughter  but repent you not as that the sin has brought you to this shame which sorrows always toward ourselves not heaven showing wed not sek heaven as we love it but as we stand in fear  juliet i do repent me as it is an evil  duke there rest  scene x the frailty of human nature is well described in the wanderings of the mind in prayer and the struggle between virtue and passion in the first speech here which concludes with observing how apt the pageantry or false seemings of power are to impose on the world even the great vulgar as well as the small  angelo solus when i would pray and think i think and pray to several subjects heaven has my empty words whilst my intention hearing not my tongue anchors on isabel heavens in my mouth as if i did but only chew its name and in my heart the strong and swelling evil of my conception the state whereon i studied is like a good thing being often read grown feared and tedious yea my gravity wherein let no man hear me i take pride could i with boot change for an idle plume which the air beats for vain oh place oh form how often do thou with thy case thy habit wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls to thy false seeming blood thou art but blood let us write good angel on the devils horn it is yet doctor johnsons reading instead of it is not the devils crest scene xi there is a proper sentiment of christian humility expressed by isabella in this place let me be ignorant and in nothing good but graciously to know i am no better   and just after there is a virtuous argument finely supported by her against the insidious pleadings of the deputy who after refusing her a pardon for her brother thus proceeds angelo admit no other way to save his life as i subscribe not that nor any other but in the loss doctor johnson more properly reads toss for canvas of the question of question that you his sister finding yourself desired of such a person whose credit with the judge or own great place could fetch your brother from the manacles of the allbinding law and that there were no earthly mean to save him but that either you must lay down the treasures of your body to this supposed or else let him suffer what would you do  isabella as much for my poor brother as myself  that is were i under the terms of death the impression of keen whips i would wear as rubies and strip myself to death as to a bed that longing i have been sick for ere i would yield my body up to shame  angelo then must your brother die  isabella and twere the cheaper way better it were a brother died for once than that a sister by redeeming him should die for ever  angelo were not you then as cruel as the sentence that you have slandered so  isabella ignominy in ransom and free pardon are of two houses lawful mercy sure is nothing kin to foul redempon    act iii scene i the duke remaining still under the disguise of a friar comes to the prison to prepare claudio for death upon which subject he makes a number of moral and philosophic reflections but these last mostly of the stoic kind by observing on the precariousness and insignificancy of human life the whole of which i shall give here at full length  duke to claudio be absolute for death or death or life shall thereby be the sweeter reason thus with life if i do lose thee i do lose a thing that none but fools would keep a breath thou art servile to all the skiey influences that do this habitation where thou keepst hourly afflict merely thou art deaths fool for him thou labourst by thy flight to shun and yet runnst toward him still thou art not noble for all the accommodations that thou bear are nursed by baseness you are by no means valiant for thou do fear the soft and tender fork of a poor worm thy best of rest is sleep and that thou often provokst yet grossly fear thy death which is no more you are not thyself for thou existst on many a thousand grains that issue out of dust happy thou art not for what thou have not that thou strivst to get and what thou have forgetst thou art not certain for thy complexion shifts to strange effects dr johnson reads affects and with good reason  after the moon if you are rich you are poor for like an ass whose back with ingots bows thou bear thy heavy riches but a journey and death unloadeth thee friend have thou none for thy own bowels which do call thee sire the mere effusion of thy proper loins do curse the gout serpigo and the rheum for ending thee no sooner thou have nor youth nor age but as it were an afterdinners sleep dreaming on both for all thy blasted the doctor also reads blasted instead of blessed youth becomes as aged and does beg the alms of palsied eld and when you are old and rich thou have nor heat affection limb or beauty to make thy riches pleasant what is yet in this that bears the name of life yet in this life lie hid more than a thousand deaths yet death we fear that makes these odds all even and in the next scene isabella after hinting to her brother at certain base conditions on which his sentence might be remitted endeavors to strengthen his resolution to prefer death before dishonor by somewhat of the same manner of reasoning as above but more conclusive and concise oh i do fear thee claudio and i quake lest thou a feverish life should entertain and six or seven winters more respect than a perpetual honor dare thou die the sense of death is most in apprehension and the poor beetle that we tread upon in corporal sufferance finds a pang as great as when a giant dies   to this suspicion of his weakness he replies with the spirit becoming a man of honor and virtue claudio why give you me this shame think you i can a resolution fetch from flowery tenderness if i must die i will encounter darkness as a bride and hug it in my arms    but after having paid this compliment to heroism human nature comes in for its share in turn and he then pleads for life even on the most abject terms claudio oh isabel   isabella what says my brother   claudio deaths a fearful thing   isabella and shamed life a hateful   claudio ay but to die and go we know not where to lie in cold obstruction and to rot this sensible warm motion to become a kneaded clod and the delinquent instead of delighted johnson spirit to bathe in fiery floods or to reside in thrilling regions of thickribbed ice to be imprisoned in the viewless winds and blown with restless violence round about the pendant world or to be worse than worst of those that lawless and uncertain thoughts imagine howling it is too horrible the weariest and most loathed worldly life that age ach penury and imprisonment can lay on nature is a paradise to what we fear of death    what an ignoble sentiment is here expressed in the four last lines of this speech and yet the great maecenas had the same and declared it very nearly in the same words what a disgrace to letters but history describes him to have been a person of foppish and effeminate manners and it is but rarely that the outward character belies the inward one  isabellas indignation against her brother on this occasion though it has no relation to the subjects we are upon yet as it may have an effect in raising the same resentment against vice and meanness in the minds of my readers i think it worthy to be inserted here isabella oh you beast oh faithless coward oh dishonest wretch will thou be made a man out of my vice is it not a kind of incest to take life from thine own sisters shame what should i think heaven grant my mother played my father fair for such a warped slip of wilderness never issued from his blood  take my defiance  die perish might my only bending down reprieve thee from thy fate it should proceed oh fie fie fie thy sins not accidental but a trade mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd twere best that thou die quickly    scene vi in the last speech of this scene our author gives us a shocking but too just description of slander duke no might nor greatness in mortality can censure scape  backwounding calumny the whitest virtue strikes what king so strong can tie the gall up in the slandering tongue    act iv scene iii in the last passage of this scene the duke repeats the same reflection in still stronger terms o place and greatness millions of false eyes are stuck upon thee volumes of report run with these false and most contrarious quests upon thy doings  thousand escapes of wit make thee the father of their idle dreams and rack thee in their fancies   such has been the complaint of all ages even when the scandal was merely oral but how much more intolerable has the offense become of late years when obloquy is not only privately spoken but publicly printed and openly circulated throughout these kingdoms the freedom of the press should be ever held sacred among us it is our palladium but surely to restrain its licentiousness can no more hurt the liberty of it than the chastisement of felony can be said to injure the liberty of the subject  scene x when isabella upon a supposition of her brothers death curses angelo for his perfidy the duke reproves her in the following words this nor hurts him nor profits you a jot forbear it therefore give your cause to heaven   shakespeare seems to have wound up the several morals of his characters and dialogue in this place with an excellent christian document against the rage of malediction and the passion of revenge for we find little more in the remainder of it sufficiently worthy of continuing any further remarks on the piece  postscript in number     of the spectator there is a parallel story with this of angelo related though not in every circumstance the same of rhynsault governor of zealand under charles the bald duke of burgundy which may amuse the reader to recur to after reading this play  the merchant of venice dramatis personae men morochius a moorish prince prince of arragon anthonio the merchant of venice bassanio his friend salanio friends to anthonio and bassanio solarino friends to anthonio and bassanio gratiano friends to anthonio and bassanio lorenzo in love with jessica shylock a jew lancelot servant to the jew women portia an heiress nerissa her maid jessica the jews daughter the merchant of venice i shall take no further notice of the want of a moral fable in the rest of these plays but shall proceed to observe upon the characters and dialogue without interruption for the future  act i scene i the forebodings or presentiments of evil natural to the human mind are strongly pointed at here it were in vain to attempt the investigation of this matter from philosophy any more than that of prophetic dreams so that all we have to do is simply to acquiesce in the fact itself which repeated experience has sufficiently vouched in too many remarkable instances to be imputed to common casualty  anthonio solarino and salanio anthonio in sooth i know not why i am so sad it wearies me you say it wearies you but how i caught it found it or came by it what stuff it is made of whereof it is born i am to learn   upon which his two friends attempt to account for this impression on his mind in a very natural manner  as where a mans treasure is there will his heart be also  salanio your mind is tossing on the ocean there where your argofies with portly sail like signiors and rich burghers on the flood or as it were the pageants of the sea do overpeer the petty traffickers that curtsie to them do them reverence as they fly by them with their woven wings  solarino believe me sir had i such venture forth the better part of my affections would be with my hopes abroad i should be still plucking the grass to throw up into the air  to know where sits the wind peering in maps for ports and piers and roads and every object that might make me fear misfortune to my ventures out of doubt would make me sad  salanio my wind cooling my broth would blow me to an ague when i thought what harm a wind too great might do at sea i should not see the sandy hourglass run but i should think of shallows and of flats and see my wealthy andrew docked in sand vailing her high top lower than her ribs to kiss her burial should i go to church and see the holy edifice of stone and not bethink me strait of dangerous rocks which touching but my gentle vessels side would scatter all the spices on the stream enrobe the roaring waters with my silks and in a word but even now worth this and now worth nothing shall i have the thought to think on this and shall i lack the thought that such a thing bechanced would make me sad but tell not me  i know anthonio is sad to think upon his merchandise  but when he denies that any reflection upon the state of his fortune or that even the passion of love has wrought this grave effect upon his spirits they then remain quite at a loss to account farther for it referring it merely to the peculiarity of his character or particular complexion of mind which is described and contrasted with one of an opposite cast with admirable humor solarino not in love neither then let us say youre sad because you are not merry and twere as easy for you to laugh and leap and say youre merry because you are not sad now by twoheaded janus nature has framed strange fellows in her time some that will evermore peep through their eyes and laugh like parrots at a bag piper and others of such vinegar aspect that they will not show their teeth in way of smile though nestor swear the jest be laughable    gratiano then coming in and taking notice of the seriousness of anthonios aspect alike imputes it to the same cause his other friends had done you look not well signior anthonio you have too much respect upon the world they lose it that do buy it with much care believe me you are marvellously changed   to which he replies i hold the world but as the world gratiano a stage where every man must play his part and mine a sad one   upon this gratiano enters into the same humorous description of the different characters of men as solarino had done  let me play the fool with mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come and let my liver rather heat with wine than my heart cool with mortifying groans why should a man whose blood is warm within sit like his grandfire cut in alabaster sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice by being peevish i tell thee what anthonio i love thee and it is my love that speaks there are a sort of men whose visages do cream and mantle like a standing pool and do a wilful stillness entertain with purpose to be dressed in an opinion of wisdom gravity profound conceit as who should say i am sir oracle and when i open my lips let no dog bark o my anthonio i do know of those that therefore only are reputed wise for saying nothing who i am very sure if they should speak would almost damn those ears which hearing them would call their brothers fools alluding to the scripture text he that calls his brother a fool etc  but fish not with this melancholy bait for this fools gudgeon this opinion another very common character in life is also described in the same scene though i think not fairly applicable to the person who was capable of making the speech above cited bassanio gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing more than any man in all venice his reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff you may seek all day ere you find them and when you have them they are not worth the search     in the following passage of the same scene there is a warmth of affection and generous friendship fondly and beautifully expressed  bassanio and anthonio bassanio to you anthonio i owe the most in money and in love and from your love i have a warranty to unburden all my plots and purposes how to get clear of all the debts i owe  anthonio i pray you good bassanio let me know it and if it stand as you yourself still do within the eye of honor be assured my purse my person my extremest means lie all unlocked to your occasions you know me well and herein spend but time to wind about my love with circumstance and out of doubt you do me now more wrong in making question of my uttermost than if you had made waste of all i have then do but say to me what i should do that in your knowledge may by me be done and i am pressed unto it  therefore speak thou know that all my fortunes are at sea nor have i money nor commodity to raise a present sum therefore go forth try what my credit can in venice do that shall be racked even to the uttermost to furnish thee to belmont to fair portia go presently inquire and so will i where money is and i no question make to have it of my trust or for my sake  again in the third scene of act the third the same noble spirit is carried on  portia and bassanio portia is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble  bassanio the dearest friend to me the kindest man the best conditioned  an unwearied spirit in doing courtesies and one in whom the ancient roman honor more appears than any that draws breath in italy  portia what sum owes e the jew  bassanio for me three thousand ducats  portia what no more pay him six thousand and deface the bond double six thousand and then treble that before a friend of this description shall lose a hair through my bassanios fault  and from the fifth scene of the same act another passage may be quoted which breathes the same strain  portia and lorenzo lorenzo madam although i speak it in your presence you have a noble and a true conceit of godlike amity which appears most strongly in bearing thus the absence of your lord but if you knew on whom you show this honor how true a gentleman you send relief to how dear a lover of my lord your husband i know you would be prouder of this work than customary bounty could enforce you  portia i never did repent of doing good and shall not now for in companions that do converse and waste the time together whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love there needs must be a like proportion of lineaments of manners and of spirit which makes me think that this anthonio being the bosom lover of my lord must needs be like my lord if it be so how little is the cost i have bestowed in purchasing the semblance of my soul from out the state of hellish cruelty this comes too near the praising of myself therefore no more of it  there is a becoming reserve and modesty in this last sentence which gives an additional beauty to the character of portia but i must now return again to the first act that i may recover the order of the reflections which are made in this piece  scene ii here the golden mean is well recommended by showing the excess on either side to be equally bad portia and nerissa portia by my troth nerissa my little body is weary of this great world   nerissa you would be sweet madam if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are and yet for aught i see they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing therefore it is no mean happiness to be seated in the mean superfluity comes sooner by white hairs but competency lives longer     from thence portia takes occasion to hint at the inefficacy of good counsel toward governing or restraining our passions portia good sentences and well pronounced   nerissa they would be better if well followed   portia if to do were as easy as to know what were good to do chapels had been churches and poor mens cottages princes palaces he is a good divine that follows his own instructions i can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow my own teaching the brain may devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps over a cold decree such a hare is madness the youth to skip over the mashes of good counsel the cripple     act ii scene i the next passage that occurs is a reflection on the casualties of fortune which no merit no industry no prudence can control  morochius to portia therefore i pray you lead me to the caskets to try my fortune by this scimitar that slew the sophy and a persian prince that won three fields from sultan solomon i would outstare the sternest eyes that look outbrave the heart most daring to the earth pluck the young sucking cubs from the shebear yea mock the lion when he roars for prey to win thee lady but alas the while if hercules and lichas page to hercules play at dice which is the better man the greater throw may turn by fortune from the weaker hand  so is alcides beaten by his page and so may i blind fortune leading me miss that which one unworthier may attain and die with grieving scene ii in this scene the soliloquy of lancelot is a strong picture of the mind of man whenever it debates within itself upon the right or wrong of a question in which it is any way interested for in such cases our passions even without our connivance are apt to plead their own cause and we but sophisticate while we think we reason in all doubtful matters where the arguments seem to be equally suspended it is prudent ever to suspect that side of the balance to be the lightest which we find our affections the most inclined to  lancelot certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this jew my master the fiend is at my elbow and tempts me saying to me gobbo lancelot gobbo good lancelot or good gobbo or good lancelot gobbo use your legs take the start run away my conscience says no take heed honest lancelot take heed honest gobbo or as aforesaid honest lancelot gobbo do not run scorn running with the heels well the most courageous fiend bids me pack via says the fiend away says the fiend for the heavens rouse up a brave mind says the fiend and run well my conscience hanging about the neck of my heart says very wisely to me my honest friend lancelot being an honest mans son or rather an honest womans son for indeed my father did something smack something grow to he had a kind of taste  well my conscience says budge not budge says the fiend budge not says my conscience conscience says i you counsel ill fiend says i you counsel ill to be ruled by my conscience i should stay with the jew my master who god bless the mark is a kind of devil and to run away from the jew i should be ruled by the fiend who saving your reverence is the devil himself certainly the jew is the very devil incarnal and in my conscience my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience to offer to counsel me to stay with the jew the fiend gives the more friendly counsel i will run fiend my heels are at your commandment i will run   scene ix the description here given of the parting of two friends would make a beautiful and affecting subject for the pencil salanio and even there his eye being big with tears turning his face he put his hand behind him and with affection wondrous sensible he wrung bassanios hand and so they parted    scene x the false or mistaken supputations of happiness which men are too often apt to frame to themselves are well remarked upon in this place prince of arragon on viewing the caskets with their mottos fortune now to my hearts hope gold silver and base lead who choseth m must give and hazard all he has leaden cset  you shall look fairer ere i give or hazard what says the golden chest ha let me see  who chooses me shall gain what many men desire what many men desire  that may be meant of the fool multitude that choose by show not learning more than the fond eye does teach which pries not to the interior but like the martlet builds in the weather on the outward wall even in the force and road of casualty i will not choose what many men desire because i will not jump with common spirits and rank me with the barbarous multitude   and immediately after in the same speech he makes a just and noble reflection distinguishing merit from dignities or titles to from titles of honor  well then to thee thou silver treasurehouse tell me once more what title thou do bear  who chooses me shall get as much as he deserves and well said too for who shall go about to cozen fortune and be honorable without the stamp of merit let none presume to wear an undeserved dignity  o that estates degrees and offices were not derived corruptly that clear honor were purchased by the merit of the wearer how many then should cover that stand bare how many be commanded that command how much low peasantry would then be picked picked instead of gleaed  from the true seed of honor how much honor gleaned gleaned instead of picked johnson from the chaff and ruin of the times to be new vanned vanned of ined instead of varnished warburton  these three alterations certainly preserve the purity of the metaphor from the manifest corruption of the text    act iii scene i the great principle of universal charity which soars above the partial respects of nations or of sects is strongly though indirectly inculcated in the jews speech here which according to this very principle should be received without prejudice though proceeding from the mouth of an alien and an infidel  shylock speaking of anthonio he has disgraced me and hindered me of half a million laughed at my losses mocked at my gains scorned my nation thwarted my bargains cooled my friends heated mine enemies and what is his reason i am a jew has not a jew eyes has not a jew hands organs dimensions senses affections passions fed with the same food hurt by the same weapons subject to the same diseases healed by the same means warmed and cooled by the same summer and winter as a christian is if you prick us do we not bleed if you tickle us do we not laugh if you poison us do we not die  as the remainder of the speech exceeds the moderation of christian ethics i think proper to stop the jews mouth here  the same person says something again to the like purport in the first scene of act the fourth that ought to awaken our minds to proper sentiments of humanity upon this subject  shylock you have among you many a purchased slave which like your asses and your dogs and mules you use in abject and in slavish part because you bought them  shall i say to you let them be free marry them to your heirs why sweat they under burdens let their beds be made as soft as yours and let their palates be seasoned with such viands  you will answer the slaves are ours  montesquieu in his spirit of laws speaking with a just contempt and humorous severity against all the arguments brought in defense of this cruelty says that the strongest reason which can be given for the practice of using negroes like beasts of burden is their having black skins and flat noses  in the second scene of the third act the difficulty of determining the true rate of persons or things is largely commented upon and as opinion is too often more under the dominion of fancy than of reason perhaps the stanzas which precede the reflections may serve as a proper prelude to the speech the reader at least i dare say will be pleased at finding them inserted here  a song while bassanio debates with himself on his choice of the caskets tell me where is fancy bred in the heart or in the head how begot how nourished reply it is engendered in the eyes with gazing fed and fancy dies in the cradle where it lies let us all ing fancys knell i will begin it  ding dong bell  chorus ding dong bell after which bassanio speaks so may the outward shows be least themselves as the beginning of this speech is abrupt we are to suppose the former part of the argument to have passed silently in his mind before he speaks aloud  is tor johnsons remark  the world is still deceived with ornament in law what plea so tainted and corrupt but being seasoned with a gracious voice obscures the show of evil in religion what damned error but some sober brow will bless it and approve it with a text hiding the grossness with fair ornament there is no vice so simple but assumes some mark of virtue on its outward part how many cowards whose hearts are all as false as stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins the beards of hercules and frowning mars who inward searched have livers white as milk and these assume but valors excrement to render them redoubted  look on beauty and you shall see it is purchased by the weight which therein works a miracle in nature making them lightest that wear most of it so are those crispy snaky golden locks which make such wanton gambols with the wind upon supposed fairness often known to be the dowry of a second head the skull that bred them in the sepulcher thus ornament is but the gilded shore to a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf veiling an indian dowdy dowdy  the word in the text is beauty but reformed by sir thomas hanmer  in a word the seeming truth which cunning times put on to entrap the wisest then thou gaudy gold hard food for midas i will none of thee nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge twixt man and man but thou thou meagre lead which rather threatenest than do promise aught thy plainness instead of paleness johnson moves me more than eloquence and here choose i  joy be the consequence   portias rapture on finding her favorite lover has chosen right is warmly and finely expressed in the next speech in which the danger of an excess of joy is also pointed out how all the other passions fleet to air  as doubtful thoughts and rashembraced despair and shuddering fear and greeneyed jealousy o love be moderate allay thy ecstasy in measure rein rein instead of rain ditto thy joy scant this excess i feel too much thy blessing make it less for fear i surfeit   in the fifth scene following there is a ridiculous but whimsical description of a vain boasting young man many of which sort are to be met with in life in courts in camps in coffeehouses portia and nerissa going into boys clothes portia i will hold thee any wager when we are both apparelled like young men i will prove the prettier fellow of the two and wear my dagger with the braver grace and speak between the change of man and boy with a reed voice and turn two mincing steps into a manly stride and speak of frays like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lies how honorable ladies sought my love which i denying they fell sick and died then i will repent and wish for all that that i had not killed them and twenty of these puny lies i will tell that men shall swear i have discontinued school above a twelvemonth  i have in my mind a thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks which i will practice    act iv scene ii the character of mercy is here most beautifully described this passage can never be too often read there is no danger of its growing feared and tedious measure for measure act ii scene x  as angelo says of the laws of justice  portia pleading for anthonio the quality of mercy is not strained it droppeth as the gentle rain of heaven upon the place beneath it is twice blessed it blesses him that gives and him that takes it is mightiest in the mightiest it becomes the throned monarch better than his crown his scepter shows the force of temporal power the attribute to awe and majesty wherein does sit the dread and fear of kings but mercy is above this sceptred sway it is enthroned in the hearts of kings it is an attribute to god himself and earthly poer does then show likest gods when mercy seasons justice therefore jew though justice be thy plea consider this that in the course of justice none of us should see salvation we do pray for mercy and that same prayer does teach us all to render the deeds of mercy there is also a passage in the same scene where the pro and con for partial justice is rightly argued on both sides but terminates as i fear it should do for the safety of a state in stoical strictness  bassanio to portia in the character of a judge and i beseech you wrest once the law to your authority to do a great right do a little wrong and curb this cruel devil of his will portia it must not be there is no power in venice should alter a decree established twill be recorded for a precedent and many an error by the same example will rush into the state  it cannot be  we have also here some philosophic reflections on the advantages of dying before we are encumbered with age and poverty with a manly spirit of acquiescence in the unavoidable ills of life joined to the affecting tenderness and generous regards of friendship  anthonio when the jew has obtained sentence against him i am armed and well prepared  give me your hand bassanio fare ye well grieve not that i am fallen to this for you for herein fortune shows herself more kind than is her custom it is still her use to let the wretched man outlive his wealth to view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow an age of poverty from which lingering penance of such a misery does she cut me off  commend me to your honorable wife tell her the process of anthonios end say how i loved you speak me fair in death and when the tale is told bid her be judge whether bassanio had not once a love repent not you that you shall lose your friend and he repents not that he pays your debt for if the jew do cut but deep enough i will pay it instantly with all my heart   it is a pity this fine speech should be disgraced by the quibble in the last expression  act v scene i the enchanting powers and effects of music are here most poetically set forth there can never be said too much on this charming theme mens minds may be sometimes too stern or obstinate to yield to argument but in melody there is a sort of sentiment that sinks into the heart and by awaking the softer passions of the soul often persuades where reason else would fail  lorenzo and jessica a sound of music jssica i am never merry when i hear sweet music  lorenzo the reason is your spirits grow attentive for do but note a wild and wanton herd or race of youthful and unhandled colts fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud which is the mad condition of their blood if they perchance but hear a trumpet sound or any air of music touch their ears you shall perceive them make a mutual stand their savage eyes turned to a modest gaze by the sweet power of music therefore the poet did feign that orpheus drew trees stones and floods since none so stickish hard and full of rage but music for the time does change his nature  the man that has no music in himself nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils the motions of his spirit are dull as night and his affections dark as erebus  let no such man be trusted his niger est hunc tu roman caveto hor   there is also a beautiful allusion made to the light of a candle in this place which with the moral deduced from it is i think worthy to be noted here  portia and nerissa poria how far that little candle throws its beams so shines a good deed in a naughty world  so says the scripture let your light so shine and in the continuation of the same dialogue the effects of time circumstance comparison and occasion are beautifully and justly pointed out nerissa when the moon shone we did not see the candle  portia so does the greater glory dim the less a substitute shines brightly as a king until a king be by and then his state empties itself as does an inland brook into the main of waters music hark  nerissa it is your music madam of the house  portia nothing is good i see without respect that is reference to time place or other circumstance  methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day  nerissa silence bestows the virtue on it madam  portia the crow does sing as sweetly as the lark when neither is attended and i think the nightingale if she should sing by day when every goose is cackling would be thought no better a musician than the wren how many things by season seasoned are to their right praise and true perfection    the next quotation and the last i shall transcribe from this play is in the same scene where portia accosts her husbands friend anthonio on his first visit to her after the catastrophe of the piece has been wound up sir you are welcome to our house  it must appear in other ways than words therefore i scant this breathing courtesy   in this speech she very justly expresses the true sentiment of affection which renders professions needless where intentions are sincere  as you like it dramatis personae men a duke exiled from his dominions amiens attending upon the duke in his banishment jaques attending upon the duke in his banishment a lord attending upon the duke in his banishment oliver eldest son to sir rowland de boys orlando his brother adam an old steward of sir rowland de boys touchstone an attendant on celia and rosalind corin an old shepherd sylvius a young one women rosalind daughter to the duke celia daughter to frederick his brother the usurper as you like it act i scene i this play begins with a reflection on the first and i may add the principal concern in life the education of children men are often more sedulous in training the brutes of their kennels their mews and their stables than they seem to be about the heirs of their blood their fortunes or their honors in sad truth may it be said that we seldom meet with a jockey an huntsman or a sportsman who is half so wellbred as his horses his hawks or his hounds  orlando speaking of the unkindness of his elder brother and guardian says for my part he keeps me rustically at home or to speak more properly flies me here at home unkept for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox his horses are bred better for besides that they are fair with their feeding they are taught their manage and to that end riders dearly hired but i his brother gain nothing under him but growth for the which the animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as i besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me he lets me feed with his hinds bars me the place of a brother and as much as in him lies mines mines for undermines my gentility with my education  scene iii the last speech here though it presents us with no moral i cannot pass by without remarking that it seems to be a perfect description of our authors own character  oliver speaking of orlando his younger brother says yet he is gentle never schooled and yet learned full of noble device and of all sorts enchantingly beloved   scene iv there are some passages very tender generous and affecting in the first part of the dialogue between rosalind and celia who had been bred up from their infancy in friendship together the first daughter to the exiled duke and the other child to his brother the usurper  celia i pray thee rosalind sweet my coz be merry   rosalind dear celia i show more mirth than i am mistress of and would you yet i were merrier unless you could teach me to forget a banished father you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure   celia herein i see thou love me not with the full weight that i love thee if my uncle thy banished father had banished thy uncle the duke my father so thou had been still with me i could have taught my love to take thy father for mine and so would thou if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously tempered as mine is to thee   rosalind well i will forget the condition of my estate and rejoice in yours   celia you know my father has no child but me nor none is like to have and truly when he dies thou shall be his heir for what he has taken away from thy father perforce i will render thee again in affection  by mine honor i will  and when i break that oath let me turn monster  therefore my sweet rose my dear rose be merry   the same fondness between them is repeated in the tenth scene of the same act upon rosalinds being commanded to quit the dominions of the usurper  celia o my poor rosalind where will thou go will thou change fathers i will give thee mine  i charge thee be not thou more grieved than i am  rosalind i have more cause  celia thou have not cousin prithee be cheerful  know thou not the duke has banished me his daughter  rosalind that he has not  celia no has not rosalind lacks then the love which teaches me that thou and i are one  shall we be sundered shall we part sweet girl no let my father seek another heir  therefore devise with me how we may fly whither to go and what to bear with us and do not seek to take your change upon you to bear your griefs yourself and leave me out for by this heaven now at our sorrows pale say what thou can i will go along with thee  as there are many vices in morals that are injurious to society and which the laws have not stigmatized or possibly cannot sufficiently provide against the reprehensions of satire under proper restrictions may perhaps be deemed a necessary supplement to legislation the most worthless person would choose to sin in secret as not being able to endure the being rendered an object of public detestation or ridicule the fear of being pointed at has often laid a restraint on vice in which sense the finger may be said to be stronger than the arm othello pathetically describes such a situation but alas to make me a fixed figure for the hand of scorn to point his slow unmoving finger at   the passage which gave rise to these reflections is in this fourth scene where celia interrupts touchstone in his abuse of an absent person enough speak no more of him you will be whipped for taxation one of these days  touchstone the more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly   celia by my troth thou say true for since the little wit that fools have was silenced alluding to the jesters that were formerly entertained by kings and were the only courtiers that were suffered to speak their minds this office has been ng abolished  the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show     scene viii there is a very proper hint given here to women not to deviate from the prescribed rules and decorums of their sex whenever they venture to step the least out of their walk in life they are too generally apt to wander astray  rosalind oh how full of briars is this workingday world   celia they are but burs cousin thrown upon thee in holiday foolery if we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats will catch them   scene x rosalind speaking of disguising herself in mans apparel gives a good description of a swaggering bully were it not better because that i am more than common tall that i did suit me al points like a man a gallant curtleax upon my thigh a boarspear in my hand and in my heart lie there what hidden womans fear there will i will have a swashing and a martial outside as many other mannish cowards have that do outface it with their semblances see portias speech in the fifth scene third act of the merchant of  in the work for a parallel passage of female sportive humor    act ii scene i the first speech in this scene is rich in reflection upon the newmoulding faculty of use or habit the preference of a sincere country life to a false city one the advantages of adversity and the benefits of retired contemplation  the duke amiens and other lords in the forest of arden duke now my comates and brothers in exile has not old ustm made this life more sweet than that of painted pomp see  observation on scene iv act v of the two gentlemen of  the power of use or habit  are not these woods more free from peril than the envious court here feel we but the penalty of adam the seasons difference as the icy fang and chursh chiding of the winters wind which when it bites and blows upon my body even till i shrink with cold i smile and say t  flattery these are counselors that feelingly persuade me what i am sweet are the uses of adversity which like the toad ugly and venomous wears yet a precious jewel in his head this was an ancient notion  and this our life exempt from public haunt finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks sermons in stones and good in every thing i would not change it  amiens happy is your grace that can translate the stubbornness of fortune into so quiet and so sweet a style  in the continuation of the same dialogue some humane sentiments are thrown out on the subject of hunting with an affecting description given of a wounded deer and also some moral allusions from human life to the different circumstances and situations of the poor victim which must equally engage the thought and feeling of the reader  duke come shall we go and kill us venison and yet it irks me the poor dappled fools being native burghers of this desert city should in their own confines with forked heads have their round haunches gored  first lord indeed my lord the melancholy jaques a character distinguished for humanity contemplation and contempt of the world and consequently for singularity grieves at that and in that kind swears you no more usurp than does your brother that has banished you that is you usurp as much  to day my lord of amiens and myself did steal behind him as he lay along under an oak whose antique root peeps out upon the brook that brawls along this wood to the which place a poor sequestered stag that from the hunters aim had taken a hurt did come to languish and indeed my lord the wretched animal heaved forth such groans that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat almost to bursting and the big round tears coursed one another down his innocent nose in piteous chase  and thus the hairy fool much marked of the melancholy jaques stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook augmenting it with tears   duke but what said jaques did he not moralize this spectacle  first lord o yes into a thousand similies first for his weeping in the needless stream  poor deer quoth he thou make a testament as worldlings do giving thy sum of more to that which had too much then being alone left and abandoned of his velvet friends  it is right quoth he thus misery does part the flux of company anon a careless herd full of the pasture jumps along by him and never stays to greet him  ay quoth jaques sweep on ye fat and greasy citizens it is just the fashion wherefore do you look upon that poor and broken bankrupt there thus most invectively he pierces through the body of the country city court yea and of this our life swearing that we are mere usurpers tyrants and what is worse to ight the animals and to kill them up in their assigned and native dwelling place  duke and did you leave him in this contemplation  second lord we did my lord weeping and commenting upon the obing deer   duke show me the place i love to cope him in these sullen fits for then he is full of matter  whoever could read the above description and eat venison on the same day must have a better stomach or a stouter heart than they would do well to boast of  such melancholy such sullen fits as these of jaques have something more charming in them than all the broadest mirth unfeeling folly wears  scene iii the dangers of preeminence and virtue in a wicked and envious world are finely noted here  adam meeting orlando after he had conquered the usurpers champion what my young master oh my gentle master oh my sweet master oh you memory of old sir rowland why what make you here why are you virtuous why do people love you and wherefore are you gentle strong and valiant why would you be so fond to overcome the boney prizer wrestler of the humorous for humorsome duke your praise is come too swiftly home before you know you not master to some kind of men their graces serve them but as enemies no more do yours your virtues gentle master are sanctified and holy traitors to you o what a world is this when what is comely envenoms him that bears it   when adam counsels him to fly from the persecution of his cruel brother his answer expresses a noble and virtuous acquiescence in any state of misery or danger rather than submit to support himself by base or dishonest means orlando what would thou have me go and beg my food or with a base and boisterous sword enforce a thievish living on the common road this i must do or know not what to do  yet this i cannot do do how i can i rather will subject me to the malice of a diverted for estranged blood and bloody brother    there is a charming glow of affection gratitude and spirit in the reply made by adam with a pleasing description of the virtue and sobriety of the ancient peasantry of england and the difference of manners and morals between those times and the more modern ones is well remarked upon  adam but do not so  i have five hundred crowns the thrifty hire i saved under your father which i did store to be my fosternurse when service should in my old limbs lie lame and unregarded age in corners thrown  take that and he that does the ravens seed yea providentially caters for the sparrow be comfort to my age here is the gold all this i give you let me be your servant  though i look old yet i am strong and lusty for in my youth i never did apply hot and rebellious liquors in my blood nor did i with unbashful forehead woo the means of weakness and debility therefore my age is as a lusty winter frosly but kindly cicero say a well spert yh s d an ly age  let me go with you i will do the business of a younger man in all your business and necessities  orlando oh good old man how well in thee appear the constant service of the antique world when service sweat for duty not for meed thou art not for the fashion of these times where none will sweat but for promotion and having that do cloak their service up even with the having it is not so with thee  but poor old man thou prunst a rotten tree that cannot so much as a blossom yield in lieu of all thy pains and husbandry  but come thy ways well go along together and ere we have thy youthful wages spent well light upon some settled low content  adam master go on and i will follow thee to the last gasp with truth and loyalty  from seventeen years till now almost fourscore here lived i but now live here no more at seventeen years many their fortune seek but at fourscore it is too late a week yet fortune cannot recompense me better than to die well and not my masters debtor  scene iv the nature and follies of love are here extremely well described between the several speakers  silvius o corin that thou knew how i do love her  corin i partly guess for i have loved ere now  silvus no corin being old thou can not guess though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover as ever sighed upon a midnight pillow but if hy love were ever like to mine as sure i think did never man love so how many actions most ridiculous have thou been drawn to by thy fantasy  corin into a thousand that i have forgotten  slviu o thou did then never love so heartily it thou rememberest not the slightest folly that ever love did make thee run into thou have not loved  or if thou have not sat as i do now wearing the hearer in thy mistress praise thou have not loved  or if thou have not broke from company abruptly as my passion now makes me thou have not loved  o phebe phebe phebe exit  rosalind alas poor shepherd searching of thy wound i have by hard adventure found my own   touchstone and i mine i remember when i was in love i broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming anights to jane smile and i remember the kissing of her batlet or beatle a sort of mallet which washwomen beat the dirt out of coarse linens with in a pond or stream  and the cows dugs that her pretty chopped hands had milked and i remember the wooing a peascod instead of her from whom i took two peace and giving her them again said with weeping tears wear these for my sake we that are true lovers run into strange capers but as all is mortal in nature so is all nature in love mortal mortal for abounding johnson in folly   there is a very pretty poem on the same subject and which seems to have taken its hint from this passage in shakespeare though the instances are different and more in number written by miss aikin among a collection of here is lately published which i would insert here but that i suppose every reader of taste must be in possession of a work which so well deserves a place in the most select libraries as doing equal honor to literature and her sex see page    of her poems  scene v the common or modern modes of civility are well enough ridiculed here which however does not by any means reprove the fond expressions of affection or the warm returns of gratitude  jaques well then if ever i thank any man i will thank you but that they call compliments is like the encounter of two dogapes and when a man thanks me heartily methinks i have given him a penny and he renders me the beggarly thanks for it   in the same place the melancholy jaques as he is characterized though he be of a gloomy and unsociable complexion himself describes a character in one word that in my opinion is still more unqualified for the converse of the world than his own  when he is told that the duke has been all the day to look for him he replies and i have been all this day to avoid him he is too disputable for disputaticus for my company i think of as many matters as he but i give heaven thanks and make no boast of them that is i enjoy my own reflections but force not my thoughts or opinions upon others   scene vi there is something extremely pathetic and affecting in this short scene between orlando and adam on their pilgrimage  adam dear master i can go no further o i die for food here lie i down and measure out my grave farewell kind master   orlando why how now adam no greater heart in thee live a little comfort a little cheer thyself a little if this uncouth forest yield any thing savage i will be either food for it or bring it for food to thee thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers for my sake be comfortable for comforted  hold death awhile at the arms end i will be here with thee presently and if i bring the not something to eat i will give thee leave to die but if thou die before i come thou art a mocker of my labor well said  thou look cheerly and i will be with you quickly yet thou lie in the bleak air come i will bear thee to some shelter and thou shall not die for the lack of a dinner if there live any thing in this desert cheerly good adam   scene vii trite observations and commonplace morals are well exposed here jaques as i do live by food i met a fool who laid him down and baskd him in the sun and raised on lady fortune in good terms  in good set terms  and yet a motley fool good morrow fool quoth i no sir quoth he call me not fool till heaven has sent me fortune  and then he drew a dial from his poke and looking on it with lacklustre eye says very wisely it is ten oclock thus we may see quoth he how the world wags it is but an hour ago since it was nine and after one hour more twill be eleven and so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe and then from hour to hour we rot and rot  duke what fool is this  jaques a worthy fool one that has been a courtier and says if ladies be but young and fair they have the gift to know it  and in his brain which is as dry as the remainder biscuit after a voyage he has strange places crammed with observations the which he vents in mangled forms    in the same scene there is a good defense made for general satire  jaques being accused of slander says why who cries out on pride that can therein tax any private party does it not flow as hugely as the sea till that the very very means do ebb what woman in the city do i name when that i say the citywoman bears the cost of princes on unworthy shoulders who can come in and say that i mean her when such a one as she such is her neighbor or what is he of basest function that says his bravery is not on my cost thinking that i mean him but therein suits his folly to the metal of my speech there then how then what then let me see wherein my tongue has wronged for if it do him right then he has wronged himself if he be free why then my taxing like a wild goose flies unclaimd of any man   see the last remark on scene iv act i of this play  scene viii the following passage requires no comment to point out its beauties or to mark its impression  orlando traveling through the forest with his poor old friend leaves him for a while to go in quest of food as shown before in the last scene but one and coming where the duke and his train are at dinner draws his sword to force some of the viands from them the former scene already quoted prepares us finely for orlandos violence here which must otherwise have created disgust and seem to have been inconsistent with his expression in the third scene above where he says to adam what would thou have me go and beg my food or with a base and boisterous sword enforce a thievish living on the common road   upon this challenge the duke says what would thou have your gentleness shall force more than your force move us to gentleness orlando i almost die for food and let me have it  duke sit down and feed and welcome to our table  orlando speak you so gently pardon me i pray you i thought that all things had been savage here and therefore put i on the countenance of stern commandment but whatever you are that in this desert inaccessible under the shade of melancholy boughs less and neglect the creeping hours of time if ever you have looked on better days if ever been where bells have knolled to church if ever sat at any good mans feast if ever from your eyelids wiped a tear and knw what it is to pity and be pitied let gentleness my strong enforcement be in he which hope i blush and hide my sword  duke true is it that we have seen better days and have with holy bell been knolled to church and sat at good mens feasts and wiped our eyes of drps that sacred pity has engendered and therefore sit you down in gentleness and take upon command what help we have that to your wanting may be ministered  orlando then but forbear your food a little while whiles like a do i go to find my fawn and give it food there is an old poor man who after me has many a weary step limped in pure love till he be first sufficed oppressed with two weak evils age and hunger i will not touch a bit  duke go find him out and we will nothing waste till your return  orlando i thank ye and be blessed for your comfort exit    scene ix on orlandos going out the duke says thou see we are not all alone unhappy  this wide and universal theater presents more woeful pageants than the scene wherein we play   upon which allusion jaques gives a fine picturesque and dramatic description of life and character in the following speech all the worlds a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts his acts being seven ages the old plays were divided into seven acts warburton  at first the infant mewling and puking in the nurses arms and then the whining schoolboy with his satchel and shining morning face creeping like snail unwillingly to school and then the lover sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad made to his mistress eyebrow then a soldier full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard jealous in honor sudden and quick in quarrel seeking the bubble reputation even in the cannons mouth and then the justice in fair round belly with good capon lined with eyes severe and beard of formal cut full of wise saws and modern instances and so he plays his part the sixth age shifts into the lean and slippered pantaloon alluding to that general character in the italian comedy  with spectacles on nose and pouch on side his youthful hose well saved a world too wide for his shrunk shank and his big manly voice turning again toward childish tremble pipes and whistles in his sound last scene of all that ends this strange eventful history is second childishness and mere oblivion sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans every thing   scene x some melancholy reflections on the base vice and most heinous sin of ingratitude are sweetly comprised in the following air blow blow the winter wind that art not so unkind as mans ingratitude thy tooth is not so keen because thou art not seen although thy breath be rude heigh ho heigh ho unto the green holly most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly then heigh ho the holly this life is most jolly this line is left without a comment in all the editions or am i able to supply one upon it such a life as is here described appears rather to be a sad than a jolly one i am as much at a loss also to guess why the bolly is particularly invoked here  freeze freeze thou bitter sky that do not bite so nigh as benefits forgot though thou the waters warp thy sting is not so sharp as friend remembered not heigh ho etc   act iii scene iii no situation of life is satisfactory to us there is something we like in all but none that we would choose to take up with for better for worse this impatience this dissatisfaction in the mind of man proclaims aloud that this world was never designed as our place of rest and to refer us for it to the grave is but infidel mockery surely  i am well aware that after so serious a reflection the following passage may be deemed too slight an illustration of the remark but as it gave rise to it i think in justice that i ought to quote it here for even a straw is an argument of providence to the contemplative mind  corin and touchstone corin and how like you this shepherds life mr touchstone   touchstone truly shepherd in respect of itself it is a good life but in respect that it is a shepherds life it is naught in respect that it is solitary i like it very well but in respect that it is private it is a very vile life now in respect that it is in the fields it pleases me well but in respect it is not in the court it is tedious as it is a spare life look you it fits my humor well but as there is no more plenty in it it goes much against my stomach   scene iv the common singsong of poetry is well observed upon here such verses as horace says a person may compose two hundred of standing on one leg stans pede in n  without one thought to interrupt the song  rosalind reading a paper written in her praise from the east to western inde no jewel is like rosalind her worth being mounted on the wind through all the world bears rosalind all the pictures fairest limned are but black to rosalind let no face be kept in mind but the face of rosalind   upon which touchstone says i will rhyme you so eight years together dinners and suppers and sleeping hours excepted it is the right butterwomans rate to market this is the very false gallop of verses why do you infect yourself with them  scene viii the different computations of time which are made by persons variously interested in its progression are well and humorously described in this place  rosalind and orlando rosalind i pray you what is it a clock   orlando you should ask me what time oday  there is no clock in the forest   rosalind then there is no true lover in the forest else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock   orlando and why not the swift foot of time had not that been as proper   rosalind by no means sir time travels in diverse paces with diverse persons  i will tell you whom time trots withal whom time ambles withal whom time gallops withal and whom he stands still withal   orlando i prithee whom does he trot withal   rosalind marry he trots hard by hard is meant high which is the most fatiguing rate to a traveller with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized if the interim be but a sennight times pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven years   orlando whom ambles time withal   rosalind with a priest that lacks latin and a rich man that has not the gout for the one sleeps easily because he cannot study and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning and the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury these time ambles withal   orlando whom does he gallop withal   rosalind with a thief to the gallows for though he go softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there   orlando who stays at withal   rosalind with lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how time moves   scene x enter rosalind and celia rosalind never talk to me  i will weep   celia do i prithee but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man she was then dressed in a male habit    rosalind but have i not cause to weep   celia as good cause as one would desire therefore weep   rosalind his very hair is of the dissembling color   celia something browner than judass  marry his kisses are judass own children   rosalind no faith his hair is of a good color   celia an excellent color your chestnut was ever the only color   rosalind and his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy beard   celia he has bought a pair of cast lips of diana a nun of winters sisterhood kisses not more religiously the very ice of chastity is in them   the abrupt commencement of this dialogue leads us to suppose that it is but the continuation of one they had engaged in before their appearance in this scene in which celia had been endeavoring to quiet rosalinds fears upon her lovers having broke his promise of meeting her and whether from being tired with her obstinacy or resolving to try her sincerity she here seems to join in her resentment by agreeing with her in every thing which has an effect very natural in all such cases that the plaintiff immediately becomes defendant whenever the person beloved happens to be censured by any one else but themselves  hermione says my heart though full of rage was free from malice and all my anger but excess of love distressed mother    and the danger of interfering between man and wife i should hope arises from this principle resentments may interrupt affection but they must rise to something more to cancel one that ever has been thoroughly conceived  scene xi rosalind foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer   this is a just thought and it would be well if it were more attended to no persons have a right to censure others who are not free from blame themselves this maxim if extended to the strictness of it would silence all scandal detraction and reproach and indeed it has been often observed that the most faultless persons are generally the least severe heaven has more mercy than man  act iv scene i as i have already given the reader some extracts of the character and sentiments of the melancholy jaques in this play which must give a favorable impression of him i think he will be well pleased to see him introduced once more particularly in a part where he gives a description of himself as he does in this scene and where the lively rosalind also equally and justly condemns the extremes both of a merry and a grave complexion of mind and manners  rosalind and jaques rosalind they say you are a melancholy fellow   jaques i am so  i do love it better than laughing   rosalind those who are in the extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards   jaques why it is good to be sad and say nothing   rosalind why then it is good to be a post   jaques i have neither the scholars melancholy which is emulation nor the musicians which is fantastic nor the courtiers which is proud nor the soldiers which is ambitious nor the lawyers which is politic nor the ladies which is nice nor the lovers which is all these but it is a melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples extracted from many objects and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels on which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous h for  sadness   rosalind and your experience makes you sad i had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad  and to travel for it too   rosalind then taking advantage of the word travel gives a description of the alamode pilgrims of shakespeares times which may answer full as well for the fashionable emigrants of our own days  farewell monsieur traveller look you lisp and wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your own country be out of love with your nativity and almost chide god for making you that countenance you are or i shall scarce think you have swam in a gondola venice was then the polite goal as paris is now so that to swim in a conold is as if we should say ride in a visavis at present  there is something upon the whole of this sombre character of jaques that is interesting and makes me recollect a french line of some uncommon because ingenious and indulgent critic who says un esprit ne chagrin plait par son chagrin meme  scene v there is no passion which shakespeare more frequently or so poetically describes as that of love and as it is the one which by its despotism in our youthful years often forms the destiny of our future life and holds so immediate a relation to morals we should suffer no occasion to pass unnoticed however humorously or ludicrously expressed which either defines its nature or remarks upon its effects  rosalind no that same wicked bastard of venus that was begot of thought conceived of spleen and born of madness that blind rascally boy that abuses every ones eyes because his own are out let him be judge how deep i am in love i tell thee aliena i cannot be out of the sight of orlando  i will go find a shadow shadow for shade  and sigh till he come   act v scene v the uncertainty of opinion in things where the mind is anxious is hinted at here the duke and orlando duke do thou believe orlando that the boy can do all this that he has promised  orlando i sometimes do believe and sometimes do not as those that fear they hope and now they fear this line is thus amended by dr johnson     scene vi touchstone to the duke rich honesty dwells like a miser sir in a poor house as your pearl in your soul oyster  men who pretend to know the world are apt to jon in the above satire upon mankind by saying what i am sorry to repeat that if we were to seek for honesty we must look for it as the clown hints among the middle ranks of life  the punctilios of honor with regard to the false bravery or gothic chivalry of duelling is admirably jested on in the same scene  jaques and touchstone jaques but for the seventh cause how did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause   touchstone upon a lie seven times removed as thus sir  i did dislike the cut of a certain courtiers beard he sent me word if i said his beard was not cut well he was in the mind it was this is called the retort courteous if i sent him word again it was not well cut he would send me word he cut it to please himself this is called the qup modest if again it was not well cut he disabled my judgment this is called the reply churlish if again it was not well cut he would answer i spoke not true this is called the reproof valiant if again it was not well cut he would say i lie this is called the countercheck quarrelsome and so the lie circumstantial and the lie direct   jaques and how often did you say that his beard was not well cut   touchstone i durst go no further than the lie circumstantial nor durst he give me the lie direct and so we measured swords and parted i suppose this must have been an ancient usage to see whether the combatants has entered the lifts upon equal terms of chivalry    jaques can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie   touchstone o sir we quarrel in print by the book as you have books for good manners i will name you the degrees the first the retort courteous the second the quip modest the third the reply churlish the fourth the reproof valiant the fifth the cubeck quarrelsome the sixth the lie with circumstance and the seventh the lie direct all these you may avoid but the lie direct and you may avoid that too with an if i knew when seven justices could not make up a quarrel but when the parties were met themselves one of them thought but of an if as if you said so then i said so and they shook hands and swore brothers your if is your only peacemaker  much virtue in an if   doctor warburton in a note on this passage has quoted a similar one from fletcher in his queen of corinth has he familiarly disliked your yellow starch or said your doublet was not exactly frenchified or drawn your sword cried twas ill mounted has he given the lie in circle or oblique or semicircle or direct parallel you must challenge him   as the humorous satire of don quixote came abroad into the world in shakespeares time perhaps he might have taken a hint for this piece of ridicule from that writing and fletcher may have copied his raillery from him again malta is the only place now where the old gothic chivalry is still preserved and that duelling is established by law  scene vii i shall now conclude my remarks on this play with a song in this scene which comprehends my favorite moral  air wedding is great

beautifully described and distinguished from false heroism in this place to conquer ourselves is greater than to vanquish others  the king of navarre and three of his principal courtiers biron longaville and dumain had determined upon a course of retirement and study for three years in order to fit themselves the better for their several departments in the state  king let fame that all hunt

abstinence  the grosser manner of these worlds delights he throws upon the gross worlds baser slaves  to love to wealth to pomp i pine and die and these are living in philosophy  biron speaking on this latter subject and justly condemning all study which is not made referable to the real uses or moral purposes of life says study is like the heavens glorious sun that will not be deep searched with saucy looks what have continual plodders ever won save base authority from others books these earthly godfathers of heavens lights that give a name to every fixed star have no more profit of their shining nights than those that walk and wot not what they are too much to know is to know naught but fame and every godfather can give a name   and again so study evermore is overshot while it does study to have what it would it does forget to do the thing it should and when it has the thing it hunteth most it is won as towns with fire so won so lost   seneca seems to be of the same opinion with our author where he says that to desire more knowledge than is sufficient for us here is intemperance  upon revising the articles of their mutual agreement they find that one of them must unavoidably be dispensed with on account of a particular reason of state that had not occurred to them in the drawing them up upon which the folly and danger of making vows is very justly descanted on they are made says doctor johnson on this passage without sufficient regard to the variations of life and are therefore broken by some unforeseen necessity they proceed commonly from a presumptuous

might mastered but by special grace  if i break faith this word shall speak for me i am forsworn on mere necessity  in the same scene our author exposes an extraordinary and yet no uncommon character in life  the king and his courtiers king our court you know is haunted with a refined traveller of spain a man in all the worlds new fashion planted that has a mint of phrases in his brain one whom the music of his own vain tongue does ravish like enchanting harmony a man of compliments whom right and wrong have chose as umpire of their mutiny this child of fancy that armado hight for interim to our studies shall relate in highborn words the worth of many a knight from tawny spain lost in the worlds debate how you delight my lords i know not i but i protest i love to hear him lie and i will use him for my minstrelsy  biron armado is a most illustrious wight a man of fine new words fashions own knight  the making right and wrong equally to choose him for their arbitrator is an admirable trait of an obsequious disposition and since we are upon this subject here i think it will be better to groupe the rest of the characters in this play together in this place though they refer to different scenes in it  in the third scene of this act there is a description which proves that one of the characteristics of the present age is not quite so modern as one might otherwise be apt to imagine  moth you are a gentleman and a gamester abbe le blanc speaking of the english passion for gaming says they have a way of getting rich with little pains or beggaing themselves with little pleasure    armado i confess both they are both the varnish of a complete man   in another place act ii scene i in a dialogue between the princess maria catharine and rosaline speaking of the courtiers maria says in normandy saw i this longaville a man of sovereign parts he is esteemed well fitted in the arts glorious in arms nothing becomes him ill that he would well the only foil of his fair virtues gloss if virtues gloss will stain with any soil is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will whose edge has power to cut whose will still will it should spare none that come within his power princess some merrymocking lord belike  is it so  maria they say so most that most his humors know  princess such shortlived wits do wither as they grow    the latter part of the character of longaville above described is an unhappy quality frequently to the persons themselves who happen to be infected with it it often makes enemies but never once a friend even those who are the most maliciously pleased with it against others still fear it against themselves sternes comparison of the jester and jestee to the mortgager and mortgagee in his trifo shardy is an excellent and just allusion the one may forget the debt but the other will not only remember but exact the penalty when payday comes  a personal satirist may be likened to a hatchetman sitting on the arm of a tree with his face turned to the trunk and cutting away before him who when he has dismembered the branch falls to the ground himself along with it  princess who are the rest  catharine the young dumain a wellaccomplished youth of all that virtue love for virtue loved most power to do most harm least knowing ill for he has wit to make an ill shape good and shape to win grace though he had no wit i saw him at the duke alensons once and much too little of that good i saw is my report to his great worthiness  rosaline another of these students at that time was there with him as i have heard otruth biron they called him but a merrier man within the limit of becoming mirth i never spent an hours talk withal his eye begets occasion for his wit for every object that the one does catch the other turns to a mirthmoving jest which his fair tongue conceits expositor delivers in such apt and gracious words that aged ears play truant at his tales and younger hearings are quite ravished so sweet and voluble is his discourse  lastly in the first scene of act iv there are two characters which appear the better for being placed in contrast with each other  nathanael and holofernes nathanael i praise god for you sir your reasons discourse or conversation at dinner have been sharp and sententious pleasant without scurrility witty without affectation audacious animated without impudency learned without opinion opinionativeness  and strange new without heresy i did converse this quondamday with a companion of the kings who is entitled nominated or called don adriano darmado   holofernes his humor is lofty his discourse peremptory his tongue filed his eye ambitious his gait majestical and his general behavior vain ridiculous and thrasonical he is too piqued too spruce too affected too odd as it were too peregrinate as i may call it he draws out the thread of his verbosity finer than the staple of his argument i abhor such fanatical phantasms such unsociable and pointdevise companions such rackers of orthography as to speak dout fine when he should say doubt det when he should pronounce debt d e b t not d e t he clepeth a calf caulf half haulf neighbor vocatur nebour neigh abbreviated ne  this is abominable which he would pronounce abominable  it insinuates me of infanity to be mad frantic   but to return the pedantry of scholastic definitions and the verbose style of law writings are properly ridiculed in the second scene of the first act in part of armados letter to the king giving an information of an offense committed against one of his statutes  so it is  besieged with fablecoloured melancholy i did commend the black oppressing humor to the most wholesome physic of thy healthgiving air and as i am a gentleman betook myself to walk the time when about the sixth hour when beasts most graze birds best peck and men sit down to that nourishment which is called supper  so much for the time when  now for the ground which  which i mean i walked upon  it is yeleped thy park  then for the place where  where i mean i did encounter that obscene and most preposterous event that draws from my snowwhite pen the eboncoloured ink which here thou viewest beholdest surveyest or see  but to the place where it stands northnortheast and by east from the west corner of thy curiousknotted garden there did i see that lowspirited swain that base minion of thy mirth that unlettered smallknowing soul that shallow vasal which as i remember hight costard sorted and consorted contrary to thy established proclaimed edict and continent canon with a child of our grandmother eve a female or for thy more understanding a woman  him have i sent to thee to receive the meed of punishment etc in the last scene of this first act there is a quaint description given of love but as it is spoken in the person of armado whose affected character has been already exposed i shall insert it here  love is a familiar love is a devil there is no evil angel but love  yet was sampson so tempted and he had an excellent strength yet was solomon so seduced and he had a very good wit  cupids butshaft is too hard for herculess club and therefore too much odds for a spaniards rapier  the passado he respects not the duello he regards not  his disgrace is to be called boy but his glory is to subdue men acts ii and iii what is worth noting in the second act has already been included in our excursion from the first and the third affords us no matter for observation  act iv scene i the false glory of ancient heroism is justly censured in the latter part of the following speech  the princess taking the bow to go a stagshooting thus argues with herself on a supposition either of her hitting or missing the quarry thus will i save my credit on the shoot  not wounding pity would not let me do it if wounding then it was to show my skill that more for praise than purpose meant to kill and out of question so it is sometimes glory grows guilty of detested crimes when for fames sake for praise an outward part we bend to that the working of the heart as i for praise alone now seek to spill the poor deers blood that my heart means no ill   scene iv part of a speech here is very worthy of a quotation first as it is one of the many fond descriptions of love given us by our author and next as it shows the effects of this passion in higher instances than any of his former ones by urging its advantages to the minds and manners as well as its operations upon the affections of men and in this light it may be considered as a good comment on the fable of cymon and iphigenia  biron speaking to the king dumain and longaville after they had all fallen in love against the phlegmatic and fruitless study of monastic life in a seclusion from all female converse says for when would you my liege or you or you in leaden contemplation have found out such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes of beauteous tutors have enriched you with other slow arts entirely keep the brain and therefore finding barren practisers scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil  but love first learned in a ladys eyes lives not alone immured in the brain but with the motion of all elements courses as swift as thought in every power and gives to every power a double power above their functions and their offices it adds a precious seeing to the eye a lovers eyes will gaze an eagle blind a lovers ear will hear the lowest ound when the suspicious hand of theft is stopped the fears of a thief are naturally alarmed upon the slightest noise i have ventured to alter head to hand in the above line  loves feeling is more soft and sensible than are the tender horns of cockled snails loves tongue proves dainty bacchus ross in taste for flavor the word in the text is valor but theobald changes it to savor in order to complete the enumeration of the senses and i prefer the word flavor as this refers more to fruits as the other to viands  is not love an hercules still climbing trees in the hesperides subtle as sphinx as sweet and musical as bright apollos lute strung with his hair and when love speaks the voice of all the gods make heaven drowsy with the harmony never durst poet touch a pen to write until his ink were tempered with loves tears i prefer tears to shs which is the text word as water is a fitter element than wind to temper ink with  the last word of the next line i have also changed from ears to breasts in order to elude the rhyme  o then his lines would ravish savage breasts and plant in tyrants mild humanity the text word is humility  i have ventured to change it to one that is more fitly opposed to tyranny  from womens eyes this doctrine i derive they sparkle still the right promethean fire they are the books the arts the academies that show contain and nourish all the world else none at all in aught proves excellent   act v scene iii that persons of the best understandings are generally remarked to be the greatest fools in love the superiority of their talents adding strength to their passion is well noted in the following observations which as doctor johnson says upon this passage are worthy of a man who has surveyed human nature with the closest attention  the princess rosaline and maria princess none are so surely caught when they are catched as wit turned fool folly in wisdom hatched has wisdoms warrant and the help of school and wits own grace to grace a learned fool  rosaline the blood of youth burns not in such excess as gravitys revolt to wantonness  maria folly in fools bears not so strong a note as fooery in the wise when wit does dote since all the power thereof it does apply to prove by wit worth in simplicity  these ladies seem to speak very philosophically upon this subject but might yet have improved their lecture by observing on as certain a fact still more extraordinary which is that to render a man of sense the compleatest slave in love he must be captivated by a fool provided she has what is generally met with in persons of that character a proper proportion of art or cunning  sense is always a match for sense and can be overreached by folly only as here no danger is apprehended to put a man on his guard the fair ones wiles seeming to be all nature naivete and charming simplicity and it is natural to humor those fondlings whom it is thought vain to reason with  scene x i shall finish my remarks on this play with a passage in this scene which continues the subject above last mentioned and is a further description of the nature and effects of that passion  biron to the ladies  for your fair sakes have we neglected time played foul play with our oaths your beauty ladies has much deformed us fashioning our humors even to the opposed end of our intents and what in us has seemed ridiculous as love is full of unbefitting strains all wanton as a child skipping in vain formed by the eye and therefore like the eye full of straying shapes of habits and of forms varying in subjects as the eye does roll to every fancied object in his glance with partycoated presence of loose love put on by us if in your heavenly eyes have misbecomed our oaths and gravities those heavenly eyes that look into those faults suggested us to make them the winters tale dramatis personae men leontes king of sicilia polixenes king of bohemia florizel prince of bohemia camillo sicilian lords cleomines sicilian lords another sicilian lord archidamus a bohemian lord a gentleman autolicus a sharper clown women hermione queen of sicilia perdita daughter to leontes and hermione paulina a lady of the sicilian court the winters tale act i scene i the rational sociable and friendly manner in which crowned heads used formerly to live pleasantly with one another is described here  why is it no longer so does modern polity oppose itself to humanity kings may have mistresses indeed but friend or favorite they must have none what amends can the whole regalia of their solitary pomp afford them for being denied one of the sweetest the dearest and the most virtuous enjoyments of life a manly sympathy of affections and a chaste intercourse of souls modern kings may say as richard the third did i am myself alone incedo solus but not in the happy sense that horace meant it  the quacunque libido est is wanting  camillo sicilia cannot show himself overkind to bohemia they were trained together in their childhoods and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection which cannot choose but branch now since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society their encounters though not personal have been royally attornied with interchange of gifts letters loving embassies that they have seemed to be together though absent shook hands as over a vast and embraced as it were from the ends of opposed winds the heavens continue their loves   archidamus i think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it   the passion in mankind for life and the pretenses they make to themselves for still wishing to defer their departure from time to time is well enough pointed out in the following passage  camillo speaking of the young prince of sicilia says  he makes old hearts fresh they that went on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a man  archidamus would they else be content to die   camillo yes if there were no other excuse why they should desire to live   archidamus if the king had no son they would desire to live on crutches till he had one   scene ii the happy state of youth and consequently of innocence is here well described polixenes we were fair queen two lads that thought there was no more behind but such a day tomorrow as today and to be boy eternal we were as twinned lambs that did frisk in the sun and bleat the one at the other what we changed was innocence for innocence we knew not the doctrine of illdoing no nor dreamed that any did  had we pursued that life and our weak spirits never been higher reared with stronger blood we should have answered heaven boldly not guilty the imposition cleared setting aside the fall of man  hereditary ours    scene iii when leontes having conceived a jealousy of polixenes commands camillo whom he had appointed cup bearer to his guest to poison him this good man makes an admirable reflection on disloyalty and rebellion in the following soliloquy camillo if i could find example of thousands that had struck anointed kings and flourished after i would not do it but since nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one let villainy itself forswear it    act ii scene iii the dumb rhetoric of innocence is finely noted here when paulina the queens friend purposes to present the newborn child of leontes before him in hopes of abating his resentment against its mother she says we do not know how he may soften at the sight of the child the silence often of pure innocence persuades when speaking fails   act iii scene ii the unhappy queen of sicilia when she is called upon her public trial for a supposed adultery speaks with a noble spirit of parental sentiment on the occasion  hermione behold me a fellow of the royal bed which owe for own  a moiety of the throne a great kings daughter the mother to a hopeful prince here standing to prate and talk for life and honor before who please to come and hear for life i prize it as i weigh grief which i would spare  for honor it is a derivative from me to mine and only that i stand for  the beautiful sentiment expressed in the last lines which must draw tears of pity from virtuous mothers and should those of another kind from vicious ones puts me in mind of a parallel passage in scripture  a mother in dishonor is a reproach to her children ecclesiasticus chapter iii verse      scenes iii and iv the sudden ebbs of warm and violent tempers with the revealing nature of a guilty conscience which is apt to confess its crime even before it is charged with it as leontes does here with regard to the intended murder of polixenes which remained yet a secret in his own breast are strongly depicted in this scene  leontes on hearing that his son had died of grief and seeing his wife fall into a swoon on that event is suddenly struck with compassion and remorse  leontes apollos angry and the heavens themselves do strike at my injustice  how now there  hermione faints paulina this news is mortal to the queen  look down and see what death is doing  leontes take her hence her heart is but oercharged she will recover exeunt paulina and ladies with hermione i have too much believed my own suspicion  beseech you tenderly apply to her some remedies for life apollo pardon my great profaneness against thy oracle which had vouched the innocence of hermione  i will reconcile me to polixenes new woo my queen recall the good camillo whom i proclaim a man of truth of mercy for being transported by my jealousies to bloody thoughts and to revenge i chose camillo for the minister to poison my friend polixenes which had been done but that the good mind of camillo tardied my swift command though i with death and with reward did threaten and encourage him not doing it and being done he most humane and filled with honor to my kingly guest unclasped my practice quit his fortunes here which you knew great and to the certain hazard of all incertainties himself commended no richer than his honor  now he glisters through my dark rust and now his piety does my deeds make the blacker  scene v paulina too being likewise a person of strong passions and an ungovernable temper shows as quick a revulsion in the midst of her rage against leontes upon finding him repentant though she had even told him the moment before that neither penance nor penitence itself could aught avail him lord say no more however the business goes you have made fault in the boldness of your speech this fault is reprehended before by gonzalez in the tempest act i scene i see the second speech there in this work   paulina i am sorry for it all faults i make when i shall come to know them i do repent  alas i have showed too much the rashness of a woman he is touched to the nobler heart what is gone and what is past help should be past grief do not receive affliction at my petition i beseech you rather let me be punished that have minded you of what you should forget now good my liege sir royal sir forgive a foolish woman the love i bore your queen  lo fool again i will speak of her no more  nor of your children  i will not remember you of my own lord who is lost too  sake you your patience to you and i will say nothing  though i cannot help observing here that her vindictive spirit appears plainly not to have yet subsided but only taken a different course by the latter part of her speech for she continues still to accumulate her charges against him as if only by way of enumerating the articles of her forgiveness  our author who almost every where manifests a perfect knowledge in the anatomy of the human mind proves his science more particularly in a passage of this scene by showing a property in our natures which might have escaped any common dissecter of morals and this is our suffering upon true penitence and contrition not only all reproach thrown out against us with meekness and submission but even encouraging and augmenting the abuse by joining in our own condemnation this may possibly arise from a strong wish or sanguine hope that such a voluntary penance may in part be accepted both by heaven and the world as some sort of atonement for our crimes  leontes while paulina is arraigning him with the utmost virulence and severity instead of having her cast out from his presence cries go on go on  thou can not speak too much i have deserved all tongues to talk their bitterest   again when she seems to relent of her severity toward him thou did say but well when most the truth which i receive much better than to be pitied of thee prithee bring me to the dead bodies of my queen and son one grave shall be for both upon them shall the causes of their deaths appear unto our shame perpetual once a day i will visit the chapel where they lie and tears shed there shall be my recreation so long as nature will bear up with this exercise so long i daily vow to use it come and lead me to these sorrows   in the first scene of the fifth act the same subject is renewed where leontes manifests the same humiliation and contrition for his crime that he did before but as an interval of sixteen years spent in sorrow and repentance had passed between these two aeras he as would be natural then shows an uneasiness at the reproach and entreats to be relieved from it for the future but this in a manner so gentle and submissive as none but shakespeare himself could have conceived the whole passage is worthy of being quoted  leontes cleomines and paulina cleomines sir you have done enough and have performed a saintlike sorrow no fault you could make which you have not redeemed indeed paid down more penitence than done trespass at the last do as the heavens have done forget your evil with them forgive yourself  leontes whilst i remember her and her virtues i cannot forget my blemishes in them and so still think of the wrong i did myself which was so much that heirless it has made my kingdom and destroyed the sweetst companion that ever man bred his hopes out of  paulina true too true my lord if one by one you wedded all the world or from the all that are took something good to make a perfect woman she you killed would be unparalleled  leontes i think so killed killed she i killed i did so  but thou strikst me sorely to say i did  it is as bitter upon thy tongue as in my thought now good now say so but seldom  act iv scene iv there is a poetical history of love given here which closes with a beautiful description of a chaste and pure passion in a lover  florizel the gods themselves humbling their deities to love have taken the shapes of beasts upon them jupiter became a bull and bellowed the green neptune a ram and bleated and the firerobed god golden apollo a poor humble swain as i seem now their transformations were never for a piece of beauty rarer nor in a way so chaste since my desires run not before mine honor nor my lusts burn hotter than my faith  scene v here is a passage that i am particularly fond of because it vindicates the rights of nature even over those arts which seem to vie and cooperate with her for her general laws can never be controlled but by bye ones of her own making  perdita and polixenes perdita the fairest flowers of the season are our carnations and streaked gillyflowers which some call natures bastards of that kind our rustic gardens barren and i care not to get slips of them  polixenes and wherefore gentle maiden do you neglect them  perdita for i have heard it said there is an art which in their piedness shares with great creating nature i have been told that different colored silk threads inserted in the roots would have this effect   polixenes say there be yet nature is made better by no mean but nature makes that mean so over that art which you say adds to nature is an art that nature makes you see sweet maid we marry a gentler scyon to the wildest stock and make conceive a bark of baser kind by bud of nobler race this is an art which does mend nature  change it rather  but the art itself is nature  perdita so it is  polixenes then make your garden rich in gillyflowers and do not call them bastards  perdita i will not put the dibble a setting stick in earth to set one slip of them no more than were i painted i would wish this florizel standing by youth should say twere well and only therefore desire to breed by me  i have continued the above dialogue beyond the philosophy of its subject in order to treat my reader with one of the most refined sentiments of a chaste and delicate mind that can possibly be conceived perdita shows a charming genuineness of nature in her latter speech for though she confesses the truth of polixenes position yet is she so jealous of the honor of our great parent that even the appearance of a violation against her rights offends her and the parallel she makes upon the occasion is beautiful readers see not half the greatness of shakespeare who overlook his minutiae  in the same scene the praise that florizel bestows on perdita is equally fond and beautiful  what you do still betters what is done when you speak sweet i would have you do it ever when you sing i would have you buy and sell so so give alms pray so and for the ordring your affairs to sing them too when you do dance i wish you a wave of the sea that you might ever do nothing but that move still still so and own no other function each your doing so singular in each particular crowns what your doing in the present deeds that all your acts are queens to which she replies with very good sense and prudence o doricles your praises are too large but that your youth and the true blood which peeps forth fairly through it do plainly give you out an unstained shepherd with wisdom i might fear my doricles you wooed me the false way   in answer to this he says i think you have as little skill to fear as little skill to fear  as little suspicion in your nature  as i have purpose to put you to it   this is the true character of youth in the different sexes sincerity on one side and confidence on the other deceit and diffidence are the fruits of riper or more rotten years  scene ix there is a reflection made here which if true would be one of the heaviest articles of affliction  camillo and perdita camillo prosperitys the very bond of love whose fresh complexion and whose heart together affliction alters  but i shall rather hope and believe with the charming perdita in the faith and fidelity she expresses in her reply one of these is true i think affliction may subdue the cheek but not take in the mind   scene xi there is a good ridicule here on the affectations of persons of rank in the description of the manners by which the vulgar often distinguish their betters  perhaps their superiors only  the old shepherd and his son upon seeing autolicus the sharper dressed up in a suit of the princes clothes debate thus about him son this cannot be but a great courtier   shepherd his garments are rich but he wears them not handsomely   son he seems to be the more noble in being fantastical a great man i will warrant i know by the picking of his teeth     act v scene i there is a good remark made here on the wrong timing of reproof in the speech of cleomines to paulina upon her rough treatment of leontes on the subject of his misfortunes when she is dissuading him from marrying  you might have spoke a thousand things that would have done the time more benefit and graced your kindness better scene v this comedy is full of welldescribed character and beautiful description but these not happening to fall within the scope i had prescribed to myself in this work i have reluctantly passed them by without noting however there is one passage among them which luckily affords me a proper subject of remark in the account given of leontes and camillo on their being certified of the preservation of perdita  autolicus and a gentleman autolicus beseech you sir were you present at this relation   gentleman i was by at the opening of the fardel and heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it whereupon after a little amazedness we were all commanded out of the chamber only this methought i heard the shepherd say he found the child   autolicus i would most gladly know the issue of it   gentleman i make a broken delivery of the business but the changes i perceived in the king and camillo were very notes of admiration they seemed almost with staring on one another to tear the cases of their eyes there was a speech in their dumbness language in their very gesture they looked as they had heard of a world ransomed or one destroyed a notable passion of wonder appeared in them but the wisest beholder that knew no more but seeing could not say if the importance were joy or sorrow but in the extremity of the one it must needs be   this description not only contains the beautiful and the sublime but rises to a still higher sublimity or to speak in the style of the psalmist to the most highest in the allusion to sacred writ relating to the two principal articles in the old and new testament the fall of man and his redemption shakespeare makes frequent references to the sacred text and writes often not only as a moralist but as a divine  autolicus having by accident had some hand in bringing about the discovery of perdita which was a circumstance that might have been sufficient to make another mans fortune makes only this sad soliloquy upon the occasion now had i not the dash of my former life in me would preferment drop on my head i brought the old man and his son aboard the prince told him i heard them talk of a fardel and i know not what but he at that time overfond of the shepherds daughter so he then took her to be who began to be much seasick and himself little better extremity of weather continuing this mystery remained undiscovered but it is all one to me for had i been the finder out of this secret it would not have relished among my other discredits  that honesty is the best policy is a homely proverb but this only the more vouches the truth of it by its having stood the test of all experience character is the immediate jewel of the soul not only in its own worth but even in the temporal advantages which frequently accrue from it lost health may be repaired lost fortune be regained even lost senses may be recovered but a forfeited character is rarely ever to be retrieved  this is a theme which cannot be too largely or too frequently expatiated upon which i hope will serve as my apology for having taken the hint from so mean and trifling an instance as the foregoing  scene vi the old shepherd and his son having by the medium of the princess perdita obtained into favor at court autolicus asks forgiveness of the clown for the tricks he had played him i humbly beseech you sir to pardon me all the faults i have committed to your worship and to give me your good report to the prince my master this request is seconded by the old man in words which describe the proper character of that rank of life to which he had been just elevated  shpherd prithee son do for we must be gentle now we are gentlemen   but it is pity that the conduct and behavior of too many in so respectable a class should afford cause for the severe sarcasm couched in the following words of the son clown give me thy hand to autolicus  i will swear to the prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in bohemia   shepherd you may say it but not swear it   clown not swear it now i am a gentleman let boors and franklins yeemen say it i will swear it   shepherd how if it be false son   clown if it be never so false a true gentleman may swear it on the behalf of his friend     scene vii paulina says to leontes on perceiving him to be strongly affected on seeing hermione represented so much to the life as a supposed statue i am sorry sir i have thus far stirred you but i could afflict you further   to which he replies do paulina for this affliction has a taste as sweet as any cordial comfort   this is spoken with a true sense of a propitiatory and a contrite grief a sincere repentance is indeed an healing balm to the wounded conscience a cordial comfort to the soul  twelfth night or what you will dramatis personae men duke of illyria sebastian brother to viola antonio friend to sebastian valentine an attendant on the duke clown servant to olivia women olivia beloved by the duke viola in love with the duke twelfth night or what you will act i scene i this play opens with a sweet passage in which the charms of music and the nature of love are beautifully described  duke if music be the food of love play on give me excess of it that surfeiting the appetite may sicken and so die that strain again  it had a dying fall  o it came over my ear like the sweet south that breathes upon a bank of violets stealing and giving odor enough no more  it is not so sweet now as it was before o spirit of love how quick and fresh art thou that notwithstanding thy capacity receives as the sea naught enters there of what validity and pitch soever but falls into abatement and low price even in a minute so full of shapes in fancy that it alone is hight hight yeleped or called instead of high warburton fantastical  as i have hitherto observed upon shakespeares critical knowledge in human nature i hope it will not appear invidious now if i should here remark upon his deficiency in a passage above  lines second and third the duke is there made to wish his passion were extinct which i believe the most unhappy lover never yet did we wish to remove every uneasy sensation it afflicts us with by any means whatever sometimes even by death itself but never by the extinction of the affection  this is not peculiar to love alone it is the same in all the tender feelings we wish the object of our grief brought back again to life but desire not to forget our sorrow we wish to relieve the subjects of our pity but would not be deprived of our compassion heaven has so framed us and heaven be praised for having endowed and adorned us with such sweet compunctious visitings of nature it is in these features only that we can resemble our maker in the more heroic qualities of bravery and fortitude can be traced no likeness of the deity because superfluous in a perfect state the subject of love is touched upon again twice in the same scene duke o when my eyes did see olivia first methouht she purged the air of pestilence that instant was i turned into a heart and my desires like fell and cruel hounds ever since pursue me a fine allusion to the story of acton and a beautiful exposition of the sable   and when valentine acquaints the duke with olivias vow of sequestering herself from the world for seven years to mourn the death of her brother he cries out in an ecstasy o she that has an heart of that fine frame to pay this debt of love but to a brother how will she love when the rich golden shaft has killed the flock of all affections else that live in her when liver brain and heart three sovereign thrones are all supplied and filled o sweet perfection with one selfsame king   i am happy that this latter passage happens to occur so immediately after my remark above as it affords me an opportunity of doing justice to shakespeare by observing that his inference from olivias grief to the nature of her heart in love shows a perfect knowledge in this species of philosophy the passions are divided into but two classes the tender and the violent and any one of either affords an earnest of all others of the same kind  his distinction too of the three thrones the liver brain and heart is admirable these are truly the seats of the three chief affections of love the heart for passion the mind for esteem and the liver for jealousy if horaces anatomy is to be credited diffh be tu jer   scene xi in the last speech of this act olivia speaks in the usual manner of all infatuated persons who are apt to make the fates answerable for those follies or vices which they have not sense or virtue enough to extricate themselves from by their own exertions for upon a consciousness of having too weakly betrayed her passion for viola appearing under the character of a cavalier she acquiesces in her indiscretion by saying i do i know not what  and fear to find mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind that my eye has revealed a secret which my mind should have concealed johnson  fate show thy force ourselves we do not owe for own or are masters of  what is decreed must be  and this be so she repeats the same idle apology for herself again in the second scene of the next act for such as we are made if such we be alas our frailty is the cause not we   act ii scene vi there are some good rules and reflections here upon that principal and interesting event of life our marriage which are well worth attending to as the natural consequences of an improper assortment in that state have been too strongly marked by the general experience of the world  duke and viola as a man duke let still the woman take an elder than herself so wears she to him so sways she level in her husbands heart for boy however we do prize ourselves our fancies are more giddy and unfirm more longing wavering sooner lost and won than womens are  viola i think it well my lord  duke then let thy love be younger than thyself or thy affection cannot hold the bent for women are as roses whose fair flower being once displayed does fall that very hour  viola and so they are  alas that they are so  to die even when they to perfection grow  act iii scene i there is a slight stroke thrown out here against an affected refinement on

have forgotten  antonio and viola will you deny me now is it possible that my deserts to you can lack persuasion do not tempt my misery lest that it make me so unsound a man as to upbraid you with thse kindnesses that i have done for you to which the innocent and mistaken viola replies with a becoming spirit of conscious virtue i hate ingratitude more in a man than lying vainness babbling drunkenness or any taint of vice whose strong corruption inhabits our frail blood   there is an ancient adage which says that the sin of ingratitude includes every vice ingratum fi dixeris omnia dixeris  it renders us unworthy of all the goods and enjoyments of life even of our very existence for we owe them all to favor and benevolence religion and virtue are therefore but barely the acknowledging a debt which must ever remain undischarged  all the moral i have been able to extract from this piece concludes in this scene with a position which it were devoutly to be wished had as much truth in physics as it has in philosophy that the outward form is but the visible sign of the internal mind  antonio thou have sebastian done good feature shame  in nature there is no blemish but the mind none can be called deformed but the unkind virtue is beauty but the beauteous evil are empty trunks oerflourished by the devil  i shall here give a quotation from a modern dramatic poem of distinguished merit as the passage relates so immediately to the subject above last mentioned  beauty and virtue are the same they differ only in the name what to the soul is pure and bright is beauty in a moral light and what to sense does charms convey is beauty in the natural way each from one source its essence draws and both conform to natures laws socrates the merry wives of windsor dramatis personae men sir john falstaff mr ford fenton in love with anne page women anne page in love with fenton the merry wives of windsor this is one of the best acting comedies of shakespeare and is replete with character humor and incident but supplies very little toward the purpose of this work however whatever there is has a right to class with the rest so i shall proceed to take it in its course  act ii scene i upon mrs pages reading falstaffs loveletter to her she makes the following reflection what unweighed behavior has this flemish drunkard picked in the devils name out of my conversation that he dares in this manner essay me why he has not been thrice in my company  what should i say to him i was then frugal of my mirth  and in the next scene on communicating this adventure to mrs ford she recurs to the same thought again  nay i know not  it makes me almost ready to wrangle with mine own honesty i will entertain myself like one that i am not acquainted withal for sure unless he knew some stain in me that i know not myself he would never have boarded me in this fury this is a very natural sentiment for a delicate mind to conceive upon meeting with an affront of this sort and it is extremely proper upon all such occasions to enter into such a selfexamination by way of inquiring what part of our own conduct or unweighed behavior as she expresses it might have encouraged the offense and upon an impartial scrutiny we shall generally find that it is more our indiscretion than our charms which prompts the attack  scene ix to preserve a charity in

same reason because none of them answer the end but the getting rid of it for the old proverb still stands bluff against all such documents that every man can cure a scold but he who has her  the introduction scene iii among the preparations which are making in order to deceive the drunken tinker into the notion of his having been a mad lord just recovering his senses some strollers are introduced to perform a play for his entertainment and the actors meaning to exhibit one of the old religious farces styled the mysteries upon enumerating the properties necessary toward the representation ask for a little vinegar to make their devil roar upon which passage dr warburton gives the following note  when the acting the mysteries of the old and new testament was in vogue at the representation of the mystery of the passion judas and the devil made a part and the devil wherever he came was always to suffer some disgrace to make the people laugh as here the buffoonery was to apply the gall and vinegar to make him roar and the passion being that of all the mysteries which was most frequently represented vinegar became at length the standing implement to torment the devil and used for this purpose even after the mysteries ceased and the moralities certain allegorical pieces where the virtues and vices were personified which succeeded to the stage upon the prohibition of the former came in vogue where the devil still continued to bear a considerable part the mention of it here was designed to ridicule so absurd a circumstance in these old farces  the giving such theatrical representations of sacred writ was rather something more than barely absurd it was extremely profane but the device of tormenting the devil with gall and vinegar had a mystic conceit in it being certainly intended by the authors of these exhibitions as an allusion to a circumstance in the passion mentioned by st matthew where he says they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall chap xxvii ver    and as the sufferings on the cross were undergone for our redemption from sin the priests who were the contrivers of this strange and improper species of drama might have intended this particular to show the distress of the devil upon that occasion  act i scene i the proper use and choice of travel and study of such sort of travel and study as rendered so many men

though her father be very rich any man is so very a fool to be married to hell   hortensio tush gremio though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarms why man there be good fellows in the world an a man could light on them would take her with all her faults and money enough   scene iv love conceived at first sight is the subject of most romances and the philosophy of these northern climes looks for it only there but if we consult the volume of nature more at large we shall find that such extempore passions are not infrequent in the more southern regions of the world and the clear and warm air of italy communicates a brisker motion to the heart and spirits than our natural phlegm can possibly be sensible of  tranio upon perceiving the emotion of lucentio on his first view of bianca says to him i pray you sir tell me is it possible that love should on a sudden take such hold lucentio o tranio till i found it to be true i never thought it possible or likely but see while

illustrated here by the following simile petruchio though little fire grows great with little wind yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all    act iv scene viii among the various methods that petruchio makes use of after his marriage with catharine to tame her spirit the following passage presents us with one which the satirists of our sex will be apt to say was a severe test of female temper  catharine petruchio milliner and mantuamaker milliner here is the cap your worship did bespeak  petruchio why this was molded on a porringer a velvet dish fie fie it is lewd and filthy  why it is a cockle or a walnutshell a knack a toy a trick a babys cap away with it come let me have a bigger  catharine i will have no bigger this does fit the time is fashionable  and gentlewomen wear such caps as these  petruchio when you are gentle you shall have one too and not till then  catharine why sir i trust i may have leave to speak and speak i will i am no child no babe your betters have endured me say my mind and if you cannot best you stop your ears  my tongue will tell the anger of my heart or else my heart concealing it will break and rather than it shall i will be free even to the utmost as i please in words  petruchio why thou say true it is a paltry cap a custard coffin a bauble a silken pie i love thee well in that thou like it not  catharine love me or love me not i like the cap and i will have it or i will have none  petruchio the gown  why ay  come tailor let us see it  o mercy heaven what masking stuff is here what this a sleeve it is like a demicannon  what ups and downs carved like an appletart here is snip and snip and slish and slash like to a censer in a barbers shop  why what a devils name tailor callst thou this  mantuamaker you bid me make it orderly and well according to the fashion of the time  catharine i never saw a better fashioned gown more quaint more pleasing nor more commendable  belike you mean to make a puppet of me  upon this passage doctor warburton has passed the following stricture  shakespeare has here copied nature with great skill petruchio by frightening starving and overwatching his wife had tamed her into gentleness and submission and the audience expects to hear no more of the shrew when on her being crossed in the article of fashion and finery the most inveterate folly of the sex she flies out again though for the last time into all the intemperate rage of her character  this is being severe on our sex at a very cheap rate indeed foibles passions and inconsiderable attachments are equally common to all mankind without distinction of gender and the difference of objects gives no sort of advantage to men over us as all eager pursuits except those of virtue are alike ridiculous and unimportant in the candid and impartial estimation of reason and philosophy another florio doting on a flower young  petruchio having gained a conquest in this material point proceeds to dress her and himself in poor attire and proposes that they should go pay a visit to her family in such mean garments upon which occasion he expresses a sentiment so just in itself that it betrays a sad corruption in the morals of mankind that experience cannot support it  petruchio well come my kate we will unto your fathers even in these honest mean habiliments our purses shall be proud our garments poor for it is the mind that makes the body rich and as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds so honor peereth in the meanest habit what is the jay more precious than the lark because his feathers are more beautiful or is the adder better than the eel because his painted skin contents the eye oh no good kate neither art thou the worse for this poor furniture and mean array  act v scene v after catharine has been thoroughly reclaimed she takes an occasion from a circumstance in the play of reproving another married woman in an admirable speech wherein the description of a wayward wife with the duty and submission which ought to be shown to a husband are finely set forth  fie fie unknit that threatening unkind brow and dart not scornful glances from those eyes to wound thy lord thy king thy governor it blots thy beauty as frosts bite the meads confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds and in no sense is meet or amiable a woman moved is like a fountain troubled muddy illseeming thick bereft of beauty and while it is so none so dry or thirsty will deign to sip or touch one drop of it thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee and for thy maintenance commits his body to painful labor both by sea and land to watch the night in storms the day in cold while thou lie warm at home secure and safe and craves no other tribute at thy hands but love fair looks and true obedience too little payment for so great a debt such duty as the subject owes the prince even such a woman owes to her husband and when she is froward peevish sullen sour and not obedient to his honest will what is she but a foul contending rebel and graceless traitor to her loving lord i am ashamed that women are so simple to offer war where they should kneel for peace or seek for rule supremacy and sway when they are bound to serve love and obey why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth unapt to toil and trouble in the world but that our soft conditions and our hearts should well agree with our external parts come come you froward and unable worms my mind has been as big as one of yours my heart as great my reason happily more to bandy word for word and frown for frown but now i see our lances are but straws our strength as weak our weakness past compare that seeming to be most which we indeed least are i have stopped short here as thinking that the following lines might have marred the whole beauty of the speech the doctrine of passive obedience and nonresistance in the state of marriage being there carried perhaps rather a little too far but i shall quote them here as they afford me an opportunity of remarking on the nature of too prompt reformees who are apt to run into the very contrary extreme at once betraying more of the timeserver than the convert  but in general indeed it has been observed that the most haughty tyrants become on a reverse of fortune the most abject slaves and this from a like principle in both cases that they are apt to impute the same spirit of despotism to the conqueror they were before impressed with themselves and consequently are brought to tremble at the apprehension of their own vice  the lines i allude to are these then vail your stomachs for it is no boot and place your hands beneath your husbands foot in token of which duty if he please my hand is ready may it do him ease to vail is to submit to be awed by authority    the comedy of errors dramatis personae men antipholis balthazar women an abbess adriana wife to antipholis luciana her sister the comedy of errors act ii scene i the first passage that i find worthy of being noted in this play happens to be a repetition of the same moral which concluded my remarks on the last piece but as this hint cannot be too often repeated i shall supply the quotation though it may be needless to make any further observations upon the subject  adriana and luciana adriana neither my husband nor the slave returned that in such haste i sent to seek his master sure luciana it is two oclock  luciana perhaps some merchant has invited him and from the mart he is somewhere gone to dinner good sister let us dine and never fret a man is master of his liberty  time is their master and when they see time they will go or come if so be patient sister  adriana why should their liberty than ours be more  luciana because their business still lies out adoor  adriana look when i serve him so he takes it ill  luciana o know he is the bridle of your will  adriana there is none but asses will be bridled so  luciana why headstrong liberty is lashed with woe there is nothing situate under heavens eye but has its bound on earth in sea or sky the beasts the fishes and the winged fowls are their males subjects and at their controuls man more divine the master of all these lord of the wide world and wide watery seas endued with intellectual sense and soul of more preeminence than fish or fowl are masters to their females and their lords then let your will attend on their accords  adriana this servitude makes you to keep unwed  luciana not this but troubles of the marriage bed  adriana but were you wedded you would bear some sway  luciana ere i learn love i will practice to obey  in the continuation of the same dialogue where luciana preaches patience to her sister adriana points out to her very naturally the great difference between giving and taking of advice  adriana patience unmoved  no marvel though she pause pause  acquiesces or submits johnson  they can be meek who have no other cause a wretched soul bruised with adversity we bid be quiet when we hear it cry but were we burdened with like weight of pain as much or more we should ourselves complain so thou that have no unkind mate to grieve thee with urging helpless patience would relieve me but if thou live to see like right bereft this foobegged alding to the law term of begging the guardianship of an idiot  ditto patience in thee will be left  act iii scene i in a passage here there is a sentiment of great propriety and delicacy argued upon in the dissuading a person from the commission of an unseemly action even though the thing itself might be sufficiently justified in ones own breast a respect to decency and the opinion of the world is an excellent bulwark to our virtues  when antipholis upon being denied admittance into his house from a mistake in his wife and domestics is in resentment preparing to force open the door his friend entreats his forbearance in the following words balthazar be ruled by me depart in patience and let us to the tiger a tavern so called from the sign all to dinner and about evening  me yourself alone to know the reason of this strange restraint if by strong hand you offer to break in now in the stirring passage of the day a vulgar comment will be made of it and that supposed by the common rout that is the world will be apt to frame suppositions etc  against your yet ungalled estimation that may with foul intrusion enter in and dwell upon your grave when you are dead for slander lives upon succession for ever housed where once it gets possession    prior speaks very refinedly on the same nice subject beyond the fixed and settled rules of vice and virtue in the schools above the letter of the law which holds our men and maids in awe the better sort should set before em a grace a manner a decorum something that gives their acts a light makes them not only just but bright and sets them in that open fame which witty malice cannot blame   act v scene ii there are some excellent documents for wives laid down in this place upon the following occasion  antipholis in this comedy of errors being supposed to be out of his senses takes sanctuary in a priory to screen himself from adriana and her friends who attempt to seize him and the abbess coming forth to forbid their entrance first artfully draws a confession from adriana of her manners and conduct toward her husband upon her having conceived some jealousy of him and then proceeds to infer the cause of his distraction from her behavior  abbess has he not lost much wealth by wreck at sea buried some dear friend has not else his eye strayed his affection in unlawful love a sin prevailing much in youthful men who give their eyes the liberty of gazing which of these sorrows is he subject to  adriana to none of these except it be the last namely some love that drew him often from home  abbess you should for that have reprehended him  adriana why so i did  abbess ay but not rough enough  adriana as roughly as my modesty would let me  abbess happily in private  adriana and in assemblies too  abbess ay but not enough  adriana it was the copy of our conference in bed he slept not for my urging it at board he fed not for my urging it alone it was the subject of my theme in company i often glanced at it still did i tell him it was vile and bad  abbess and therefore came it that the man was mad  the venom clamours of a jealous woman poison more deadly than a mad dogs tooth it seems his sleeps were hindered by thy railing and therefore comes it that his head is light thou say his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings unquiet meals make ill digestions therefore the raging fire of fever bred and what is a fever but a fit of madness thou say his sports were hindered by thy brawls  sweet recreation barred what does ensue but moody and dull melancholy kinsman to grim and comfortless despair and at its heels a huge infectious troop of pale distemperatures and foes to life in food in sport and life preserving rest to be disturbed would mad or man or beast the consequence is then thy jealous fits have scared thy husband from the use of s wits  much ado about nothing dramatis personae men leonato governor of messina antonio his brother don pedro prince of arragon claudio his friend don john bastard brother to don pedro conrade his friend benedick a young lord a marriagehater a friar a messenger women hero daughter to leonato beatrice niece to leonato much ado about nothing act i scene i leonato and messenger a messenger from the camp telling leonato of his having given an account of the gallant behavior of claudio to his uncle says i have already delivered him letters and there appears much joy in him  even so much that joy could not show itself modest enough without a badge of bitterness  upon this passage doctor warburton has given a note so full and ingenious that it would be presumption in me to offer my comment on it in any other sense or words than his own  this is judiciously expressed  of all the transports of joy that which is attended with tears is the least offensive because carrying with it this mark of pain it allays the envy that usually attends anothers happiness this he finely calls a modest joy such a one as did not insult the observer by an indication of happiness unmixed with pain  act ii scene i physiognomists say that the features of the mind usually mark their impressions on the countenance a mirthful or melancholy aspect a wanton or malicious one in fine every characteristic trait of visage throughout denote their correspondent passions or affections in the soul socrates acknowledged the certainty of this science by confessing a description of himself to be true as to his nature though false regarding his character  according to this piece of philosophy a person of a severe and saturnine complexion is humorously described in this place  beatrice how tartly that gentleman looks i never can see him but i am heartburned an hour after   from hence this lively girl proceeds to draw a contrast between him and another person of a contrary disposition very justly censuring both of the extremes he were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and benedick the one is too like an image and says nothing and the other too much like my ladys eldest son evermore tattling  scene iii the absolute dominion which love is found to usurp not only over our passions but our very principles is too justly described in a passage here which may lead one to pronounce that neither man or woman can truly boast a friend whom they have not had an occasion of first trying as a rival  claudio friendship is constant in all other things save in the office and affairs of love therefore all hearts in love use their own tongues use their own tongues for let use  let every eye negotiate for itself and trust no agent beauty is a witch against whose charms faith melts into blood  this is an accident accident for article of hourly proof  scene v the effect of strong passion in the prevention of utterance is well expressed here claudio silence is the perfectest herald of joy  i were but little happy if i could say how much     scene viii the total metamorphosis of character manners and disposition wrought in us by love is well described in a speech in this scene benedick i do much wonder that one man seeing how much another man is a fool when he dedicates his behavior to love will after he has laughed at such shallow follies in others become the argument of his own scorn by falling himself in love and such a man is claudio i have known when there was no music with him but the drum and the fife and now had he rather hear the tabor and the pipe i have known when he would have walked ten miles a foot to see a good armor and now will he lie ten nights awake carving the fashion of a new doublet he was wont to speak plain and to the purpose like an honest man and a soldier and now is he turned orthographer his words are a very fantastical banquet just so many strange dishes     from these reflections benedick goes on holding a debate with himself upon this subject and like most people before their hearts have become a party in the matter draws a vain portrait of the peerless paragon who only can be capable of triumphing over his affections leaving nothing in the choice of his mistress to heaven itself except the color of her hair  may i be so converted and see with these eyes i cannot tell i think not i will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster but i will take my oath that till he have made one of me he shall never make me such a fool one woman is fair yet i am well another is wise yet i am well another virtuous yet i am well but till all graces meet in one woman one woman shall not come in my grace rich she shall be that is certain wise or i will none virtuous or i will never cheapen her fair or i will never look on her mild or come not near me noble or not i for an angel of good discourse an excellent musician and her hair shall be of what color it please god scene ix modesty is as sure an attendant on merit as its companion as envy is as its shade envy does merit as its shade pursue and like its shadow proves the substance too pope   pedro it is the witness still of excellency to put a strange face on its own perfection  in the same scene don pedro speaking of benedick says the man does fear god howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests he will make  this is too common a character in life of persons who scoff at religion with as much fear and trembling as would be sufficient to work out their salvation the whole of infidelity is owing to a foolhardy disposition of this sort the strongest deists are but skeptics and the atheist no more than a deist in reality nay often as pope humorously expresses it on another occasion may be a sad good christian in his heart  scene x the scheme for inducing benedick and beatrice to fall in love with each other which is commenced with him in the preceding scene and concluded with her in the first one of the third act is most admirably laid the surest method that artifice can contrive to inspire a passion in any one is by giving them a notion of the other partys predilection for them for as hero says to ursula in the plot on beatrice let it be thy part to praise him more than ever man did merit my talk to thee must be how benedick is sick in love with beatrice of such matter is little cupids crafty arrow made that often wounds by hearsay act iii scene i  and again if it prove so then loving goes by haps some cupids kill with arrows some with traps ditto  when every other circumstance of years of rank and fortune happens to be on a par such arts may perhaps be allowed to pass under the title of pious frauds at least for gratitude is a good cement of affections as it serves to confirm passion by principle  the readiness with which we are apt to run into the snare ourselves with the kind of logic we use in order to make a sudden resolve appear a deliberate purpose may be seen displayed in the soliloquy of benedick just after don pedro claudio and leonato had played off their part against him as supposing him not to be within hearing  benedick advancing from the arbor this can be no trick the conference was sadly sadly for gravely or seriously borne they have the truth of this from hero they seem to pity the lady it seems her affections have the full bent love me why it must be requited  i hear how i am censured they say i will bear myself proudly if i perceive the love to come from her they say too that she will rather die than give any sign of affection  i did never think to marry  i must not seem proud  happy are they that hear their detractions and can put them to mending they say the lady is fair it is a truth i can bear them witness  and virtuous  it is so i cannot reprove it  and wise  but for loving me  by my troth it is no addition to her wit  nor no great argument of her folly neither for i will be horribly in love with her  i may chance to have some odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me because i have railed so long against marriage but does not the appetite alter a man loves the meat in his youth that he cannot endure in his age shall quips and sentences these paper bullets of the brain awe a man from the career of his humor no  the world must be peopled  when i said i would die a bachelor i did not think i should live till i were married here comes beatrice by this day she is a fair lady  i do spy some marks of love in her  the speech of beatrice also in the first scene of the third act has a right to take place here though somewhat before its time as a companion to the preceding  beatrice advancing after hero and ursula had quitted the scene what fire is in my ears can this be true stand i condemned for pride and scorn so much contempt farewell and maiden pride adieu no glory lives behind the back of such and benedick love on i will requite thee taming my wild heart to thy loving hand if thou do love thy fondness shall incite thee to bind our loves up in a holy band for others say thou do deserve and i believe it better than reportingly   act iii scene i a most unamiable character of pride and selfconceit is given in this place which falls very properly within the moral tendency of these notes to expose to view though it is only spoken in consequence of the plot against beatrice  hero but nature never framed a womans heart of prouder stuff than that of beatrice disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes misprizing what they look on and her wit values itself so highly that to her all matter else seems weak she cannot love nor take no shape nor project of affection she is so selfindeared  the same character is continued in the same scene with the addition of a satirical vein which is extremely well and humorously described hero i never yet saw man how wise how noble young how rarely featured but she would spell him backward  if fairfaced she would swear the gentleman should be her sister if black why nature drawing of an antic a harlequin  made a foul blot if tall a lance illheaded if low an aglet aglts were little images made use of as tags to be suspended at the points of the old fashioned laced cravats somewhat like those the roman catholics king at the bottom of their rosaries very vilely cut if speaking why a vane blown with all winds if silent then a block moved by none so turns she every man the wrong side out and never gives to truth and virtue that which simpleness and merit purchases    hero in the same scene pretending to lay a scheme with ursula for curing benedick of his supposed passion for beatrice while she is listening says no rather i will go to benedick and counsel him to fight against his passion and truly i will devise some honest slanders to stain my cousin with  one does not know how such an ill word may impoison liking   the success of such a wicked device i have already remarked on in a passage of the two gentlemen of verona act third and scene fifth  the best way is to slander valentine etc and i shall therefore make no further note on the subject here  i have not been so much an oeconomist in other places where the recurring of similar topics afforded me opportunities of saving myself trouble by references but this one is so very irksome a theme that it disgusts me to dwell upon it for a moment for which reason should i happen to meet with it again in the course of this work i shall pass it by unnoticed for the future  act iv scene ii hero being falsely accused of an act of dishonor is examined before her father her lover and a friar with other friends who had all met together in a convent to attend her nuptials and the bitterness of a parents anguish and resentment on so trying an occasion is most feelingly expressed in the following speech leonato to his daughter on her fainting do not live hero do not open thy eyes for did i think thou would not quickly die thought i thy spirits were stronger than thy shames myself would on the rereward of reproaches strike at thy life grieved i i had but one chid i for that at frugal natures frame i have one too much by thee why had i one why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes why had i not with charitable hand taken up a beggars issue at my gates who smeared thus and mired with infamy i might have said no part of it is mine this shame derives itself from unknown loins but mine and mine i loved and mine i praised and mine that i was proud of mine so much that i myself was to myself not mine valuing of her why she  o she is fallen into a pit of ink that the wide sea has drops too few to wash her clean again and salt too little which may season give to her foul tainted flesh   upon this occasion the good friar with that charity and humanity which so well become the sacred office of priesthood and from that observation which his long experience in the business of auricular confession had enabled him to form stands forth an advocate for heros innocence in the following poetical and philosophical oration hear me a little for i have only silent been so long and given way into this course of fortune by noting of the lady i have marked a thousand blushing apparitions to start into her face a thousand innocent shame in angel whiteness bear away those blushes and in her eye there has appeared a fire to burn the errors that these princes who were her accusers hold against her maiden truth  call me a fool trust not my reading nor my observations which with experimental seal do warrant the tenor of my book i do not comprehend the meaning of this expression unless it be allowed to be figurative of his art science or knowledge in physognemy  trust not my age my reverence calling nor divinity if this sweet lady lie not guiltless here under some biting error   but a little after this good casuist asks her suddenly this trying question lady what man is he you are accused of upon which passage doctor warburton makes the following judicious remark  the friar had just before boasted his great skill in sifting out the truth and indeed he appears in this instance to have been no fool he was by all the while at the accusation and heard no names mentioned why then should he ask her what man she was accused of but in this lay the subtilty of his examination for had hero been guilty it was very probable that in the hurry and confusion of spirits into which the terrible insult of her lover had thrown her she would never have observed that the mans name was not mentioned and so on this question might have betrayed herself by naming the person she was conscious of an affair with the friar observed this and so concluded that were she guilty she would probably have fallen into the trap he had laid for her i only take notice of this to show how admirably well shakespeare knew how to sustain his characters  but this noble defense for the unhappy hero not being sufficient to obviate the strong impressions of her guilt which the father had conceived against her the honest priest then goes on to propose a scheme of conduct to him which might peradventure bring about some crisis or event that would clear her innocence at least silence the infamy and remove her from being any longer an object of obloquy in this proposal there is shown a just knowledge of the world and an intimate acquaintance with the secret movements of the human heart  friar pause a while and let my counsel sway you in this case your daughter here the princes left for dead on her fainting  let her a time be secretly kept in and publish it that she is so indeed maintain a mourning ostentation and on your familys old monument hang mournful epitaphs and do all rite that appertain unto a burial  leonato what shall become of this what will this do  friar marry this well carried shall on her behalf change slander to remorse that is some good but not for that i dream on this strange course but on this travail look for greater birth she dying as it must be so maintained upon the instant that she was accused shall be lamented pitied and excused of every hearer for it so falls out that what we have we prize not to the worth whiles we enjoy it but being lacked and lost why then we reck the value then we find the virtue that possession would not show us whilst it was ours so shall it fare with claudio when he shall hear she died upon his words the idea of her life shall sweetly creep into his study of imagination and every lovely organ of her life shall come apparelled in more precious habit more moving delicate and full of life into the eye and prospect of his soul than when she lived indeed then shall he mourn if ever love had interest in his liver and wish he had not so accused her no though he thought his accusation true let this be so and doubt not but success will fashion the event in better shape than i can lay it down in likelihood but if all aim but this be levelled false the supposition of the ladys death will quench the wonder of her infamy and if it sort not well you may conceal her as best befits her wounded reputation in some reclusive and religious life out of all eyes tongues minds and injuries  to this innocent deception the father at length consents expressing himself at the same time in a manner that every persons experience who has ever had the misfortune to have been in such situations must have felt the justness of  leonato being that i flow in grief the smallest twine may lead me  doctor johnsons note upon this passage is worthy of being quoted here  this is one of our authors observations upon life men overpowered with distress eagerly listen to the first offers of relief close with every scheme and believe every promise he that has no longer any confidence in himself is glad to repose his trust in any other that will undertake to guide him  scene iii beatrice in spiriting up benedick to avenge her cousin heros quarrel thus expresses her resentment against the offender is he not approved in the height a villain that has slandered scorned dishonored my kinswoman o that i were a man what bear her in hand until they come to take hands and then with public accusation uncovered slander unmitigated rancour  o god that i were a man i would eat his heart in the marketplace o that i were a man for his sake or that i had any friend would be a man for my sake but manhood is melted into courtesies valor into compliment and men are only turned into tongue and trim ones too  he is now as valiant as hercules that only tells a lie and swears to it  i cannot be a man with wishing therefore i will die a woman with grieving  there is a generous warmth of indignation in this speech which must certainly impress a female reader with the same sentiments upon such an occasion i am not so disingenuous to take advantage of this passage as an historical fact but am willing to rest it upon the sole authority of the poets assumption as this will sufficiently answer the design of my introducing it which is to vindicate my sex from the general but unjust charge of being prone to slander for were this the case were not the resentment of beatrice in this instance natural how could it move our sympathy which it actually does here even though we acknowledge the circumstance to have been merely imaginary  i believe that there is nothing which a woman of virtue feels herself more offended at than defamation or scandal first against her own character and proportionably when others are made the victims there are women indeed who may be fond of flander as having an interest in depreciating an idea of chastity but this is owing to their frailty not their sex  vice is neither masculine nor feminine it is the common of two  act v scene i while the abovementioned experiment was depending and before the honor of hero had been cleared antonio her uncle endeavors to comfort his brother under this misfortune who replies to him in a manner very natural for a person laboring under the immediate pressure of affliction to speak to all advisers who do not suffer the same portion of grief themselves  leonato i pray thee cease thy counsel which falls into mine ears as profitless as water in a sieve  give me not counsel nor let no comforter delight mine ear but such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine bring me a father that so loved his child whose joy of her is overwhelmed like mine and bid him speak of patience  measure his woe the length and breadth of mine and let it answer every strain for strain and thus for thus and such a grief for such in every lineament branch shape and form if such a one will smile and stroke his beard cry sorrow wag and hem when he should groan patch grief with proverbs make misfortune drunk with candlewasters bring him yet to me and i of him will gather patience but there is no such man for brother men can counsel and give comfort to that grief which they themselves not feel but tasting it their counsel turns to passion which before would give preceptial medicine to rage fetter strong madness in a silken thread charm ach with air and agony with words no no  it is all mens office to speak patience to those that wring under the load of sorrow but no mans virtue or sufficiency to be so moral when he shall endure the like himself  therefore give me no counsel my griefs cry louder than advertisement advertisement for admnition   antonio therein do men from children nothing differ  leonato i prithee peace i will be flesh and blood for there was never yet philosopher that could endure the toothache patiently however they have writ the style of gods and made a pish at chance and sufferance  scene ii upon the two brothers meeting claudio soon after the father challenges him to single combat for the scandal he had thrown upon his daughters fame which being passed off in a sort of contemptuous manner the resentment of the younger brother is roused and he immediately steps between and takes the quarrel upon himself retorting the affront by a just description of the bragging profligates of those or indeed of any times horatios taunt to lothario in the fair penitent seems to have been borrowed from this passage  claudio to leonato away i will not have to do with you leonato can thou so daffe an old english expression for putting of or setting aside me thou have killed my child if thou killst me boy thou shall kill a man  antonio he shall kill two of us and men indeed but that is no matter let him kill one first win me and wear me let him answer me come follow me boy  come boy follow me sir boy i will whip you from your foining fence nay as i am a gentleman i will  leonato brother   antonio content yourself  god knows i loved my niece and she is dead slandered to death by villains that dare as well answer a man indeed as i dare take a serpent by the tongue boys apes braggarts jacks milksops  leonato brother anthony   antonio hold you content  what man i know them yea and what they weigh even to the utmost scruple scambling outfacing fashionmonging boys that lie and cog and flout deprave and slander go antickly and show an outward hideousness and speak off half a dozen dangerous words how they might hurt their enemies  if they durst and this is all  as i commenced my remarks on this play with a note of doctor warburtons i shall conclude them also with another very judicious observation of the same critic upon this last passage  this brother anthony is the truest picture imaginable of human nature he had assumed the character of a sage to comfort his brother oerwhelmed with grief for his only daughters affront and dishonor and had severely reproved him for not commanding his passion better on so trying an occasion yet immediately after this no sooner does he begin to suspect that his age and valor are slighted but he falls into the most intemperate fit of rage himself and all his brother can say or do is not of power to pacify him this is copying nature with a penetration and exactness of judgment peculiar to shakespeare as to the expression too of his passion nothing can be more highly painted  all is well that ends well dramatis personae men king of france bertram count of rousillon lafeu an old lord parolles a parasite and coward attendant on bertram a lord a steward women countess of rousillon mother to bertram helena her ward daughter to a famous physician long since dead all is well that ends well act i scene i the countess of rousillon speaking of helena her ward says i have those hopes of her good that her education promises her disposition she inherits which makes fair gifts fairer for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities there commendations go with pity they are virtues and traitors too in her they are the better for her simpleness she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness  the commentators are not agreed in opinion upon the verbal sense of this passage  but no matter i shall leave their criticism undecided and proceed to the moral interpretation of it which is that a derived virtue which implies a natural good disposition affords considerable assistance to a good education that accomplishments without such a foundation are a disadvantage to the possessors as but tending to their condemnation and reproach that the innocence and simplicity of helenas mind and heart made use of no arts but left her talents to the natural effect of their own operations and that though a good disposition may be inherited virtues must be purchased  in the same scene when bertram comes to take leave of his mother in order to attend the king she gives him her blessing in a most pathetic manner and the most effectual too where the seeds of virtue are by setting his noble father before him as a pattern to this she likewise adds some precepts for the conduct of his life which would have done honor to the first sages of egypt greece or rome  countess be thou blessed bertram and succeed thy father in manners as in shape thy blood and virtue contend for empire in thee and thy goodness share with thy birthright love all trust a few do wrong to none be able for thine enemy rather in power than use and keep thy friend under thy own lifes key be checked for silence but never taxed for speech what heaven more will that thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down fall on thy head farewell my son  scene ii frequent descriptions of love recur in almost every one of shakespeares plays the enamoured helena speaks very affectingly on this subject here first by reproving the vain ambition of her passion for bertram a young nobleman so far above her hopes and then proceeding notwithstanding though very naturally to give an account of the fond indulgencies with which she still nourishes her flame  helena my imagination carries no favor in it but my bertrams i am undone there is no living none if bertram be away  it were all one that i should love a bright particular star and think to wed it he is so above me in his bright radiance and collateral light must i be comforted not in his sphere the ambition in my love thus plagues itself the hind that would be mated by the lion must die for love  t was pretty though a plague to see him every hour to sit and draw his arched brows his hawking eye his curls in our hearts tablet heart too capable of every line and trick of his sweet favor but now he is gone and my idolatrous fancy must sanctify his relics  the preferences which worthless people flatterers and parasites too often gain by address and compliances before persons of unsupple merit and virtue are well set forth in this place  helena speaking of parolles says i know him a notorious liar think him a great way fool wholly a coward yet these fixed evils sit so sit in him that they take place when virtues steely bones look bleak in the cold wind full often we see cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly cold for naked and superfluous for wellcloathed warburton    scene iv there are some excellent wellspirited reflections here thrown out to encourage men in the exertion of all their active faculties toward the advancement of their fortunes and to earn their independance by the manly means of industry instead of poorly crouching at the gates of providence whining for an alms  helena upon her resolving to undertake the cure of the kings disorder in hopes through that means to raise her rank and fortune to a respect not unworthy of bertram says our remedies often in ourselves do lie which we ascribe to heaven the fated sky gives us free scope only does backward pull our flow designs when we ourselves are dull what power is it which mounts my love so high that makes me see and cannot feed mine eye feed mine eye that is with hope  through mightiest space in fortune nature brings likes to join likes and kiss like native things impossible be strange attempts to those that weigh their pain in sense who judge from the common appearances of things  and do suppose what have not been cannot be  who ever strove to show her merit that did miss her love the kings disease my project may deceive me but my intents are fixed and will not leave me   scene v there is a most beautiful character given here of a gallant soldier and virtuous courtier in the description of bertrams deceased father with some just strictures on the deficiency of these qualities in the succeeding generation which being the principal parts of the speech i have first noted in it but as there is also a charming mixture of the old man and the old friend in the rest of it i shall here give the whole together  king to bertram i would i had that corporal soundness now as when thy father and myself in friendship first tried our soldiership he did look far into the service of the time and was discipled of the bravest he lasted long but on us both did haggish age steal on and wore us out of act  it much repairs me to talk of your good father in his youth he had the wit which i can well observe today in our young lords but they may jest till their own scorn return to them unnoted ere they can bide their levity in honor doctor johnson has given the following note upon this line this is an excellent observation jocose follies and slight offenses are only allowed by mankind in him that overpowers them by great qualities  so like a courtier contempt nor bitterness were in his pride or sharpness if they were his equal had awaked them and his honor clock to itself knew the true minute when exceptions bid him speak and at that time his tongue obeyed the hand who were below him he used as creatures of another place and bowed his eminent top to their low ranks making them proud of his humility in their poor praise he humbled such a man might be a copy to these younger times which followed well would now demonstrate them but goers backward would were with him he would always say  methinks i hear him now  his plausive words he scattered not in ears but grafted them to grow there and to bear  let me not live  thus his good melancholy often began on the catastrophe and heel of pastime when it was out  let me not live quoth he after my flame lacks oil to be the snuff of younger spirits whose apprehensive senses all but new things disdain whose judgments are mere fathers of their garments whose constancies expire before their fashions  this he wished i after him do after him wish too since i nor wax nor honey can bring home i quickly were dissolved from my hive to give some laborers room the selfinterruptions in the above speech how admirably are they in the usual style of a narrative old man what age what sex what character station or office of life escapes the touches of shakespeares plastic hand  scene vi the diffidence which every one should manifest respecting their own merits is well recommended in the following passage  the steward speaking to the countess madam the care i have had to even to even to keep pace with your content i wish might be rather found in the calendar of my past endeavors for then we wound our modesty and make foul the cleanness of our deservings when of ourselves we publish them  act ii scene vi there are a number of moral and philosophic thoughts on worth and virtue and on the severe laws which the pride and vanity of mankind have established against their own happiness and enjoyments quam temere in nosmet legem sancimus iniquam hor  delivered here on the occasion of bertrams declining a marriage with helena who had confessed her love for him to the king because the happened to have neither birth or means to entitle her to the honor of his alliance  king strange is it that our bloods whose color weight and heat poured out together would quite confound distinction yet stand off in differences so mighty if she be all that is virtuous save what thou dislikest a poor physicians daughter thou dislikest of virtue for a name but do not so  from lowest place when virtuous things proceed the place is dignified by the doers deed where great addition swells and virtue none it is a dropsied honor  virtue alone is good without a name helen is so the property by what it is should go not by the title  she is young wise fair in these to nature she is immediate heir and these breed honor that is honors scorn which challenges itself as honors born and is not like the sire honors best thrive when rather from our acts we them derive than our foregoers the mere words a slave debaucht on every tomb on every grave a lying trophy and as often is dumb where dust and damned reprful to the living who neglect monumental inscriptions to the meritorious dead i am surprised that the commentators have left this obscure expression without a light oblivion is the tomb of honored bones indeed  scene vii when lafeu has quitted the scene after having bullied and abused parolles the latter being left alone makes this soliloquy parolles well thou have a son that shall take this disgrace of me scurvy old filthy lord well  i must be patient there is no fettering of authority i will beat him by my life if i can meet him with any convenience an he were double and double a lord i will have no more pity of his age than i would have of  i will beat him an if i could but meet him again     upon this passage doctor warburton takes occasion to pay the following just compliment to our author  this the poet makes parolles to speak alone and this is nature a coward would endeavor to hide his poltroonery even from himself an ordinary writer would have been glad of such an opportunity to bring him to a confession  act iii scene iv when bertram whom the king had compelled to espouse helena flies from france to avoid any farther connection with her and had engaged in the tuscan war her mourning and reflections upon that occasion are extremely moving and tender particularly in her manner of accusing herself with having been the cause of all his perils  helena poor lord is it i that chase thee from thy country and expose those tender limbs of thine to the event of the nonesparing war and is it i that drive thee from the sportive court where thou wast shot at with fair eyes to be the mark of smoky muskets o ye leaden messengers that ride upon the violent speed of fire fly with false aim pierce the stillmoving air that sings with piercing  do not touch my lord whoever shoots at him i set him there whoever charges on his forward breast i am the caitiff that do hold him to it and though i kill him not i am the cause his death was so effected better it were i met the ravening lion when he roared with sharp constraint of hunger better it were that all the miseries which nature owes were mine at once no come thou home rousillon whence honor but of danger wins a scar as often it loses all i will be gone  my being here it is that holds thee hence shall i stay here to do it no no although the air of paradise did fan the house and angels officed all  i will be gone that pitiful rumor may report my flight to consolate thine ear  act iv scene iii i shall conclude these observations with a reflection made in this place on the mixed character of human nature in general in which virtue and vice are often so balanced or blended as to prevent perfection on one hand and total depravation on the other  a lord the web of our life is of a mingled yarn good and ill together our virtues would be proud if our faults whipped them not and our crimes would despair if they were not cherished by our virtues   postscript i have here finished my notes upon all the comedies of shakespeare and hope that the indulgent reader will be so kind as to dismiss me in this part of my work with a favorable application of the last title or all is well that ends well  perhaps i may not be allowed the distinction of comedies as referred to the fourteen foregoing plays as the shipwreck in the tempest antigonus being devoured by a bear and the prince dying of grief in the winters tale etc are not very comic circumstances but this is the division that is generally made of our authors drama though strictly speaking his plays cannot properly be styled either tragedies or comedies but are in truth a more natural species of composition than either  king john dramatis personae men king john philip king of france arthur nephew to king john lewis the dauphin cardinal pandulpho the popes legate salisbury an english lord faulconbridge bastard son to richard the first hubert lieutenant of the tower women constance mother to arthur king john act ii scene vi the following speech though delivered with an air of levity and expressed in humorous words and images supplies occasion for three very just reflections the first that self interest in the mere worldly sense of the term is the ruling principle of mankind secondly that men are too apt to inveigh against corruption more from the being void of temptation themselves than their being free from this vice and lastly that bad examples in the superior ranks of life have a dangerous tendency to injure the morals of the inferior classes of a people  upon a peace being made between the kings of england and france in which the right of arthur to the british throne is betrayed on the one hand and but poorly compensated on the other faulconbridge makes this soliloquy first part mad world mad kings mad composition john to stop arthurs title in the whole has willingly departed with a part and france whose armor conscience buckled on whom zeal and charity brought to the field as gods own soldier to support arthurs claim  rounded in the ear with that same purposechanger that fly devil that broker that still breaks the pate of faith that daily breakvow he that wins of all of kings of beggars old men young men maids who having no external thing to lose but the word maid cheats the poor girl of that that smoothfaced gentleman tickling commodity  commodity the bias of the world the world which of itself is poized well made to run even upon even ground till this advantage this vile drawing bias this sway of motion this commodity makes it take head from all indifferency from all direction purpose course intent and this same bias this commodity this bawd this broker this allchanging word clapped on the outward eye of fickle france has drawn him from his own determined aid from a resolved and honorable war to a most base and vileconcluded peace second part yet why rail i on this commodity but for because he has not wooed me yet not that i have the power to clutch my hand when his fair angels would salute my palm but that my hand as unattempted yet like a poor beggar raileth on the rich well while i am a beggar i will rail and say there is no sin but to be rich and being rich my virtue then shall be to say there is no vice but beggary third part since kings break faith upon commodity gain be my lord for i will worship thee   the astonishment of constance on hearing that her sons interests are sacrificed to the league with the doubts which we are naturally inclined to conceive of the truth of sudden ill news and the weak state of mind and spirits to which persons in misfortune especially helpless women are generally reduced are all finely painted and described in the following speech  constance arthur and salisbury constance to salisbury gone to be married one of the articles of the compact was an alliance between a niece of johns and the dauphin the inheritances which of right belonged to arthur being the dowry  gone to swear a peace false blood to false blood joined gone to be friends shall lewis have blanch and blanch those provinces it is not so thou have misspoke misheard be well advised tell over thy tale again  it cannot be  thou do but say it is so i trust i may not trust thee  for thy word is but the vain breath of a common man believe me i do not believe thee man  i have a kings oath to the contrary thou shall be punished for thus frighting me for i am sick and capable of fears oppressed with wrongs and therefore full of fears  a widow husbandless subject to fears a woman naturally born to fears and though thou now confess thou did but jest with my vexed spirits i cannot make a truce but they will quake and tremble all this day  what do thou mean by shaking of thy head why do thou look so sadly on my son what means that hand upon that breast of thine why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum like a proud river peering over his bounds be these sad sighs confirmers of thy words then speak again not all thy former tale but this one word whether thy tale be true a little further upon salisburys confirming the bad news she conceives a very natural though unreasonable idea with which however we are apt to be impressed toward all messengers of bad tidings however innocent of the evil fellow be gone i cannot brook thy sight  this news has made thee a most ugly man   that partiality in favor of beauty which it is natural for all persons to be sensible of even where their duty and interests in different objects are equal is strongly marked by constance when her son begs her to sustain his wrongs with patience the whole speech is affecting  constance if thou that bidst me be content were grim ugly and slanderous to thy mothers womb full of unpleasing blots and sightles for unsightly shakespeare often places the negative at the end of the adjective instead of the beginning this varies his phrases and enriches his language modern writers are too much dictionarybound stains lame foolish crooked swart prodigious for portentous monstrous births being reckoned ominous formerly  patched with foul moles and eyeoffending marks i would not care i then could be content for then i should not love thee no nor thou become thy great birth nor deserve a crown but thou art fair and at thy birth dear boy nature and fortune joined to make thee great of natures gifts thou may with lilies boast and with the halfblown rose  in the same scene when salisbury tells her that the two kings had sent for her and that be must not return without her the answer she makes is full of that dignity which grief mixed with resentment is capable of conferring on illustrious unfortunates and her whole demeanor upon that occasion is expressive of a great soul rendered still braver by misfortunes  constance thou may thou shall i will not go with thee i will instruct my sorrows to be proud for grief is proud and makes his owner stout to me and to the state of my great grief let kings assemble for my griefs so great that no supporter but the huge firm earth can hold it up  here i and sorrow fit  here is my throne bid kings come bow to it  sits down on the floor doctor johnson has given us a very judicious note on this passage and as it relates to the passions which as well as morals are a subject of this work i shall present the reader with a transcript of it here  in much ado about nothing the father of hero depressed by her disgrace declares himself so subdued by grief that a thread may lead him being that i low in grief the  may lead me act iv scene ii   how is it that grief in leonato and lady constance produces effects directly opposite and yet both agreeable to nature sorrow softens the mind while it is yet warmed by hope but hardens it when it is congealed by despair distress while there remains any prospect of relief is weak and flexible but when no succor appears is fearless and stubborn angry alike at those who injure and at those who do not help careless to please where nothing can be gained and fearless to offend when there is nothing further to be dreaded such was this authors knowledge of the passions  scene ii what expressions can be stronger in themselves or more shocking to the ears of her oppressors than the following short exclamation  constance arm arm ye heavens against these perjured kings a widow cries be husband to me heaven  here the speech should have ended the four remaining lines but weaken and disgrace it  scene iii when philip is urged by the popes legate to break the league he had just entered into with john he offers to compound the treachery by ceasing to be his friend but without becoming his enemy  i may disjoin my hand but not my faith to which pandulpho makes him this reply so make thou faith an enemy to faith and like a civil war setst oath to oath thy tongue against thy tongue o let thy vow first made to heaven first be to heaven performed that is to be the champion of the church what since thou sworest is sworn against thyself and may not be performed by thyself for that which thou have sworn to do amiss is it not amiss when it is truly done and being not done where doing tends to ill the truth is then most done not doing it the better act of purposes mistook is to mistake again though indirect yet indirection thereby grows direct and falsehood falsehood cures as fire cools fire within the scorched veins of one new burned it is religion that does make vows kept but thou have sworn against religion by which thou swearst against the thing thou swearst and make an oath the surety for thy truth against an oath the truth thou art unsure to swear swear only not to be forsworn else what a mockery should it be to swear but thou do swear only to be forsworn and most forsworn to keep what thou do swear therefore thy latter vows against thy first is in thyself rebellion to thyself and better conquest never can thou make than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts against these giddy loose suggestions upon which better part our prayers come in if thou vouchsafe them but if not then know the peril of our curses light on thee so heavy as thou shall not shake them off but in despair die under their black weight   the old jesuit argues here as ingeniously for the dispensing power of the papacy as satan does in milton for his rebellion the object of both is the same namely the absolute and exclusive dominion of heaven  scene vi the wild and enthusiastic manner with which the fondness and despair of constance for her son impels her to speak of him has something extremely moving in it father cardinal i have heard you say that we shall see and know our friends in heaven if that be i shall see my boy again for since the birth of cain the first male child to him that did but yesterday suspire there was not such a gracious creature born but now will canker sorrow eat my bud and chase the native beauty from his cheek and he will look as hollow as a ghost as dim and meagre as an aguefit and so he will die and rising so again when i shall meet him in the court of heaven i shall not know him therefore never never must i behold my pretty arthur more   there is something very tender and affecting in her making use of the epithet pretty in the last line it has a better effect there than dearest angel or even lovely though this last has a more comprehensive sense would have had in that place i must beg leave to refer to the readers own taste for the justness of this observation for i own i cannot explain why it strikes me in this manner myself  the reason why we are apt to cherish grief in our breasts that species of it i only mean which may be distinguished by the name of tender sorrow from a peculiar sort of indulgence it is capable of affording us is admirably well expressed in the following passage pandulpho you hold too heinous a respect of grief  constance he talks to me who never had a son  philip you seem as fond of grief as of your child  constance grief fills the room up of my absent child lies in his bed walks up and down with me puts on his pretty looks repeats his words remembers me of all his gracious parts stuffs out his vacant garments with his form then have i reason to be fond of grief fare you well had you such a loss as i i could give better comfort than you do i will not keep this form upon my head tearing off her headdress when there is such disorder in my wits o lord my boy my arthur my fair son my life my joy my food my all the world my widows comfort and my sorrows cure    these last three lines are almost suffocating i believe no woman with a mothers feeling could ever be able to pronounce them articulately even in representation  doctor johnson gives a good note on one of the passages of the above speech had you such a loss as i i could give better comfort than you do l   and     this is a sentiment which great sorrow always dictates whoever cannot help himself casts his eyes on others for assistance and often mistakes their inability for coldness  i remember a couple of french lines on this subject of grief which contain the same thought that constance expresses above men devil me plait et doit toujours me plaire il me tient lieu de celu que je pleurs   scene viii lewis life is as tedious as a twicetold tale vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man  this may be a just image of life to those who have exhausted its variety and palled their senses with its pleasures the speech might not have ill become his father old philip then laboring under baffled hopes and disappointed wishes who had just then suffered the mortification of having lost a battle in the heart of his own dominions and whose mistaken faith in heaven had obliged him to break faith on earth without effect too but it was certainly rather too premature a sentence to have proceeded from the lips of a young prince who had been but just married to a woman he loved such an impropriety in the character of a speaker hurts the effect of a thought or sentiment  in the same scene there is a strong description given of the situation of a sovereign with regard to the people after he has forfeited their love confidence or esteem  pandulpho speaking of johns keeping arthur in prison this act so evilly born shall cool the hearts of all his people and freeze up their zeal that no so small advantage shall step forth to check his reign but they will cherish it no natural exhalation in the sky no escape of nature see the note before in this play on the word prodigious in the first scene of this act  no distempered day no common wind no customed event but they will pluck away its natural cause and call them meteors prodigies and signs abortives and presages tongues of heaven plainly denouncing vengeance upon john and then the hearts of all his people shall revolt from him and kiss the lips of unacquainted change and pick strong matter of revolt and wrath out of the bloody fingers ends of john   act iv scene iv the several useful reflections and morals to be collected from the following speeches are so many and so mixed that it is difficult to separate or distinguish them i shall therefore lay the whole passage together before the reader to draw his own inferences from and shall also begin the scene a little earlier than may at first appear to be necessary not only on account of the admirable painting presented to us in the beginning of it but in order to show the situation of circumstances in which the principal speaker stands at the time  king john and hubert hubert my lord they say five moons were seen tonight four fixed and the fifth did whirl about the other four in wondrous motion  john five moons  hubert old men and beldams in the streets do prophecy upon it dangerously young arthurs death is common in their mouths and when they talk of him they shake their heads and whisper one another in the ear and he that speaks does gripe the hearers wrist whilst he that hears makes fearful action with wrinkled brows with nods with rolling eyes i saw a smith stand with his hammer thus the whilst his iron did on the anvil cool with open mouth swallowing a taylors news who with his shears and measure in his hand standing on slippers which his nimble haste had falsely thrust upon contrary feet told of a many thousand warlike french that were embattled and ranked in kent another lean unwashed artificer cuts off his tale and talks of arthurs death  john why seekst thou to possess me with these fears why urgest thou so often young arthurs death thy hand has murdered him i had a cause to wish him dead but thou had none to kill him  hubert had none my lord why did you not provoke me provoke me for prompt or solicit me   john it is the curse of kings to be attended by slaves that take their humors for a warrant to break into the bloody house of life and on the winking of authority to understand a law to know the meaning of dangerous difficult to be dealt with majesty when perchance it frowns more upon humor than advised respect  hubert here is your hand and seal for what i did  john oh when the last account twixt heaven and earth is to be made then shall this hand and seal witness against us to damnation how often the sight of means to do ill deeds makes deeds ill done for had not thou been by a fellow by the hand of nature marked quoted and signed to do a deed of shame this murder had not come into my mind but taking note of thy abhorred aspect finding thee fit for bloody villainy apt liable to be employed in danger i faintly broke with thee of arthurs death and thou to be endeared to a king made it no conscience to destroy a prince  hubert my lord   john had thou but shook thy head or made a pause when i spoke darkly what i purposed or turned an eye of doubt upon my face or bid me tell my tale in express words deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off and those thy fears might have wrought fears in me but thou did understand me by my signs and did in signs again parley with sin yea without stop did let thy heart consent and consequently thy rude hand to act the deed which both our tongues held vile to name  out of my sight and never see me more my nobles leave me and my state is braved even at my gates with ranks of foreign powers nay in the body of this fleshy land this kingdom this confine of blood and breath hostility and civil tumult reign between my conscience and my cousins death  doctor johnson has made a comment on the latter part of this scene which the reader has a right to claim in this place  there are many touches of nature in this conference of john with hubert a man engaged in wickedness would keep the profit to himself and transfer the guilt to his accomplice these reproaches vented against hubert are not the words of art or policy but the eruptions of a mind swelling with the consciousness of a crime and desirous of discharging its misery on another  this account of the timidity of guilt had thou but shook thy head etc is drawn ab ipsis recessibus mentis from an intimate knowledge of mankind particularly that line in which he says that to have bid him tell his tale in express words would have struck him dumb nothing is more certain than that bad men use all the arts of fallacy upon themselves palliate their actions to their own minds by gentle terms and hide themselves from their own detection in ambiguities and subterfuges  scene vii when hubert has been suspected and charged with the murder of prince arthur the speech of faulconbridge to him is finely expressive of the strength of despair arising from a guilty conscience if thou did but consent to this most cruel act do but despair and if thou want a cord the smallest thread that ever spider twisted from her womb will strangle thee a rush will be a beam to hang thee on or would thou drown thyself put but a little water in a spoon and it shall be as all the ocean enough to stifle such a villain up   act v scene i the manner and spirit with which great personages should act on extraordinary occasions of difficulty or danger are bravely pointed out by the gallant faulconbridge in the following speech to king john when the french had invaded his kingdom  faulconbridge but wherefore do you droop why look you sad be great in act as you have been in thought  let not the world see fear and sad distrust govern the motion of a kingly eye be stirring as the time be fire with fire threaten the threatener and outface the brow of bragging horror so shall inferior eyes that borrow their behaviors from the great grow great by your example and put on the dauntless spirit of resolution away and glitter like the god of war when he intends to become the field show boldness and aspiring confidence  what shall they seek the lion in his den and fright him there and make him tremble there o let it not be said forage forage to range abroad this is its original sense and so used here  and run to meet displeasure farther from the doors and grapple with him ere he comes so nigh  scene ii the struggles and compunctions of a good mind upon the being necessitated to take that part in a public cause which in polity is styled rebellion and also the horrid nature of a civil war are finely and justly drawn here  salisbury and the dauphin salisbury and noble dauphin albeit we swear a voluntary zeal and unurged faith to your proceedings yet believe me prince i am not glad that such a sore of time should seek a plaster by contemned revolt and heal the inveterate canker of one wound by making many  oh it grieves my soul that i must draw this metal from my side to be a widowmaker  oh and there where honorable rescue and defense cries out upon the name of salisbury but such is the infection of the time that for the health and physic of our right we cannot deal but with the very hand of stern injustice and confused wrong and is it not pity oh my grieved friends that we the sons and children of this isle were born to see so sad an hour as this wherein we step after a stranger march upon her gentle bosom and fill up her enemies ranks i must withdraw and weep upon the spot of this enforced cause to grace the gentry of a land remote and follow unacquainted colors here what here  o nation that thou could remove that neptune arms who clippeth thee about would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself and grapple thee unto a pagan shore where these two christian armies might combine the blood of malice in a vein of league and not to spend it so unneighbourly  the answer to this speech is fine it pays due honor to the generous conflict in the speakers breast and makes a distinction between the effects of male and female tears paying the usual but too partial compliment to the former be it so  the first are stronger on account of their being more rare owing solely to the superior harshness of mens natures but as the passions and feelings which the spectator is sensible of from each are so very different in their nature too i cannot see how any sort of comparison can be fairly made between them  dauphin a noble temper do thou show in this and great affection wrestling in thy bosom does make an earthquake of nobility oh what a noble combat have thou fought between compulsion and a brave respect let me wipe off this honorable dew that silverly does progress on thy cheeks my heart has melted at a ladys tears being an ordinary inundation but this effusion of such manly drops this shower blown up by tempest of the soul statles mine eyes and makes me more amazed than had i seen the vaulty top of heaven figured quite over with burning meteors  lift up thy brow renowned salisbury and with a great heart heave away this storm commend these waters to those babyeyes that never saw the giant world enraged nor met with fortune other than at feasts fullwarm of blood of mirth of gossipping  scene x salisbury speaking to king john perceives him dead  my liege my lord  but now a king  now thus this would make a good epitaph for a royal sepulcher  this play closes with one truth in fact and another in prophecy which i hope all time will vouch the inspiration of  faulconbridge this england never did nor ever shall lie at the proud foot of a conqueror but when it first did help to wound itself now these her princes the revolted nobles are come home again come the three corners of the world in arms and we shall shock them  naught shall make us rue if england to itself do rest but true  richard the second dramatis personae men richard the second duke of york uncles to the king john of gaunt duke of lancaster uncles to the king mowbray duke of norfolk bolinbroke son to john of gaunt aumerle son to the duke of york earl of northumberland bishop of carlisle sir stephen scroop exton governor of pomfret castle bushy servants to the king scroop servants to the king women queen to king richard richard the second act i scene i this play opens with a proper caution to all judges and jurors in criminal causes to attend most carefully to the principle or motive by which the accuser appears to be actuated that the credit of his testimony may be rated accordingly  when the king calls the suit of bolinbroke against norfolk upon trial he speaks thus to the father of the former king old john of gaunt timehonoured lancaster have thou according to thy oath and bond brought hither henry hereford thy bold son here to make good the boisterous late appeal which then our leisure would not let us hear against the duke of norfolk thomas mowbray  lancaster i have my liege  king tell me moreover have thou sounded him if he appeal the duke on ancient malice or worthily as a good subject should on some known ground of treachery in him  lancaster as near as i could sift him on that argument on some apparent danger seen in him aimed at your highness no inveterate malice  king then call them to our presence face to face and frowning brow to brow ourselves will hear the accuser and the accused freely speak    scene ii when the king forbids the combat and commands the duke of norfolk to throw down bolinbrokes gage a gage or gantlet was a sort of iron glove or piece of armor for the hand thrown down in defiance in the old chivalry and taken up by the antagonist upon an acceptance of the challenge  he answers with the true spirit of a gallant nobleman norfolk myself i throw dread sovereign at thy foot my life thou shall command but not my shame the one my duty owes but my fair name despite of death that lives upon my grave to dark dishonours use thou shall not have i am disgraced impeached and baffled here pierced to the soul with slanders venomed spear the which no balm can cure but his heartblood which breathed the poison it was an old notion in physic that the blood of a viper applied to the wound would cure its    king rage must be withstood give him his gage  lions make leopards tame  norfolk yea but not change their spots take but my shame and i resign my gage my dear dear lord the purest treasure mortal times afford i spo reputation that away men are but gilded loam or painted clay a jewel in a tentimesbarrdup chest is a bold spirit in a loyal breast mine honor is my life both grow in one take honor from me and my life is done then dear my liege mine honor let me try in that i live and for that i will die    afterward when bolinbroke is called upon to the same purpose he also replies as bravely but as he expresses himself in so much an inferior manner to the former i think it could afford the reader no great entertainment to have the passage quoted  scene iv when the king sentences these two champions to exile he exacts an oath from them both not to be reconciled to one another abroad so far as to confederate against the state of england in the administering of which bond he desires them to swear by the duty that you owe to heaven our part therein we banish with yourselves   upon which latter line doctor warburton gives the following note  it is a question much debated among the writers on the law of nations whether a banished man be still tied in allegiance to the state which sent him into exile tully and clarendon declare for the affirmative hobbes and puffendorf hold the negative our author by this line seems to be of the latter opinion  but i agree entirely with cicero and clarendon the undergoing any penalty of law cannot dissolve either the moral or the political duty we owe our country socrates by refusing to escape out of prison showed that he thought his obedience and submission to the state continued still to be obligatory on him even though the decree was unjust and the sentence death and under the ostracism which imposed banishment upon men for their very eminence and virtue we do not hear of the illustrious exiles either speaking or acting as if they deemed their allegiance to have been cancelled  nay aristides carried the submission of a good subject so far as to think himself obliged in duty to write his own name on a shell at the request of an illiterate citizen of athens who voted against him on that very law and themistocles though banished through the spirit of faction not that of the laws and kindly entertained and preferred in the armies of persia chose to swallow poison rather than march against his country  it is not the community that banishes a man but the laws which govern it  it is the law not i condemns your brother angelo to isabella measure for measure  these surely are no object of resentment and to rise in arms against a nation because one of its statutes had fallen heavy upon us would be just as rational as to set a forest on fire because we had received the bastinado by a cudgel that was taken out of it  scene v king and lancaster king why uncle thou have many years to live  lancaster but not a minute king that thou can give shorten my days thou can with sullen sorrow and pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow thou can help time to furrow me with age but step no wrinkle in his pilgrimage thy word is current with him for my death but dead thy kingdom cannot buy my breath  upon which passage there is the following reflection in the note by doctor johnson  it is matter of very melancholy consideration that all human advantages confer more power of doing evil than good a very melancholy reflection indeed were we to suppose it true  in the instance before us the hand of power strength or treachery may certainly deprive us of a life which it cannot restore but shakespeare does not mean to make the reflection universal a good prince may render his whole people happy a bad one can only affect a part when tyranny becomes general it defeats itself at the cost of the oppressor  if my objection to the above uncomfortable maxim be valid in the highest example it would be trifling to adduce any lesser ones to prove it  scene vi lancaster by way of comforting his son upon the sentence of banishment paraphrases and poeticises the old english sentence of every place is an honest mens home in these words all places that the eye of heaven visits are to a wise man pots and happy havens which lines are followed by a long and equivocal declamation in the style of the stoic philosophy to which bolinbroke impatiently replies in a manner perfectly natural to the unhappy for it requires leisure to grow wise nor is this ever effected by our becoming better able to bear misfortune but by our feeling it less from use and habit  bl oh who can hold a fire in his hand by thinking on the frostly caucasus or wallow naked in decembers snow by thinking on fantastic summers heat or cloy the hungry edge of appetite by bare imagination of a feast i have transposed these four lines to preserve the order of the images  oh no the apprehension of the good gives but the greater feeling to the worse fell sorrows tooth does never rankle more than when it bites but lanceth not the sore  act ii scene i the weight of persuasion which the admonitions of a dying person are apt to impress upon the mind more than the most lively remonstrances of one in perfect health is well expressed here the circumstances of the time impress us with an awe which imprints the advice more strongly on our memory and gives it additional authority  lancaster brought in sick attended by the duke of york  lancaster will the king come that i may breathe my last in wholesome counsel to his unstayed youth  york vex not yourself nor strive not with your breath for all in vain comes counsel to his ear  lancaster oh but they say the tongues of dying men enforce attention like deep harmony where words are scarce they are seldom spent in vain for they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain he that no more must say is listened more than they whom youth and ease have taught to gloss to gloss to flatter  more are mens ends marked than their lives before the setting sun and music in the close as the last taste of sweets is sweetest last writ in remembrance more than things long past though richard my lifes counsel would not hear my deaths sad tale may yet undeaf his ear  in the continuation of this dialogue the fatal consequences to a prince of illchosen favorites the danger of suffering foreign fashions and manners to be introduced into a state with an enumerative description of the peculiar advantages of england with regard to its situation and other happy circumstances are strongly pointed out  york his ear is stopped with other flattering charms as praises of his state there are beside lascivious meeters companions or associates in debauch  to whose venomed sound the open ear of youth does always listen report of fashions in proud italy whose manners still our tardy apish nation limps after in base awkward imitation where does the world thrust forth a vanity so it be new there is no respect how vile that is not quickly buzzed into his ears then all too late comes counsel to be heard where will does mutiny with wits regard direct not him whose way himself will choose it is breath thou lackst and that breath will thou lose  lancaster methinks i am a prophet new inspired and thus expiring do foretell of him his rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last for violent fires soon burn out themselves small showers last long but sudden storms are short he tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes with eager feeding food does choke the feeder light vanity insatiate cormorant consuming means soon preys upon itself this royal throne of kings this sceptred isle this earth of majesty this seat of mars this other eden demiparadise this fortress built by nature for herself against infection and the hand of war this happy breed of men this little world this precious stone set in the silver sea which serves it in the office of a wall or as a moat defensive to a house against the envy of less happy lands this nurse this teeming womb of royal kings feared for their breed and famous for their birth for christian service and true chivalry renowned for their deeds as far from home as is the sepulcher in stubborn jewry in the text the word is jury which must be a mistake though it has run through all the editions the alterations and transpositions in the three foregoing lines are copied from doctor johnsons hint  of the worlds ransom blessed marys son this land of such dear souls this dear dear land dear for her reputation through the world is now leased out i die pronouncing it like to a tenement or pelting farm england bound in with the triumphant sea whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege of watery neptune is bound in with shame with inky blots and rotten parchmentbonds that england that was wont to conquer others has made a shameful conquest of itself  the latter part of this speech seems to be as prophetical as the first if we compare it to the state of our national debt  to our stocks  by which we have long since become tenants to foreigners  scene v there are undoubtedly certain notices or premonitions in the order of providence which mankind have been frequently sensible of sometimes from dreams at other times from unaccountable impressions on the mind foreboding particular misfortunes of our lives let philosophy reason against the notion ever so wisely  indeed there appears one argument to oppose this opinion which in any indifferent case might be thought sufficiently able to overthrow it which is that such hints rarely if ever have been found to answer any other purpose than to render us unhappy before our time  but matter of fact is not to be controverted by syllogism the objection only serves to resolve it into a mystery and leaves it still uninvestigable by human science the more of such inexplicable secrets of providence which fall under our observation the better as they may serve to rouse the atheist from his lethargy and afford the deist occasion to suspect at least that what he calls natural religion is not the entire scheme of the divine economy with regard to men there are more things in heaven and earth horatio than are dreamt of in your philosophy hamlet   here follows the passage which gave rise to the above reflection  the queen and bushy bushy madam your majesty is much too sad you promised when you parted from the king to lay aside selfharming heaviness and entertain a cheerful disposition  queen to please the king i did to please myself i cannot do it yet i know no cause why i should welcome such a guest as grief save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest as my sweet richard yet again methinks some unborn sorrow ripe in fortunes womb is coming toward me and my inward soul with something trembles yet at nothing grieves this line is altered for the better by doctor warburton  more than with parting from my lord the king  bushy each substance of a grief has twenty shadows which show like grief itself but are not so for sorrows eye glazed with blinding tears divides one thing entire to many objects like perspectives which rightly gazed upon show nothing but confusion eyed awry distinguish form ang a method of drawing called inverted perspective among the mathematical retions  so your sweet majesty looking awry upon your lords departure finds shapes of grief more than himself to wail which looked on as it is is naught but shadows of what it is not gracious queen then weep not more than your lords departure mores not seen or if it be it is with false sorrows eye which for things true weeps things imaginary  queen it may be so but yet my inward soul persuades me otherwise however it be i cannot but be sad so heavysad as though on thinking on no thought i think makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink  bushy it is nothing but conceit my gracious lady  queen it is nothing less conceit is still derived from some forefather grief mine is not so for nothing has begot my something grief not something has the nothing that i grieve it is in reversion that i do possess that is  has possessed my mind johnson  but what it is that is not yet known what i cannot name is nameless woe i wot  shakespeare has given a description of the same complexion of mind before in the person of anthonio in the merchant of venice see my first remark on the first scene of the first act of that play  scene ix hope has been often termed the assuager of our grief but shakespeare has justly raised it to an higher character by making it an augmentation to our joys also  bolinbroke and hope to joy is little less in joy than hope enjoyed  act iii scene ii the bishop of carlisle endeavoring to awaken the king to a manly exertion of his spirit against the rebellion and neither to trust to the weak defense of right against might nor expect that providence shall out of respect to his divine right fight his battles for him while he looks idly on says the means that heaven yields must be embraced and not neglected else if heaven would and we would not heavens offer we refuse the proffered means of succor and redress   to which the king after expressing a contempt for bolinbroke and his adherents makes a reply agreeable to the vain notion and political superstition of those times with regard to the absurd doctrine of indefeasible right  king not all the water in the rough rude sea can wash the balm from an anointed king the breath of worldly men cannot depose the deputy elected by the lord for every man that bolinbroke has pressed to lift sharp steel against our golden crown heaven for his richard has in heavenly pay a glorious angel then if angels fight weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right  scene iii however he afterward begins to speak more rationally upon this subject for though he appears a little cast down at first yet on hearing some further ill news he rouzes himself again in the following speech king i had forgot myself am i not king awake thou coward majesty thou sleepst is not the kings name fortythousand names there is the same thought in richard the third besides the kings name is a  of strength  arm arm my name a puny subject strikes at thy great glory look not to the ground ye favorites of a king are we not high high be our thoughts    scene iv but this poor abdicating king had no true heroism in his soul for upon the intelligence of some more cross events arriving to him just after he suddenly drops the character of a fighting prince and immediately sinks into that of a preaching priest enter scroop scroop more health and happiness betide my liege than can my caretund tongue deliver him  king mine ear is open and mine heart prepared the worst is worldly loss thou can unfold say is my kingdom lost why twas my care and what loss is it to be rid of care strives bolinbroke to be as great as we greater he shall not be if he serve god well serve him too and be his fellow so revolt our subjects that we cannot mend they break their faith to god as well as us cry woe destruction ruin loss decay the worst is death and death will have his day  this kind of homily he continues afterward in the same scene including however some good reflections on the unstable and unsatisfactory state of mortality even in the highest spheres of life which would have become his confessor better than they did himself as the spirited bishop a true son of the church militant tells him in the close of the following passage  aumerle where is the duke my father with his power  king no matter where  of comfort no man speak  let us talk of graves of worms of epitaphs make dust our paper and with rainy eyes write sorrow on the bosom of the earth let us choose executors and talk of wills and yet not so  for what can we bequeath save our deposed bodies to the ground our lands our lives our all are bolinbrokes and nothing can we call our own but death and that small model of the barren earth which serves as paste and cover to our bones for heavens sake let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings how some had been deposed some slain in war some haunted by the ghosts they dispossessed some poisoned by their wives some sleeping killed in these three lines our author seems to have minuted down notes for his henry vi richard iii macbeth and hamlet  all murdered  for within the hollow crown that rounds the mortal temples of a king keeps death his court and there the antic sits scoshing his state and grinning at his pomp allowing him a breath a little scene to monarchize be feared and kill with looks infusing him with self and vain conceit as if this flesh which walls about our life were brass impregnable and humoured thus comes at the last and with a little pin bores through his castlewalls and farewell king cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood with solemn reverence throw away respect tradition by this expression may be meant the popular superstition of the divine right of kings  form and ceremonious duty for you have but mistook me all this while i live on bread like you feel want like you taste grief need friends like you  subjected thus how can you say to me thou art a king  bishop my lord wise men never wail their present woes but presently prevent the ways to wail to fear the foe since fear oppresses strength gives in your weakness strength unto your foe and so your follies fight against yourself fear and be slain no worse can come from fight and fight and die is death destroying death where fearing dying pays death servile breath  there are several other passages of the same kind in this and the subsequent act where richard alternately rises to a vain confidence in his indefeasible right and then sinks again under a despondency about his fortunes which i shall not disgust the reader with here as the representation of a great man suffering misfortunes meanly is rather an object of contempt than of compassion  in the latter part of this scene upon his finding matters growing worse and worse he exclaims by heaven i will hate him everlastingly that bids me be of comfort any more   doctor johnson has prevented my observation on this passage by a note of his upon it  this sentiment is drawn from nature nothing is more offensive to a mind convinced that its distress is without a remedy and preparing to submit quietly to irresistible calamity than those petty and conjectured comforts which unskilful officiousness thinks it virtue to administer  act v scene i there is something however extremely affecting in what this unhappy man says to his queen upon her lamenting the misery of his situation  king join not with grief fair woman do not so to make my end too sudden  this short sentence lays hold of the heart makes us forget him as a king and feel for him as a man the fondness of his expression too of fair woman increases the tenderness of our regret at the additional unhappiness of their separation  scene ii this poor moralizing prince makes a very just observation here on the nature of all alliances in vice  the king to northumberland northumberland thou ladder wherewithal the mounting bolinbroke ascends my throne the time shall not be many hours of age more than it is ere soul sin gathering head shall break into corruption thou shall think though he divide the realm and give thee half it is too little helping him to all and he shall think that thou who know the way to plant unrightful kings wilt know again being near so little urged another way to pluck him headlong from the usurped throne the love of wicked friends converts to fear that fear to hate and hate turns one or both to worthy danger and deserved death a further and stronger reflection upon such vicious connections occurs in the last scene of this play which i shall bring forward here before its time where exton who had murdered richard brings an account of his great service to bolinbroke  bolinbroke they love not poison that do poison need nor do i thee  though i did wish him dead i hate the murderer love him murdered the guilt of conscience take thou for thy labor but neither my good word nor princely favor with cain go wander through the shade of night and never show thy head by day or light  scene x the following soliloquy in which the state of the mind is compared to that of the world though the thought is rather too much labored deserves to be quoted on account of the beauties it contains the reflections it supplies as well as for the moral compassion and generous resentment with which it is capable of inspiring the virtuous reader for the unhappy speaker  king in prison at pomfret castle i have been studying how to compare this prison where i live unto the world and for because the world is populous and here is not a creature but myself i cannot do it yet i will hammer on it my brain i will prove prove for suppose the female to my soul my soul the father and these two beget a generation of stillbreeding thoughts and these same thoughts people this little world in humor like the people of this world for no thought is contented the better sort as thoughts of things divine are intermixed with scruples and do set the word itself against the word  as thus  come little ones  and then again it is as hard to come as for a camel to bread the pson of a needles eye i do not see how these texts contradict each other they are spoken of different objects children surely may go to heaven though misers may not  thoughts tending to ambition they do plot unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails may tear a passage through the flinty ribs of this hard world my ragged prison walls and for they cannot die in their own pride  thoughts tending to content flatter themselves that they are not the first of fortunes slaves and shall not be the last like silly beggars who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame that many have and others must sit there and in this thought they find a kind of ease bearing their own misfortune on the back of such as have before endured the like thus play i in one prison many people and none contented sometimes am i a king then treason makes me wish myself a beggar and so i am then crushing penury persuades me i was better when a king then am i kingd again and by and by think that i am unkingd by bolinbroke and straight am nothing but whatever i am nor i nor any man that but man is with nothing will be pleased till he be eased with being nothing the last reflection has been so often made and remarked upon before in the course of this work that i shall leave it unnoticed here and so conclude my observations on this play  henry the fourth first part dramatis personae men henry the fourth henry prince of wales earl of worcester hotspur glendower mortimer douglas falstaff women lady percy wife to hotspur lady mortimer henry the fourth first part act i scene i in the first speech here henry the fourth in order to encourage his subjects to attend him with the better spirit on the crusade expedition which he had then resolved upon gives a horrid description of their former state of civil war which the kingdom was happily at that time free from  king no more the thirsty entrails the word in the text is entrance which has puzzled all the commentators i am surprised at it for i think the alteration i have made so obvious that i hardly claim any merit from it of this soil shall trempe soak or sleep her lips with her own childrens blood no more shall trenching war channel her fields nor bruise her flowrets with the armed hoofs of hostile paces those opposed files which like the meteors of a troubled heaven all of one nature of one substance bred did lately meet in the intestine shock and furious close of civil butchery shall now in mutual wellbeseeming ranks march all one way and be no more opposed against acquaintance kindred and allies the edge of war like an illsheathed knife no more shall cut his master  scene ii the method that men take to disguise the nature of their vices by palliating epithets is of dangerous consequences in life it not only serves to blunt the edge of remorse in ourselves but often helps to induce a milder censure in others upon the most flagrant enormities  thus a prostigate fellow who debauches every woman in his power is styled a man of galantry a pennyless adventurer who carries off a rich heiress is called a soldier of fortune a duellist dubbed with the title of a man of honor a sharper un chevalier dindustrie an atheist a freethinker and so forth  a good specimen of this sort of deceitful phraseology is presented to us in part of this scene  falstaff to the prince marry then sweet wag when thou art king let not us that are squires of the nights body be called thieves of the days booty let us be dianas foresters gentlemen of the shade minions of the moon and let them say we be men of good government being governed as the sea is by our noble and chaste mistress the moon under whose countenance we  steal  pistol in some other place says of stealing convey the wise it call merry wives of windsor   scene iii i think i may venture to pronounce for the honor of human nature that the most abandoned person breathing means not to pass his whole life in a state of profligacy he purposes from time to time to take up as the phrase is but is too apt from time to time to procrastinate his amendment thus silencing the clamours of his conscience by the hopeful design of reformation and thinking his repentance sufficiently advanced by a selfconfession of his vice or immorality  the danger of this species of quietism is strongly pointed out in part of a work lately published and as it may afford a useful warning to some of my dissipated readers i shall quote the passage i allude to here  an epitaph on human life eheu fugaces postume p stume labuntur anni hor be early wise lest prudence come too late think how tomorrow steals from us today and leaves the spendthrift further in arrear to purposes unfinished till old time who lends on usury calls in the account and takes the body for its debt unpaid foreclosing life in the insolvent tomb something new  the following speech affords us a beautiful instance of this method of amusing our too flexible and indolent tempers of mind which i copy here with the greater pleasure as the speaker of it did effectually reform his life and manners and has enriched the annals of england with a memoir of true glory  the prince of wales speaking of his loose companions who had just quitted the scene says i know ye all and will awhile uphold the unyoked humor of your idleness yet herein will i imitate the sun who does permit the base contagious clouds to smother up his beauty from the world that when he please again to be himself being wanted he may be more wondered at by breaking through the soul and ugly mists of vapors that did seem to strangle him if all the year were playing holidays to sport would be as tedious as to work but when they seldom come they wished for come and nothing pleases but rare accidents so when this loose behavior i throw off and pay the debt i never promised by how much better than my word i am by so much shall i falsify falsify for exceed doctor johnson mens hopes and like bright metal on a sullen ground my reformation glittering over my fault shall show more goodly and attract more eyes than that which has no soil to set it off i will so offend to make offense a skill redeeming time when men think least i will   scene iv when the brave hotspur is taxed by the king with having refused to surrender the prisoners which he had taken at the gallant action of holmedonmoor to his order the speech he makes upon that occasion in excuse for his refractoriness presents us with a very natural description of the uneasy froward and difficult temper of mind a person is subject to in such circumstances as he paints himself to be at the time mentioned and also entertains us with a character admirably and humorously drawn of a pert foppish and affected court minion the contrast of the two figures here before us would make an excellent picture on canvas  hotspur my liege i did deny no prisoners but i remember when the fight was done when i was dry with rage and extreme toil breathless and faint leaning upon my sword came there a certain lord neat trimly dressed fresh as a bridegroom and his chin new reaped showed like a stubble land at harvest home he was perfumed like a milliner and twixt his finger and his thumb he held a pouncetbox which ever and anon he gave his nose and tookt away again and still he smiled and talked  and as the soldiers bare dead bodies by he called them untaught knaves unmannerly to bring a slovenly unhandsome corse betwixt the wind and his nobility with many holiday and lady terms he questioned me  among the rest demanded my prisoners on your majestys behalf i then all smarting with my wounds grown cold out of my grief and my impatience to be so pestered with a popinjay these lines are transposed as hinted by doctor johnson  answered neglectingly i know not what he should or should not for he made me mad to see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet and talk so like a waiting gentlewoman of guns and drums and wounds  god save the mark and telling me the sovreignest thing on earth was parmacity a corruption of the word spermaei for an inward bruise and that it was great pity so it was that villainous saltpeter should be dug out of the bowels of the harmless earth which many a good tall fellow had destroyed so cowardly and but for these vile guns he would himself have been a soldier  this bold unjointed chat of his my lord i answered indirectly as i said and i beseech you let not this report come current for an accusation betwixt my love and your high majesty  the king not being satisfied with his apology says to him after some prior altercation between them send me your prisoners with the speediest means or you shall hear in such a kind from me as will displease you  send us your prisoners or you will hear of it exit   upon this menace the impatient temper of hotspur breaks out into the following expressions which though the substance of them does not fall within the purpose of this work i shall however repeat here and also continue the dialogue a good deal further as it leads to the character of the speaker which i design to give a description of in the close of my observations on the two next plays  hotspur and if the devil come and roar for them i will not send them i will after strait and tell him so for i will ease my heart although it be with hazard of my head  and again to the same purpose i will keep them all  by heaven he shall not have a scot of them no if a scot would save his soul he shall not  i will keep them by this hand  worcester you start away and lend no ear unto my purposes  those prisoners you shall keep  hotspur i will that is flat  he said he would not ransom mortimer forbad my tongue to speak of mortimer this was in part of the altercation between them in this scene not quoted above  but i will find him when he lies asleep and in his ear i will holla mortimer nay i will have a starling taught to speak nothing but mortimer and give it him to keep his anger still in motion  worcester hear you cousin a word  hotspur all studies here i solemnly defy save how to gall and pinch this bolinbroke and that same swashbuckler the prince of wales but that i think his father loves him not and would be glad he met with some mischance i would have him poisoned with a pot of ale  worcester farewell my kinsman i will talk to you when you are better tempered to attend  northumberland why what a wasptongued and impatient fool art thou to break into this womans mood tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own  hotspur why look you i am whipped and scourged with rods nettled and stung with pismires when i hear of this vile politician bolinbroke in richards time  what do you call the place a plague upon it  it is in glostershire  twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept  his uncle york  where i first bowed my knee unto this king of smiles this bolinbroke when you and he came back from ravenspurg  northumberland at berkley castle  hotspur you say true  why what a deal of candied courtesy this fawning greyhound then did proffe me look when his infant fortune came of age  and gentle harry percy  and kind cousin  the devil take such cozeners  god forgive me  good uncle tell your tale for i have done    the precarious confidence that men can venture to place in unwarrantable services performed for another is well marked in the same scene by one of the disloyal conspirators who had assisted henry to dethrone king richard  worcester for bear ourselves as even as we can the king will always think him in our debt and think we deem ourselves unsatisfied till he has found a time to pay us home  the reader may here refer back to the quotation from the second scene in the fifth act of the former play  act iii scene i in this truly comic scene which may be the rather styled so because there is no buffoonery in it and which i therefore think preferable even to the humor of falstaff the vanity of old glendower in supposing himself to have been a peculiar object of the notice of providence which has however been the foible of several great men caesar etc with the vulgar ignorance of mistaking natural events for miracles is finely contrasted with the careless humor sturdy spirit and rational investigation of hotspur  it would be doing injustice to the dialogue to parcel it out as it refers singly to the several articles above specified therefore i shall entertain my readers with the whole passage entire leaving them to mark the application in their own minds which will occur in their proper places  glendower hotspur worcester and mortimer mortimer these promises are fair the parties sure and our induction beginning or entrance upon action full of prosperous hope  hotspur lord mortimer and cousin glendower will you sit down and uncle worcester  a plague upon it i have forgot the map  glendower no here it is sit cousin percy  sit good cousin hotspur  for by that name as often as lancaster does speak of you his cheek looks pale and with a rising figh he wishes you in heaven  hotspur and you in hell as often as he hears owen glendower spoke of  glendower i blame him not  at my nativity the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes of burning cressets bonfires or any blazing light  know that at my birth the frame and the foundation of the earth shook like a coward  hotspur and so it would have done at the same season if your mothers cat had kittened though yourself had never been born  glendower i say the earth did shake when i was born  hotspur i say the earth then was not of my mind if you suppose as fearing you it shook  glendower the heavens were all on fire the earth did tremble  hotspur o then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire and not in fear of your nativity diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth in strange eruptions and the teeming earth is with a kind of cholic pinched and vexed by the imprisoning of unruly wind within her womb which for enlargement striving shakes the old beldam earth and topples down high towers and mossgrown steeples at your birth our grandam earth with this distemperature in passion shook  glendower cousin of many men i do not bear these crossings give me leave to tell you once again that at my birth the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes the goats ran from the mountains and the herds were strangely clamorous in the frighted fields these signs have marked me extraordinary and all the courses of my life do show i am not in the roll of common men where is he living clipped in with the sea that chides the banks of england wales or scotland who calls me pupil or has read to me and bring him out that is but womans son can trace me in the tedious ways of art or hold me pace in deep experiments  hotspur i think there is no man speaks better welsh  i will to dinner   mortimer peace cousin percy you will make him mad  glendower i can call spirits from the vasty deep  hotspur why so can i or so can any man  but will they come when you do call for them  glendower why i can teach thee to command the devil  hotspur and i can teach thee coz to shame the devil by telling truth  tell uth and shame the devil if thou have power to raise him bring him hither and ill be sworn i have power to shame him hence  o while you live till truth and shame the devil  mortimer come come no more of this unprofitable chat  glendower three times has henry bolinbroke made head against my power thrice from the banks of wye and sandybottomed severn have i sent him bootless home and weatherbeaten back  hotspur home without boots and in soul weather too how escaped he agues in the devils name  glendower come here is the map shall we divide our right according to our threefold order taken  hotspur methink my portion north from burton here in quantity equals not one of yours  see how this river comes me crankling in and cuts me from the best of all my land an huge half moon a monstrous cantle out i will have the current in this place dammed up and here the smug and silver trent shall run in a new channel fair and evenly it shall not wind with such a deep indent to rob me of so rich a bottom here  glendower not wind it shall it must you see it does  hotspur i will have it so a little charge will do it  glendower i will not have it altered  hotspur will not you  glendower no nor you shall not  hotspur who shall say me nay  glendower why that will i  hotspur let me not understand you then speak it in welsh  glendower i can speak english lord as well as you for i was trained up in the english court where being young i framed to the harp many an english ditty lovely well and gave the tongue the english language a helpful ornament a virtue that was never seen in you  hotspur marry and i am glad of it with all my heart  i had rather be a kitten and cry mew than one of these same meter balladmongers i would rather hear a brazen candlestick turned or a dry wheel grate on the axletree and that would nothing set my teeth on edge nothing so much as mincing poetry it is like the forced gait of a shuffling nag  glendower come you shall have trent turned  hotspur i do not care  i will give thrice so much land to any welldeserving friend  but in the way of bargain mark ye me i will cavil on the ninth part of an hair  scene ii again after glendower goes away mortimer fie cousin percy how you cross my father  hotspur i cannot choose sometimes he angers me with telling of the moldwarp and the ant halls chronicles say that some such prediction had induced glendower to rise against henry the fourth  of dreamer merlin and his prophecies and of a dragon and a finless fish a cliptwing griffin and a moulting raven a couching lion and a rampant cat and such a deal of skimble skamble stuff as puts me from my faith i tell you what he held me the last night at least three hours in reckoning up the several devils names that were his lackeys  i cried hum  and well  but marked him not a word  o he is as tedious as a tired horse or as a railing wise worse than a smokey house i would rather live with cheese and garlic welsh fare in a windmill far than seed on caes vands or savoury meats and have him talk to me in any summer house in christendom    scene iii here is a beautiful description given of that most pleasing crisis of mind and body between sleeping and waking when the passions are just subsiding to rest but the senses not yet deprived of their notices  lady mortimer daughter to glendower not being able to speak any language but welsh to her husband which he does not understand the father undertakes to interpret between them  mortimer o i am ignorance itself in this  glendower she bids you all on the wanton rushes lay you down and rest your gentle head upon her lap and she will sing the song that pleases you and on your eyelids crown the god of sleep charming your blood with pleasing heaviness making such difference betwixt wake and sleep as is the difference betwixt day and night the hour before the heavenly harnessed team begins his golden progress in the east  there is neither metreballadmongers stuff nor mincing poetry in the above speech if glendower is not original in it he has at least the merit of a good translator  a little further on in the same scene the usual expletives of conversation and childish phrases of asseveration are humorously turned into ridicule  after lady mortimer has sung her welsh song hotspur in order to amuse his mind then pondering on momentous intents says to his wife come i will have your song too lady percy not mine in good sooth  hotspur not yours in good sooth why you swear like a comfitmakers wife  not you in good sooth and as true as i live and as god shall mend me and as sure as day and give such sarcenet surety for thy oaths as if thou had never walked further than finsbury  swear me kate like a lady as thou art a good mouthfilling oath and leave in sooth and such protest of pepper gingerbread this is but an odd sort of simile for a mild note of affirmation the commentators neither explain the meaning nor confess their ignorance about it it is easy to be a critic on these terms  to velvet guards and sunday citizens come sing    scene iv this whole scene is so beautiful so spirited and so affecting that it would be a massacre in literature to fever its members asunder which i should lay myself under the barbarous necessity of doing were the several sentiments observations and reflections which naturally arise from it suffered to challenge their several references separately i shall therefore serve up the compact body of it unbroken before the reader and leave the dissection of its parts to his own judgment taste and feeling  let the father who has an untoward son here learn how best to reprove let the youth whose virtues are obscured by his errors be instructed how to reform let the sovereign who would preserve his dignity be hence taught how to maintain it and the king whose soibles have rendered him the object of contempt be herein warned of the dangerous consequences of his becoming despised  the king and the prince of wales king i know not whether god will have it so for some displeasing service i have done that in his secret doom out of my blood he will breed revengement and a scourge for me but thou do in thy passages of life make me believe that thou art only marked for the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven to punish my mistreadings tell me else could such inordinate and low desires such poor such base such lewd such mean attaints such barren pleasures rude society as thou art matched withal and grafted to accompany the greatness of thy blood and hold their level with thy princely heart  prince so please your majesty i would i could quit all offenses with as clear excuse as well as i am doubtless i can purge myself of many i am charged withal yet such extenuation let me beg as on reproof of many tales devised which often the ear of greatness needs must hear by smiling pickthanks and base newsmongers i may for some things true wherein my youth has faulty wandered and irregular find pardon on my true submission  king heaven pardon thee yet let me wonder harry at thy affections which do hold a wing quite from the flight of all thy ancestors thy place in council thou have rudely lost which by thy younger brother is supplied and art almost an alien to the hearts of all the court and princes of my blood the hope and expectation of thy time is mined and the soul of every man prophetically does forethink thy fall had i so lavish of my presence been so common hackneyed in the eyes of men so stale and cheap to vulgar company opinion that did help me to the crown had still kept loyal to possession true to the late king richard the second  and left me in reputeless banishment a fellow of no mark or likelihood but being seldom seen i could not stir but like a comet i was wondered at that men would tell their children this is he others would say where which is bolinroke and then i stole all courtesy from heaven alluding to the theft of prometheus  and dressed myself in such humility that i did pluck allegiance from mens hearts loud shouts and salutations from their mouths even in the presence of the crowned king thus i did keep my person fresh and new my presence like a robe pontifical never seen but wondered at and so my state seldom but sumptuous showed like a feast and won by rareness such solemnity the skipping king he ambled up and down with shallow jesters and rash bavin bavin a sort of slight fuel that catches fire quickly but wants substance to preserve it long wits soon kindled and soon burnt scarded his state mingled his royalty with carping fools had his great name profaned with their scorns and gave his countenance against his name sunk his dignity in mean familiarity  to laugh at gibing boys and stand the push of every beardless vain comparative comparative  any idle companion that would set himself on a level with him  grew a companion to the common streets enfeoffd himself to popularity gave the livery and seizin of his person away by exposing it too frequently to the public view  that being daily swallowed by mens eyes they surfeited with honey and began to loath a taste of sweetness whereof a little more than a little is by much too much they deny shakespeare to have been a classic scholar but one would fancy that he was both a master and admirer of ovid by the manly and puerile style he frequently mixes together in the same passage as in this instance for one among many  so when he had occasion to be seen he was but as the cuckoo is in june heard not regarded seen but with such eyes as sick and blunted with community afforded no extraordinary gaze such as is bent on sunlike majesty when it shines seldom in admiring eyes but rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down slept in his face and rendered such aspect as cloudy men use to their adversaries being with his presence glutted gorged and full and in that very line harry standst thou for thou have lost thy princely privilege with vile participation not an eye but is aweary of thy common sight save mine which has desired to see thee more which now does what i would not have it do make blind itself with foolish tenderness  prince i shall hereafter my most gracious lord be more myself  king for all the world as thou art at this hour was richard then when i from france set foot at ravenspurg and even as i was then is percy now now by my scepter and my soul to boot he has more worthy interest in the state than thou the shadow of succession that is worth and the affections of the people are stronger pretensions to empire than hereditary title alone unsupported by virtue  for of no right nor color like to right he does fill fields with harness harness  armor or coats of mail  in the realm turns head against the lions armed jaws and being no more in debt to years than thou leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on to bloody battles and to bruising arms what neverdying honor has he got against renowned douglas whose high deeds whose hot incursions and great name in arms hold from all soldiers chief majority and military title capital through all the kingdoms that acknowledge christ thrice has this hotspur mars in swathing clothes this infant warrior in his enterprises discomfited great douglas taken him once enlarged him and made a friend of him to fill the mouth of deep defiance up and shake the peace and safety of our throne and what say you to this percy northumberland the archbishops grace of york douglas and mortimer confederate against us and are up but wherefore do i tell this news to thee why harry do i tell thee of my foes which art my nearest dearest for most fatal and dearest enemy thou that art like enough through vassal fear base inclination or the start of spleen spleen shakespeare uses this word in a sense peculiar to himself for sudden hasty and rash  in the midsummer nights dream he applies it to lightning  brief as the lightning in the collied night that in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth   to fight against me under percys pay to dog his heels and curtsie at his frown to show how much thou art degenerate  prince do not think so  you shall not find it so  and heaven forgive them that so much have swayed your majestys good thoughts away from me i will redeem all this on percys head and in the closing of some glorious day be bold to tell you that i am your son when i will wear a garment all of blood and stain my favors in a bloody mask which washed away shall scower my shame with it  and that shall be the day when ever it lights that this same child of honor and renown this gallant hotspur this all praised knight and your unthought of harry chance to meet  for every honor sitting on his helm would they were multitudes and on my head my shames redoubled for the time will come that i shall make this northern youth exchange his glorious deeds for my indignities percy is but my factor good my lord to engross up glorious acts on my behalf and i will call him to so strict account that he shall render every glory up yea even the slightest worship of his time or i will tear the reckoning from his heart this in the name of heaven i promise here the which if i perform and do survive i do beseech your majesty may salve the longgrown wounds of my intemperance if not the end of life cancels all bonds and i will die an hundred thousand deaths ere break the smallest parcel of this vow  king an hundred thousand rebels die in this thou shall have charge and sovereign trust herein our hands are full of business  let us away advantage feeds him fat while men delay  there is hardly a line in the above speech of the king that is not worth the whole of what sophocles makes oedipus say to his son in the same circumstances but i dont expect that the learned will ever give up this point to me while one passage remains in greek and the other only in english  scene i the nobleness of hotspurs character is admirably sustained throughout this play the following speech shows a fine part of it hotspur to douglas well said my noble scot if speaking truth in this fine age were not thought flattery such attribution should the douglas have as not a soldier of this seasons stamp should go so general current through the world by heaven i cannot flatter i defy the tongues of soothers but a braver place in my hearts love has no man than yourself  nay task me to my word approve me lord   the precarious and critical situation of unwarrantable and hazardous undertakings is well reflected upon in the following passage of the same scene when the conspirators are informed that northumberland is prevented by sickness from attending the rendezvous worcester to hotspur but yet i would your father had been here the quality and hair of our attempt brooks no division the quality and hair of our attempt books no division  the commentator by the word hair in this place understands complexion or character and finds fault with the harshness of the metaphor but i think from the last part of the sentence that the poet meant the expression literally worcester compares the stightness of their cause to a single hair which is a thing of too subtle a nature to bear being divided    it will be thought by some that know not why he is away that wisdom loyalty and mere dislike of our proceedings kept the earl from hence  and think how such an apprehension may turn the tide of fearful faction and breed a kind of question in our cause for well you know we of the offending side must keep aloof from strict arbitrament and stop all sightholes every loop from whence the eye of reason may pry in upon us this absence of your father draws a curtain that shows the ignorant a kind of fear before not dreamt upon   the gallant spirit of hotspur is well shown in his reply you strain too far i rather of his absence make this use  it lends a luster and more great opinion a larger dare to our great enterprise than if the earl were here for men must think if we without his help can make a head to push against the kingdom with his aid we shall oerturn it topsyturvy down yet all goes well yet all our joints are whole   upon this occasion douglas makes a boast which though intended by him as an exclusive compliment to his own nation may be challenged as the general characteristic of great britain at large  douglas in continuation of hotspurs speech as heart can think  there is not such a word spoke of in scotland as this term of fear   act v scene i upon a parley or convention held between the chiefs of the two parties worcester enumerates the several grievances of the nation that had induced the percy family to rise in arms for redress in reply to these charges the king gives a very just account of the nature pretenses and artifices of rebellion  king these things indeed you have articulated proclaimed at marketcrosses read in churches to face the garment of rebellion with some fine color that may please the eye of fickle changelings and poor discontents which gape and rub the elbow at the news of hurlyburly innovation and never yet did insurrection want such watercolors to impaint its cause nor moody beggars starving for a time of pellmell havoc and confusion  the liberal mind and brave heart of the prince of wales are beautifully marked in the following speech where he makes a generous encomium on hotspur and sends him a spirited defiance to single combat at the same time  prince to worcester in both our armies there is many a soul shall pay full dearly for this bold encounter if once they join in trial tell your nephew the prince of wales does join with all the world in praise of henry percy by my hopes this present enterprise set off his head i do not think a braver gentleman more activevaliant or more valiantyoung more daring or more bold is now alive to grace this latter age with noble deed for my part i may speak it to my shame i have a truant been to chivalry and so i hear he does account me too yet this before my fathers majesty  i am content that he shall take the odds of his great name and estimation and will to save the blood on either side try fortune with him in a single fight scene ii the arguments of cowardice are whimsically discussed and exposed in the following passage the prince just as he goes out says to falstaff why thou owe heaven a death upon which the fat knight takes occasion to hold this humorous soliloquy with himself falstaff it is not due yet  i would be loath to pay him before his day what need i be so forward with him that calls not on me well it is no matter honor pricks me on but how if honor pricks me off again when i come on can honor set to a leg no  or an arm no  or take away the grief of a wound no honor has no skill in surgery then no  what is honor a word  what is that word honor air  a trim reckoning  who has it he that died on wednesday does he feel it no  does he hear it no  is it insensible then yea to the dead  but will it not live with the living no  why detraction will not suffer it therefore i will none of it  honor is but a mere scutcheon the hatchment placed over the door of a person deceased  and so ends my catechism     scene iii when the king has made the proffer of a general amnesty to the conspirators the natural distrust and diffidence which rebels must ever labor under is well descanted upon in this scene  worcester it is not possible it cannot be the king should keep his word in loving us he will suspect us still and find a time to punish this offense in other faults suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes for treason is but trusted like a fox who never so tame so cherished and locked up will have a wild trick of his ancestors look how we can or sad or merrily interpretation will misquote our looks and we shall feed like oxen at a stall the better cherished still the nearer death  if the reader will take the trouble to revert to the last observation on the fourth scene in the first act of this play he will meet with a like reflection there made by the same person this repetition is a stroke of nature given us by the poet to show the perturbation of spirits and distrust of mind which persons in his situation are ever sensible of but indeed this reflection may more generally be applied to every species of vice for in guilt there can be no peace within nor confidence without  scene ix the magnanimity of the prince of wales is preserved throughout his character after he has slain hotspur he makes his elegy in these words prince brave percy  fare thee well great heart illweaved ambition a metaphor taken from cloth which shrinks when it is woven with too loose a contexture johnson  how much art thou shrunk when that this body did contain a spirit a kingdom for it was too small a bound but now two paces of the vilest earth is room enough this earth that bears thee dead beas not alive so stout a gentleman  if thou were sensible of courtesy i should not make so great a show of zeal  but let my favor hide thy mangled form and even in thy behalf i thank myself for doing these fair rites of tenderness throwing his scarf over him adieu and take thy praise with thee to heaven thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave but not remembered in thy epitaph    postscript i thought that my task was done with this play when i had got to the end of it but there is something so very great singular and attractive in the two principal characters of this historic piece that i find a pleasure in keeping them still in view and contemplating them both in my mind  whenever hotspur or the prince filled the scene which they are either of them singly sufficient to do i confess that my heart was sensible of such an emotion as sir philip sidney said he used to be affected with on a perusal of the old ballad of chevychase as if he had heard the sound of a trumpet perhaps the following observation may better account for my impulse  women are apt to esteem the ancient virtue of courage at an higher rate than men in general are and this for these two especial reasons the first that it is peculiarly necessary to their personal defense and the next that their weakness induces them to form a sublimer notion of this quality than the stronger and therefore braver sex may naturally be supposed to compliment it with men feeling the principles of it in their own breasts conceive no very supernatural idea of it while women having no such premises to reason from look on it as something more than human  these reflections with the frequent occasions i have had thoughout this play of comparing the two heroes of it with each other have tempted me to undertake a parallel between them after the manner of plutarch which however i did not mean to have given the reader as hinted above till i should come to the end of the second play after this where our author has concluded all he had to say about henry the fifth  but as shakespeare has opened enough of this princes character here to supply sufficient materials for the comparison and that his unfortunate rival is just slain i thought the parallel might have a better effect on the mind of my readers in this place than it would be likely to produce after the delay had suffered the impression of hotspurs qualities to wear out of their remembrance  a parallel between hotspur and henry prince of wales they are both equally brave but the courage of hotspur has a greater portion of fierceness in it  the princes magnanimity is more heroic the first resembles achilles the latter is more like hector the different principles too of their actions help to form and justify this distinction as the one invades and the other defends a right hotspur speaks nobly of his rival douglas to his face but after he is become his friend the prince does the same of hotspur behind his back and while he is still his enemy  they both of them possess a sportive vein of humor in their scenes of common life but hotspur still preserves the surly and refractory haughtiness of his character throughout even in the relaxations he indulges himself in the prince has more of ease and nature in his delivering himself over to mirth and dissipation without reserve hotspurs festivity seems to resemble that of hamlet as assumed merely to relieve anxiety of mind and cover sanguinary purposes the princes gaiety like that of faulconbridge in king john  appears to be more genuine arising from natural temper and an healthful flow of spirits the prince is alcibiades  percy is  himself  there is likewise another character in this rich play of a most peculiar distinction as being not only original but inimitable also  no copy of it has ever since appeared either in life or description any one of the dramatis personae in congreves comedies or indeed in most of the modern ones might repeat the wit or humor of the separate parts with equal effect on the audience as the person to whose role they are appropriated but there is a certain characteristic peculiarity in all the humor of falstaff that would sound flatly in the mouths of bardolph poins or peto in fine the portrait of this extraordinary personage is delineated by so masterly a hand that we may venture to pronounce it to be the only one that ever afforded so high a degree of pleasure without the least pretense to merit or virtue to support it  i was obliged to pass by many of his strokes of humor character and description because they did not fall within the rule i had prescribed to myself in these notes but i honestly confess that it was with regret whenever i did so for were there as much moral as there certainly is physical good in laughing i might have transcribed every scene of his throughout this the following play and the merry wives of windsor for the advantage of the health as well as the entertainment of my readers  henry the fourth second part dramatis personae men the king prince of wales prince john of lancaster humphrey of gloucester thomas of clarence earl of northumberland against the king archbishop of york against the king lord bardolph against the king morton against the king earl of warwick for the king lord chief justice for the king sir john falstaff bardolph poins pistol women lady percy widow of hotspur doll tearsheet henry the fourth second part act i scene iii the quick eye of suspicion with the prophetic nature of anxious apprehensions are well marked here the latter is a species of that kind of foreboding often unaccountably arising in the mind which i have taken notice of in former places richard ii act ii scene v and merchant of venice act i scene i first remark   northumberland lord bardolph and morton morton giving an account of the action at shrewsbury says to northumberland douglas is living and your brother yet but for my lord your son    here northumberland hastily interrupts him why he is dead  see what a ready tongue suspicion has he that but fears the thing he would not know has by instinct knowledge from others eyes that what he feared is chanced bardolph yet for all this say not that percys dead northumberland to morton i see a strange confession in thine eye thou shakst thy head and holdst it fear or sin to speak a truth if he be slain say so the tongue offends not that reports his death and he does sin that does belie the dead not he that says the dead is not alive  morton yet the first bringer of unwelcome news has but a losing office and his tongue sounds ever after as a sullen bell remembered tolling a departed the word in the text is departing friend    i was just going to observe upon the latter part of this dialogue when i happened to recollect that i had already taken notice of a parallel passage in my second remark on the first scene of the third act of king john and to which i beg leave to refer my reader  the human mind when roused by danger or inflamed with passion is capable of inspiring the brave heart with additional courage and of supplying new vigor to exhausted strength this admirable economy in the human frame is contrived by nature as being necessary to selfdefence as well as in order to render injury the more difficult and hazardous to the offender  northumberland for this i shall have time enough to mourn in poison there is physic and this news that would had i been well have made me sick being ck has in some measure made me well and as the wretch whose feverweakened joints like strengthless hinges buckle under life impatient of his fit breaks like a fire out of his keepers arms even so my limbs weakened with grief being now enraged with grief are thrice themselves hence therefore thou nice crutch a scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel must glove this hand  and hence thou sickly quoif thou art a guard too wanton light or effeminate for the head which princes flushed with conquest aim to hit now bind my brows with iron and approach the ruggedst hour that time and spite dare bring to frown upon the enraged northumberland let heaven kiss earth now let not natures hand keep the wild flood confined let order die and let this world no longer be a stage to feed contention in a lingering act but let one spirit of the firstborn cain reign in all bosoms that each heart being set on bloody courses the rude scene may end and darkness be the burier of the dead  i have continued this speech for eight lines further than my preface to it required but i thought the whole spirit and language of it too fine to suffer it to be mangled by stopping short besides this latter part of it shows that extravagance of despair and rage to which grief resentment and misfortune are apt to drive a person whose mind is not happily tempered by philosophy or restrained by religion  see the second remark with the passage it refers to in the first scene of act the fourth of the preceding play as it will save me the trouble of making a new observation here or of repeating the same again as applicable to the following speech morton my lord your son had only but the corpse but shadows and the shows of men to fight for that same word rebellion did divide the action of their bodies from their souls and they did fight with queasiness constrained as men drink potions that their weapons only seemed on our side but for their spirits and souls this word rebellion it had froze them up as fish are in a pond    scene vi there is a most disgusting picture but a too historically just one given in this place of the unstable and fluctuating affections of the multitude  no popularity can be permanent which is not earned by virtue and preserved by perseverance in it the public is a weathercock it continues steady only while the wind remains so when that shifts the vane turns also  york let us on and publish the occasion of our arms the commonwealth is sick of their own choice their overgreedy love has surfeited an habitation giddy and unsure has he that builds on the vulgar heart o thou fond many with what loud applause did thou beat heaven with blessing bolinbroke before he was what thou would have him be and now being trimmed up in thine own desires thou beastly feeder art so full of him that thou provokest thyself to cast him up so so thou common dog did thou disgorge thy glutton bosom of the royal richard and now thou would eat thy dead vomit up and howlst to find it what trust is in these times they that when richard lived would have him die are now become enamoured of his grave thou that threw dust upon his goodly head when through proud london he came sighing on after the admired heels of bolinbroke criest now o earth yield us that king again and take thou this o thoughts of men accursed past and to come seem best things present worst  act ii scene iv the extravagant and superstitious notions of the vulgar in former times with regard to kings and heroes though not really supposed in this scene are however very humorously ridiculed in it  the prince and poins prince trust me i am exceeding weary   poins and is it come to that i had thought that weariness durst not have attacked one of so high blood   prince it does me though it discolours the complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it does it not show vilely in me now to desire small beer   poins why a prince should not be so loosely studied as to remember so weak a composition   prince belike then my appetite was not princely got for in troth i do now remember the poor creature small beer but indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with my greatness what a disgrace is it in me now to remember thy name or to know thy face tomorrow or to take note how many pair of silk stockings thou have videlicet these and those that were once the peachcoloured ones  or to bear the inventory of thy shirts as one for use and another for superfluity   that common disposition of vaunting ourselves above others so natural to mankind that some writer styles it a mint at every ones tongues end to coin their own praise is well marked in the latter part of this scene but i shall commence the dialogue a little earlier than may be just necessary to this reference in order to treat my reader with a beautiful trait in the princes character who is made to preserve his virtue untainted in the midst of all his debauchery and dissipation  poins being piqued at the princes having exposed the shabbiness of his wardrobe replies poins how ill it follows after you have labored so hard you should talk so idly tell me how many good young princes would do so their fathers lying so sick as yours at this time is   prince shall i tell thee one thing poins   poins yes and let it be an excellent good thing   prince it shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine   poins go to i stand the push of your one thing that you will tell   prince why i tell thee it is not meet that i should be sad now my father is sick albeit i could tell thee as to one it pleases me for fault of a better to call my friend i could be sad and very sad indeed too   poins very hardly upon such a subject   prince by this hand thou think me as far in the devils book as thou and falstaff for obduracy and persistency let the end try the man but i tell thee my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick and keeping such vile company as thou art has in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow   poins the reason   prince what would thou think of me if i should weep   poins i would think thee a most princely hypocrite   prince it would be every mans thought and thou art a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks never a mans thought in the world keeps the roadway better than thine every man would think me an hypocrite indeed and what excites your most worshipful thought to think so   poins why because you have seemed so lewd and so much ingrafted to falstaff   prince and to thee   poins nay by this light i am well spoken of i can hear it with my own ears the worst they can say of me is that i am a second brother and that i am a proper fellow of my hands this was an expression in those times for a person forward in fighting  and those two things i confess i cannot help     the delicacy of the princes difficulty upon this occasion in not being able to manifest the concern he was really sensible of for his fathers illness lest from the former complexion of his life and manners he might be suspected of insincerity in such professions must have a fine effect on the sentiment of a reader who is possessed of the least refinement of principle or virtue  a most useful lesson might be framed upon the very singular character of this amiable person the pattern is not perfect and therefore  shall i venture to say it the example is the better for that reason his manners are idle but his morals incorrupt he suffers falstaff to make as free with him as he pleases but breaks his head as mrs quickly tells us in a former scene for his having thrown out a jest upon his father young men may learn from him never to be guilty of more vice than the temptation to it might precipitate them into he connives at the robbery of his companions for the diversion of playing the same game upon them again but resolves to make ample restitution for the wrong see the last scene of act ii in the first part of this play  he offends his father by the dissoluteness of his conduct but his filial affection and respect are still unremitted toward him he shows a spirit of justice in injustice and of duty even in disobedience  i here offer this comment as a supplement to the character i have already drawn of this prince at the end of the former play i could not have fairly added it there as any thing that did not immediately relate to the comparison between him and hotspur would have been improperly introduced in the parallel  scene v the vanity with which men are apt to plume themselves with regard to titles of honor to which they can claim no merit in themselves is humorously ridiculed here by poins in his notes on falstaffs letter to the prince which is given him to read  poins reading john falstaff knight every man must know that as often as he has occasion to name himself even like those that are akin to the king for they never prick their finger but they cry there is some of the kings blood spilt  how comes that says he that takes upon him not to conceive it the answer is as ready as a borrowers cap always cap in hand to his creditor  i am the kings poor cousin sir   prince nay they will be akin to us or they will fetch it from japhet   scene vi the servile adulation usually paid to great or distinguished persons even to an imitation of their very defects and which alexander properly reprehended by giving a box on the ear to one of his courtiers who had mimicked the wryness of his neck is well represented here  lady percy speaking of hotspur he was indeed the glass wherein the noble youth did dress themselves he had no legs that practiced not his gait and speaking thick might we not venture to substitute the word quick in this passage as being better opposed to the description in the second line following of low and tardily  those who speak quick generally speak loud also which compleats the opposition  which nature made his blemish became the accents of the wouldbe valiant for those that could speak low and tardily would turn their own perfection to abuse to seem like him so that in speech and gait in diet in affections of delight in military rules humors of blood he was the mark and glass copy and book that fashioned others   in the last passage of this scene the uncertain and irresolute deliberation of mind in which men are apt to be held in suspense upon the crisis of doubtful adventures is well described by an apt simile  northumberland it is with my mind as with the tide swelled up unto its height that makes a still stand running neither way fain would i go to meet the archbishop y then up in arms on his side  but many thousand reasons hold me back i will resolve for scotland there am i till time and vantage crave my company  scene x in this scene doll makes a speech that is worthy to be remarked upon when pistol is styled captain she says captain thou abominable damned cheater art thou not ashamed to be called captain if captains were of my mind they would truncheon you out of taking their names upon you before you have earned them a captain these villains will make the word captain odicus  therefore captains had need look to it  there is a punctilio of the kind hinted at here already established in the army but it is confined only to one article namely courage if an officer declines a challenge or suffers an affront to pass unresented his corpse refuse to roll with him it would be better if this pont of honor respected the moral as well as the natural part of a soldiers character and better still if the same spirit and virtue were exerted in every class or distinction of life among lords commoners lawyers parsons and physicians a rule of this sort would go further toward the reformation of manners than all the laws and preachments that ever were made  scene xi the slght merits and superficial accomplishments which too often connect young persons in fellowship with each other are here well exposed when fortune is whirling her wheel about the turning of a tobaccostopper or of a straw may make a man according to trinculos expression in the tempest   falstaff and doll tearsheet doll sirrah what humor is the prince of   falstaff a good shallow young fellow he would have made a good pantler he would have chipped bread well   doll they say poins has a good wit   falstaff he a good wit hang him baboon his wit is as thick as tewksbury mustard there is no more conceit in him than is in a mallet   doll why does the prince love him so then   falstaff because their legs are both of a bigness and he plays at quoits well and eats conger and fennel as i know of no story that this circumstance can be applied to it may be supposed to allude to the particular taste for it is far from a general one of the prince which poins might have adopted as lady percy says the flatterers of hotspur affected him even in his diet from which hint i should think that a senneleater would be a better expression for fawners than toad eater because the authority of the phrase is better as being vouched by this passage  and drinks off candles ends for flapdragons this article i can only explain by another boyish trick called making fireships an almond is lighted put into a glass of any liquor and swallowed down before the flame is extinguished  and rides the wild mare with the boys and jumps over joint stools and swears with a good grace and wears his boot very smooth like the sign of the leg and breeds no bate with telling of indiscreet stories and such other gambol faculties he has that show a weak mind and an able body for the which the prince admits him for he is himself such another the weight of an hair would turn the scales between their avoirdupois   act iii scene i in the fine speech which fills this scene the anxieties of the great with the content of the commonalty the difference between the labor of the mind and that of the body are beautifullly contrasted and most poetically compared  the king alone in his nightgown how many thousands of my poorest subjects are at this hour asleep o gentle sleep natures soft nurse how have i frighted thee that thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down and steep my senses in forgetfulness why rather sleep lie thou in smoky cribs upon uneasy pallets stretching thee and hushed with buzzing nightflies to thy slumber than in the perfumed chambers of the great under the canopies of costly state and lulled with sounds of sweetest melody o thou dull god why lie thou with the vile in loathsome beds and leave the kingly couch a watchcase a sentrybox to which was fixed an alarm bell that the sentinel was to ring in order to give notice of any attack on his post  or a common larumbeil will thou upon the high and giddy mast seal up the shipboys eyes and rock his brains in cradle of the rude imperious surge and in the visitation of the winds who take the ruffian billows by the top curling their monstrous heads and hanging them with deafning clamours in the slippery shrouds that with the hurley death itself awakes can thou o partial sleep give thy repose to the wet seaboy in an hour so rude and in the calmest and the stillest night with all appliances and means to boot deny it to a king then happy lowly clown uneasy lies the head that wears a crown scene ii there is a sad because a too true prospect of human life presented to us here which justifies the goodness of providence and vindicates the ways of god to man in hiding the future from our view quid sit futurum cras fuge quaerere  all the knowledge that is necessary to true wisdom the entire volume of morality and devotion lies open before us the contingencies of events only of little import upon the whole of our existence being veiled from our sight  heaven from all creatures hides the book of fate all but the page prescribed their present state from brutes what men from men what spirits know or who could suffer being here below popes essay on man were we capable of foreseeing effects in their causes and admitted to peer through the telescope of time it would more frequently and generally make us unhappy before our sufferings would render the future and precarious evil present and certain dull the sense of anticipated good by giving us enjoyment before possession hope the enhancer of expected bliss would be lost in assurance and that dear cordial of despair be then struck off from the materia medica of affliction  cicero speaks finely upon this subject i forget the place but it is where he supposes priam pompey and caesar to have had their several pages in the book of fate laid open before them in the height of their prosperity  the king warwick and surry king oh heaven that one might read the book of fate and see the revolution of the times make mountains level and the continent weary of solid firmness melt itself into the sea and other times to see the beachy girdle of the ocean too wide for neptunes hips how chances mock and changes fill the cup of alteration with diverse liquors o if this were seen the happiest youth viewing his progress through what perils pressed the word is past in the text about which the commentators raise a difficulty but dont remove it i hope that this mere verbal alteration will obviate the objection and supposing it to have been spelt pressed in the original manuscript the transcriber might easily have made the mistake  what crosses to ensue would shut the book and sit him down and die  it is not ten years gone since richard and northumberland great friends did feast together and in two years after were they at wars it is but eight years since this percy was the man nearest my soul who like a brother toiled in my affairs and laid his love and life under my foot yea for my sake even to the eyes of richard gave him defiance but which of you was by you cousin nevil as i may remember to warwick when richard with his eye brimful of tears this line is very affecting shakespeares humanity prompted him to make this unfortunate prince appear an object of compassion even where he is not exhibited in the scene by describing a circumstance that was no otherwise necessary to this passage  then checked and rated by northumberland did speak these words now proved a prophecy  northumberland thou ladder by the which my cousin bolinbroke ascends my throne though then heaven knows i had no such intent but that necessity so bowed the state that i and greatness were compelled to kiss this is sometimes the case but always the pretense for usurpation   the time will come thus did he follow it the time will come that foul sin gathering head shall break into corruption so went on foretelling this same times condition and the division of our amity  however the reply to this reflection says very justly that in many cases the ignorance of the future may be often supplied by those who have made proper observations on past experience and are capable of forming judgments upon character  warwick there is an history in all mens lives figuring the nature of the times deceased the which observed a man may prophecy with a near aim of the main chance of things as not yet come to life which in their seeds and weak beginnings lie intreasured such things become the hatch and brood of time and by the necessary form of them king richard might create a perfect guess that great northumberland then false to him would of that seed grow to a greater falseness which should not find a ground to root upon unless on you  scene iii the usual prate or as hotspur phrases it the bald unjointed chat of old fellows among their cotemporaries the fond and vain boastings of their youthful frolics and their trite reflections intermixed at the same time with a particular attention to their own interests are all most excellently well displayed in this scene which i have a double purpose in laying before the reader to warn the old from rendering themselves tedious or ridiculous by such foibles and also to incline the young to show some tenderness to natural weaknesses arising not from the peculiarities of the persons being characteristical only of respectful years and timehonoured age this is an epithet of shakespeares own framing richard ii act i scene i   shallow and silence two justices meeting shallow come on come on come on give me your hand sir an early stirrer by the rood the cross  and how does my good cousin silence   silence good morrow good cousin shallow   shallow and how does my cousin your bedfellow and your fairest daughter and mine my goddaughter ellen   silence alas a black ousel ousel is a blackbird but why he calls her so i cannot tell unless it be in opposition to shallows complimenting her with the epithet of fair  cousin shallow   shallow by yea and nay sir i dare say my cousin william is become a good scholar he is at oxford still is he not   silence indeed sir to my cost   shallow he must then to the inns of court shortly i was once of clements inn where i think they will talk of mad shallow yet   silence you were called lusty shallow then cousin   shallow i was called any thing and i would have done any thing indeed too and roundly too there was i and little john doit of staffordshire and black george barc and francis pickbone and will squelt a cotswold man you had not four such swingebucklers swinge buckler this is the only place where we meet with this epithet for a rioter or bully or indeed for any thing else in all other authors before or since that era the word used for this purpose is swashbuckler and properly so for the first part of the compound where the character lies is fully described by the expression of swash upon shakespeares own authority having severally applied it in such a sense in other places to swash a swasher for to swagger a swggerer  but swinge so far from supplying the meaning here intended conveys no sort of idea at all that i can conceive the expression of swashbuckler is made use of applied to the prince of wales by hotspur in the fourth scene of act i first part of this play in all the inns of court again and i may say to you we knew where the bonarobas were and had the best of them all at commandment then was jack falstaff now sir john a boy and page to thomas mowbray duke of norfolk   silence this sir john cousin that comes hither anon about soldiers   shallow the same sir john the very same i saw him break schoggans head at the court gate when he was a crack not thus high and the very same day did i fight with one sampson stockfish a fruiterer behind grays inn o the mad days that i have spent and to see how many of my old acquaintance are dead   silence we shall all follow cousin   shallow certain it is certain very sure very sure death as the psalmist says is certain to all all shall die how go a good yoke of bullocks at stamfora fair   silence truly cousin i was not there   shallow death is certain is old double of your town living yet   silence dead sir   shallow dead  see see  he drew a good bow  and dead he shot a fine shoot john of gaunt loved him well and betted much money on his head dead  he would have clapped in the clowt at twelve score and carried you a forehand shaft a

as they be a score of good ewes may be worth ten pounds   shallow and is old double dead   scene iv the ridicule in the following passage is directed against the affectation of using what the vulgar call hard words in familiar conversation with the synonimous explications of ignorance by throwing the same word into different tenses or cases as if the sense of it could be hit off by the repetition of its own sound  bardolph and shallow bardolph my captain sir commends him to you my captain sir john falstaff a tall gentleman by heaven and a most gallant leader   shallow he greets me well sir i knew him a good backsword man how does the good knight may i ask how my good lady his wife does   bardolph sir pardon a soldier is better accommodated than with a wife   shallow it is well said sir and it is well said indeed too  better accommdated  it is good yea indeed is it  good phrases surely are and ever were very commendable accommodated  it comes of accommodo  very good a good phrase   bardolph pardon me sir i have heard the word phrase call you it by this day i know not the phrase but i will maintain the word with my sword to be a soldierlike word and a word of exceeding good command accommodated  that is when a man is as they say accommodated or when a man is being whereby he may be thought to be accommodated which is an excellent thing   act iv scene viii there is a striking description given of the prince here which does honor likewise to the speaker parents in general while they are fond of their children are apt either to see them without blemish or when they are offended with them to show no indulgence to their failings but the good old king speaks here impartially of his son fairly balancing his merits with his blames and weighing them with the charity that heaven itself will do hereafter  the king duke of clarence and warwick king thomas of clarence how chance thou art not with the prince thy brother he loves thee and thou do neglect him thomas thou have a better place in his affection than all thy brothers cherish it my boy and noble offices thou may effect of mediation after i am dead between his greatness and thy other brethren therefore omit him not blunt not his love nor lose the good advantage of his grace by seeming cold or careless of his will for he is gracious if he be observed he has a tear for pity and a hand open as day for melting charity yet notwithstanding being incensed he is flint as humorous as winter and as sudden as flaws air congealed by the coldness of the night and exploded in gusts by the warmth of the morning sun congealed in the spring of day his temper therefore must be well observed chide him for faults but do it reverently when you perceive his blood inclined to mirth but being moody give him line and scope till that his passions like a whale on ground confound themselves with working learn this thomas and thou shall prove a shelter to thy friends a hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in that the united vessel of their blood mingled with venom of suggestion as forceperforce the age will pour it in shall never leak though it should work as strong as accitum or rash gunpowder  one cannot help loving such a character taking the whole together the good part of it is its nature the bad one but its youth fruits of a wild favor are the choicest when well cultivated  in part of the above speech there is a good direction given to those who have to deal with passionate or capricious persons chide him for faults etc  i should have expatiated on the unanimity of the royal family recommended here as necessary to the safety of the crown but that i could not possibly have urged any new argument on the subject stronger than the old simile of the bundle of twigs in the fable  just after the king speaks again of the prince with the same tenderness and in a most affecting manner upon hearing that he still continues to associate with his loose companions king most subject is the fattest soil to weeds and he the noble image of my youth is oread with them therefore my grief stretches itself beyond the hour of death    in answer to this melancholy prospect warwick endeavors to make an apology for the prince in a very pretty and ingenious allusion wherein is implied what happens to have too much truth in it that no one can know the world or be fit to govern in it who is not sufficiently acquainted with the base and corrupt part of mankind  warwick my gracious lord you look beyond him quite the prince but studies his companions like a strange tongue wherein to gain the language it is needful that the most immodest word be looked upon and lerned which once attained your highnss knows comes to no farther use but to be known and hated so like gross terms the prince will in the perfectness of time cast off his followers and their memory shall as a pattern or a measure live by which his grace must mete the lives of others turning past evils to advantages  to this piece of soothing flattery the king replies with as apt a simile on his part to express his diffidence in the hopeful prophecy king it is seldom when the be forsakes her comb in the dead carrion  intimating that our affections like the honeycomb however improperly placed at first will too naturally continue still to attract us even in spite of our btter reason the simile here made use of though it may appear somewhat too coarse at first thought will quickly be found to contain a very poetical beauty in it upon recollecting the episode of aristaeus at the end of the fourth georgic where the miraculous generation of bees from the putrid carcass of an ox is related by virgil and to which this image may be looked upon as an allusion  scene ix there is a reflection made here upon the unsatisfactory or perverse state of things in this life which will have double its effect as being delivered from that so much falsely envied state a throne  upon hearing that the rebels had been overthrown the king says and wherefore should these good news make me sick will fortune never come with both hands full but write her fair words still in foulest letters she either gives a stomach and no food such are the poor in health or else a feast and takes away the stomach such the rich who have abundance and enjoy it not   scene x the prince sitting by his dying father in a slumber with the crown lying by him lays open the scene and exposes to view the real or as it may more properly be expressed the private state of greatness in the following soliloquy prince why does the crown lie there upon his pillow being so troublesome a bedfellow o polished perturbation golden care that keeps the ports of slumber open wide to many a watchful night sleep with it now yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet as he whose brow with homely biggen bound snores out the watch of night o majesty when thou do pinch thy bearer thou do sit like a rich armor worn in heat of day that ss with safety by his gates of breath ther s a down feather which stirs not  did he upre that light and weighless down perie must mo  my gracious lord my father  this sleep is sound indeed this is a sleep that from the golden rigol  in i common sense here it is put for a diadem has divorced so many english kings thy due from me is tears a eavy sorrows of the blood which nature love and sil tenderness shall o my father pay thee plenteously    i have continued this speech further than was merely necessary to the purpose for which it was introduced because i am fond of exhibiting my hero in the best lights of his character  act v scene i there are some good observations made here on the powerful effects of the company we associate with over both our minds and manners and the truth is not the less serious or worthy of attention for being humorously urged or ridiculously expressed  falstaff on shallows going out if i were sawed into quantities i should make four dozen of such bdd hrmitslaves as master shallow it is a wonderful thing to see the ble coherence of his mens spirits and his  they by observing of him do bear themselves like foolish justices he by versing with them is turned into a justicelike servingman their sp are so married in conjunction with the participation of society that they stock together in consent like so many wild  if i had a suit to master shallow i would humor his men  the imputation of being near their master if to his men i  carry with master shallow that no man could better command his servants it is certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is cught as men take diseases one of another therefore let men take heed of their company i will devise matter enough out of this shallow to keep prince henry in continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions which is four terms or two actions the humor here lies in calculating the time of a spendthrift by law terms or actions for debt johnson  and he shall laugh without intervallums the vacations between the terms  o it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest with a sad sad for serious brow will do with a fellow that never had the ach in his shoulders o you shall see him laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up  scene ii the following passage though long will not be found tedious and is so full of excellent matter for observation that it would be unpardonable to shorten it the particulars worthy of notice in it are already so strongly marked by the principal speakers themselves that it would be an useless and impertinent labor in me to point them out to the reader  the prince of wales now king with the dukes of lancaster gloucester clarence and the lord chief justice  chief justice heaven save your majesty  henry this new and gorgeous garment majesty sits not so easy on me as you think brothers you mix your sadness with some fear  this is the english not the turkish court the sultan puts all his brothers to death when he mounts the throne it is said so at least  not amurath an amurath succeeds but harry harry  yet be sad good brothers for to speak truth it very well becomes ye sorrow so royally in you appears that i will deeply put the fashion on and wear it in my heart why then be sad but entertain no more of it good brothers than a joint burden laid upon us all for me by heaven i bid you be assured i will be your father and your brother too let me but bear your love i will bear your cares yet weep that harrys dead well so will i but harry lives that shall convert those tears by number into hours of happiness  the brothers we hope no other from your majesty  henry you all look strangely on me and you most who are i think assured i love you not to the chief justice  chief justice i am assured if i be measured rightly your majesty has no just cause to hate me  henry no might a prince of my great hopes forget so great indignities you laid upon me what rate rebuke and roughly send to prison the immediate heir of england was this easy may this be washed in lethe and forgotten  chief justice i then did use the person of your father the image of his power lay then in me and in the administration of his law while i was busy for the common weal your highness pleased to forget my place the majesty and power of law and justice the image of the king whom i presented and struck me in my very seat of judgment whereon as an offender to your father i gave bold sway to my authority and did commit you this is a historic fact  if the deed were ill be you contented wearing now the garland to have a son set your decrees at naught to pluck down justice from your awful bench to trip the course of law and blunt the sword that guards the peace and safety of your person nay more to spurn at your most royal image and mock your working in a second body question your royal thoughts make the case yours be now the father and propose a son hear your own dignity so much profaned see your most sacred laws so loosely slighted behold yourself so by a son disdained and then imagine me taking your part and in your power so silencing your son  after this cold considerance sentence me and as you are a king speak in your state what i have done that misbecame my place my person or my lieges sovereignty  henry you are right justice and you weigh this well  therefore still bear the balance and the sword and i do wish your honors may increase till you do live to see a son of mine offend you and obey you as i did i should choose to alter the line thus  offend not but obey you as i did  for which i do commit into your hand the unstained sword that you have used to bear with this remembrance that you use the same with a like bold just and impartial spirit as you have done against me there is my hand you shall be as a father to my youth my voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear and i will stoop and humble my intents to your wellpractised wise directions and princes all believe me i beseech ye my father is gone wild wild the sense of the word in this place is obscure and the figure of speech necessary to explain it must be extended on the rack to confess its meaning but as the best way of studying an author is to make him a comment on himself by this rule we must suppose this expression to intend that the reality of his wildness an impression of which his father carried with him to the grave is as much buried there as his idea of it is the princes wildness is spoken of in other places and is mentioned in such a manner as to support this explication into his grave for in his tomb lie my affections affections loose habits and dissipated manners  and with his spirit sadly sadly for soberly seriously or thoughtfully i survive to mock the expectations of the world to frustrate prophecies and to raze out rotten opinion which has set me down after my seeming though my tide of blood has proudly flowed in vanity till now now does it turn and ebb back to the sea where it shall mingle with the state of floods and flow henceforth in formal majesty now call we our high court of parliament and let us choose such limbs of noble counsel that the great body of our state may go in equal rank with the bestgoverned nation that war or peace or both at once may be as things acquainted and familiar to us in which you father shall have foremost hand our coronation done we will accite as i before remembered all our state and heaven consigning to my good intents no prince nor peer shall have just cause to say heaven shorten harrys happy life one day  this judges name was hankford but the favorable event here described never happened with regard to him shakespeare i suppose only introduced it by way of heightening our idea of the young king and in this light though the fact be false it may however according to the distinction of some moral writer be considered as a secondary truth because it corresponds with the character of the agent and would probably have happened had the poor man lived to have appeared before him  but alas the inconsistencies of human nature this upright judge this brave man was struck with such a panic on the demise of henry the fourth that he instantly formed a scheme for destroying himself in the following manner he gave strict orders to his park keeper to shoot any person that should attempt to pass through his grounds without giving an account of his name and business in the middle of that night he put himself in the way refused to answer and was immediately killed according to the mad scheme of his pusillanimous purpose  scene vii i shall close my remarks on this play with the following noble speech of the young king in which his truly great and amiable character is finely wound up  falstaff pistol and others falstaff my king my jove i speak to thee my heart  king i know thee not old man fall to thy prayers  how ill white hairs become a fool and jester i have long dreamed of such a kind of man so surfeitswelled so old and so profane but being awake i do despise my dream make less thy body hence and more thy grace leave gormandizing know the grave does gape for thee thrice wider than for other men reply not to me with a foolborn jest presume not that i am the thing i was for heaven does know so shall the world perceive that i have turned away my former self so will i those that kept it company when thou do hear i am as i have been approach me and thou shall be as thou wast the tutor and the feeder of my riots till then i banish thee on pain of death as i shall do the rest of my misleaders not to come near our person by ten miles for competence of life i will allow you that lack of means enforce you not to evil and as we hear you do reform yourselves we will according to your strength and qualities give you  cement  henry the fifth dramatis personae men henry the fifth king of france the dauphin duke of york uncles to henry duke of exeter uncles to henry duke of bedford brothers to henry duke of

queen of france catharine her daughter a lady of the french court henry the fifth act i scene i the sudden reformation of henry prince of wales upon his succession to the crown is a fact recorded in history and there have been sufficient instances of such an exertion of latent virtue in mankind upon record to evince its not being a thing unnatural though sad to say it not enough to prevent its being reckoned in the class of uncommon events let us but lend our own assistance and grace will seldom be found wanting this extraordinary character is most beautifully described in the example now before us  canterbury and ely discoursing about the king canterbury the courses of his youth promised it not  the breath no sooner left his fathers body but that his wildness mortified in him seemed to die too yea at that very moment consideration like an angel came and whipped the offending adam out of him leaving his body as a paradise to invelop and contain celestial spirits what a beautiful and poetical allusion is here made to the circumstance of our first parents being exiled from eden  never came reformation in a flood with such an heady current scowering faults alluding to hercules turning the course of a river through the augaean stables  nor ever hydraheaded wilfulness shakespeare having hinted at one of the labors of hercules a second immediately occurred and i should not have been surprised in the exuberance of his imagery if he had gone through the whole dozen if it was only for an opportunity of making this reflection that a reformation from vice was an harder task than them all put together  so soon did lose his seat and all at once as in this king  scene ii here follows a fine lesson for states and potentates to reflect seriously upon when they are publishing manifestos or meditating a war  the king and canterbury who was president of his council henry my learned lord we pray you to proceed and justly and religiously unfold why the law salic that they have in france or should or should not bar us in our claim and god forbid my dear and faithful lord that you should fashion wrest or bow your reading or nicely charge your understanding soul with opening titles miscreate whose right suits not in native colors with the truth for god does know how many now in health shall drop their blood in approbation in approbation in support of a cause he had pronounced to be just  of what your reverence shall incite us to therefore take heed how you impawn your person pledge your character and conscience  how you awake the sleeping sword of war we charge you in the name of god take heed for never two such kingdoms did contend without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops are every one a woe a sore complaint against him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords that make such waste in brief mortality under this conjuration speak my lord for we will hear note and believe in heart that what you speak is in your conscience washed as pure as sin with baptism    there is a just description of the nature of government given a good deal further in the same scene  canterbury and ely ely while that the armed hand does fight abroad the advised head defends itself at home for government though high and low and lower put into parts does keep in one consent congreeing in a full and natural close like music  both the distinction and the simile here made use of are almost a literal translation of a parallel passage in cicero and there are so many other allusions of the same kind to be met with throughout our authors writings as might lead one into an opinion of his being a tolerable classical scholar notwithstanding ben johnsons invidious line although thou had small latin and less greek but in denying him the accomplishment of literature he paid an higher compliment to his genius than perhaps he meant as this was to impute to him the greater merit of being possessed of the same fancy and judgment with the best of the ancients without the advantages of their example or instruction  the subject of the above speech is considered more at large and treated in detail in the deduction drawn from it in the reply  canterbury therefore heaven does divide the state of man in diverse functions setting endeavor in continual motion to which is fixed as an aim or butt obedience for so work the honeybees creatures that by a rule in nature teach the art of order to a peopled kingdom they have a king and officers of sort where some like magistrates correct at home others like merchants venture trade abroad others like soldiers armed in their stings make boot upon the summers velvet buds which pillage they with merry march bring home to the tentroyal of their emperor who busied in his majesty surveys the singing mason building roofs of gold the civil citizen kneading up the honey the poor mechanic porters crowding in their heavy burdens at his narrow gate the sadeyed justice with his surly hum delivering over to executors pale the lazy yawning drone i thus inser that many things having full reference to one consent may work contrariously as many arrows loosed several ways come to one mark as many ways meet in one town as many fresh streams meet in one salt sea as many lines close in the dials center so may a thousand actions once afoot end in one purpose and be all well borne without defeat  scene iii when the ambassadors of france come before henry they ask him whether they may speak their errand in express words or must be restrained to deliver the substance of it only in more covert terms to which he replies henry we are no tyrant but a christian king unto whose grace our passion is as subject as are our wretches fettered in our prisons therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness tell us the dauphins mind    the above speech is worth noting considering the maxim generally resentment may be excusable in a man but is unpardonable in a king in this character he is to consider himself but as one of the states of government only and legislature is dispassionate shall a judge suffer himself to be biassed by private pique when pronouncing a public sentence when power is made use of to revenge personal affronts royalty ceases and tyranny begins  act ii scene i chorus o england model to thy inward greatness like little body with a mighty heart what might thou do that honor would thee do were all thy children kind and natural  this is a reflection which cannot too frequently be made and should be the preamble to every act or deed of kings lords and commons see the speech and reflection which concludes king john in this work  scene iii if i had attended to the order of the subjects without regarding that of the scenes i should have added the following passage to the last observation on the former act and to which note i beg leave now to refer the reader  the king on sentencing the conspirators cambridge scroop and gray says god quit you in his mercy hear your sentence you have conspired against our royal person joined with an enemy proclaimed and from his coffers received the golden earnest of our death wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter his princes and his peers to servitude his subjects to oppression and contempt and his whole kingdom into desolation touching our person seek we no revenge but we our kingdoms safety must so tender whose ruin you three sought that to her laws we do deliver you go therefore hence poor miserable wretches to your death the taste whereof god of his mercy give you patience to endure and true repentance of all your dear offenses   scene v the king of france and the dauphin dauphin my most redoubted father it is most meet we arm us against the foe for peace itself should not so dull a kingdom though war and no known quarrel were in question but that defenses musters preparations should be maintained assembled and collected as were a war in expectation therefore i say it is meet we all go forth to view the sick and feeble parts of france but let us do it with no show of fear no with no more than if we heard that england were busied with a whitsun morrisdance  such ought to be the vigilance of all states  when sovereigns repose their heads supinely in the lap of peace they must expert to be taken napping at some unguarded hour or other the best way of making peace is with sword in hand they say  yes  and to preserve it too  in the continuation of this scene the same speaker adds another rule of prudence and safety to the former  dauphin in causes of defense it is best to weigh the enemy more mighty than he seems so the proportions of defense are filled which of a weak and niggardly projection does like a miser spoil his coat with scanting  and again the same subject is in some sort carried on with additional reflections  french king you see this chase is hotly followed friends  dauphin turn head and stop pursuit for coward dogs most spend their months open or ark huntsmans phrase  when what they seemed to threaten runs far before them good my sovereign take up the english short and let them know of what a monarchy you are the head selflove my liege it not so vile a sin as selfneglecting  scene vi in the speech of the english ambassador to the french king claiming the rights of henry there are some truly alarming reflections proposed to the consideration of all states that undertake or maintain a war in an unjust cause and may be considered as a supplement to henrys first speech in the former act  exeter he bids you in the bowels of the lord deliver up the crown and to take mercy on the poor souls for whom this hungry war opens his vasty jaws upon your head turning the dead mens blood the widows tears the orphans cries the pining maidens groans the text is much improved by a transposition of the images in these two lines according to a note of doctor johnsons on the passage  for husbands fathers and betrothed lovers that shall be swallowed in this controversy  act iii scene iv the same subject and reflections are repeated here before the besieged gates of harfleur  henry how yet resolves the governor of the town this is the latest parle we will admit therefore to our best mercy give yourselves or like to men proud of destruction defy us to our worst as i am a soldier a name that in my thoughts becomes me best if i begin the battery once again i will not leave the halfachieved harfleur till in her ashes the lie buried the gates of mercy shall be all shut up and the fleshed soldier rough and hard of heart in liberty of bloody hand shall range with conscience wide as hell mowing like grass your fresh fair virgins and your flowering infants what is it then to me if impious war arrayed in flames like to the prince of fiends do with his smircht complexion all fell feats enlinked to waste and desolation what is it to me when you yourselves are cause if your pure maidens fall into the hand of hot and forcing violation what rein can hold licentious wickedness when down the hill he holds his fierce career we may as bootless spend our vain command upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil as send our precepts to the leviathan to come ashore therefore ye men of harfleur take pity of your town and of your people while yet my soldiers are in my command while yet the cool and temperate wind of grace disperse disperse  the word in the text is over low the commentator finds fault with the harshness of the metaphor but leaves it so i have ventured on this alteration and have put the verb into the potential mood to preserve the meter of the line the filthy and contagious clouds of heady murder spoil and villainy if not why in a moment look to see the blind and bloody soldier with foul hand defile the locks of your shrillshrieking daughters your fathers taken by the silver beards and their most reverend heads dashed to the walls your naked infants spitted upon pikes while the mad mothers with their howls confused do break the clouds as did the wives of jewry at herods bloodyhunting slaughtermen what say ye will ye yield and this avoid or guilty in defense be thus destroyed  what an horrid representation is here given of the too general state of routed battle a civil war excited among all the wild beasts of the forest could not afford so shocking a picture no creature but man joins cruelty with fierceness or adds malice to rage none but the inhuman human savage man  the above description of a victorious enemy is too true a one if historic evidence can force reluctant credit  for war has its barbarous rights  or wrongs rather  which neither humanity can prevent nor discipline restrain nor justice punish  war is its own legislator and victory to itself a law  it is wars prize to take all vantages henry vi third part  scene viii after the surrender of harfleur when henry is on his march to calais he is met by mountjoy the french herald who delivers an insolent defiance from the king of france requiring to know what ransom he will compound to pay for leave to retire alive out of the kingdom to which he replies thou do thy office fairly turn thee back and tell thy king i do not seek him now but could be willing to march on to calais without impeachment for to say the sooth sb an old saxon word for truth  though it is no wisdom to confess so much unto an enemy of craft and vantage my people are with sickness much enfeebled my numbers lessened and those few i have almost no better than so many french who when they were in health i tell thee herald i thought upon one pair of english legs did march three frenchmen  yet forgive me god that i do brag thus this your air of france has blown that vice in me i must repent go therefore tell thy master here i am  my ransom is this frail and worthless trunk my army but a weak and sickly guard yet god before tell him we will come on though france himself and such another neighbor stand in our way there is for thy labor mountjoy go bid thy master well advise himself  if we may pass we will if we be hindered we shall your tawny ground with your red blood discolor and so mountjoy fare you well the sum of all our answer is but this we would not seek a battle as we are yet as we are we say we will not shun it  so tell your master    there is something extremely fine in henrys reply to the french gasconading taunt above it is uncommon to meet with so much carelessness and courage in the same character  there is no such description in history nor have many people probably ever been acquainted with it among the living manners of men and yet the representation of it appears to be so perfectly natural that we must greatly admire the talents of a writer who could thus realize in effect a mere idea  the bravery of henry scorned to deny the condition of his troops either with regard to their health or numbers these circumstances the enemy pretended to have been acquainted with already or were determined to make an experiment of at least he therefore openly acknowledges the truth of his weak situation and this with the same ease and humor as he would have delivered himself to falstaff had he been his aidducamp for the day upon his royal face there is no note how dread an army have enrounded him chorus to act iv  but at the same time he most resolutely declares his purpose of trying the event at every hazard of life claim and liberty  the contemptuous sarcasms he throws out in this speech against the french nation besides showing an admirable temper and composure of mind in such difficult circumstances convey also an apt repartee to the scornful insolence of the dauphin who in return to henrys demanding his right of succession to the crown of france sent him a parcel of tennisballs to play with in allusion to the slight repute of his former life and manners pertness is impertinence but repartee has the lex talionis or law of retaliation on its side  shakespeare has a great resemblance to ariosto whose style had a mixture of humor with sublimity in it the late ingenious mr hawkins says of the latter his heroes are full of merriment in the midst of danger and he seldom describes a battle without a jest  scene ii the same magnanimity of character in henry is displayed throughout this play one of the instances of it we may see in this scene out of which also some other things worthy of notice may be picked up the reader will mark them as he peruses  the english camp at agincourt henry and gloucester henry gloster it is true that we are in great danger the greater therefore should our courage be enter bedford good morrow brother bedford  god almighty there is some soul of goodness in things evil would man observingly distill it out for our bad neighbors make us early stirrers which is both healthful and good husbandry besides they are our outward consciences and preachers to us all admonishing that we should dress us fairly for our end thus may we gather honey from the weed and make a moral of the devil himself enter erpingham good morrow old sir thomas erpingham a good soft pillow for that good white head were better than a churlish turf of france  erpingham not so my liege this lodging likes me better since i may say now lie i like a king  henry it is good for men to love their present pain upon example so the spirit is eased and when the mind is quickened out of doubt the organs though defunct and dead before break up their drowsy grave and newly move with casted sough  the skin of a snake the casting of which was thought formerly to renew its vigor  and fresh legerity lend me thy cloak sir thomas brothers both commend me to the princes in our camp do my good morrow to them and anon desire them all to my pavilion  gloucester we shall my liege  erpingham shall i attend your grace  henry no my good knight go with my brothers to my lords of england i and my bosom must debate awhile and then i would no other company  erpingham the lord in heaven bless thee noble harry  henry god amercy old heart thou speak cheerfully  scene iv and again his excellent composure of mind is manifested further in this scene where he answers the challenges of the guards going their rounds but without revealing himself i shall here present the entire passage to the reader referring as in the former instance the several parts of it which deserve observation to his own apprehension  henry going out enter bates and williams two soldiers williams who goes there   henry a friend   williams under what captain serve you   henry under sir thomas erpingham   williams a good old commander and a most kind gentleman i pray you what thinks he of our estate   henry even as men wrecked upon a sand that look to be washed off the next tide   bates he has not told his thought to the king   henry no nor is it meet he should for though i speak it to you i think the king is but a man as i am  the violet smells to him as it does to me all his senses have but human conditions his ceremonies laid by in his nakedness he appears but a man and though his affections are higher mounted than ours yet when they stoop they stoop with the like wing therefore when he sees reason of fears as we do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish as ours are yet in reason no man should possess him with any appearance of fear lest he by showing it should dishearten his army   bates he may show what outward courage he will but i believe as cold a night as it is he could wish himself in the thames up to the neck and so i would he were and i by him at all adventures so we were quit here   henry by my troth i will speak my conscience of the king i think he would not with himself any where but where he is   bates then would he were here alone so should he be sure to be ransomed and many poor mens lives saved   henry i dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone however you speak this to feel other mens minds methinks i could not die any where so contented as in the kings company his cause being just and his quarrel honorable   williams that is more than we know   bates ay or more than we should seek after for we know enough if we know we are the kings subjects if his cause be wrong our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us   williams but if the cause be not good the king himself has a heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and arms and heads chopped off in a battle shall join together at the latter day and cry all we died at such a place some swearing some crying for a surgeon some upon their wives left poor behind them some upon the debts they owe some upon their children rawly left i am afeared there are few die well that fall in battle for how can they charitably dispose of any thing when blood is their argument now if these men do not die well it will be a black matter for the king that led them to it whom to disobey were against all proportion of subjection   henry so if a son that is sent by his father about merchandise do fall into some lewd action and miscarry the imputation of his wickedness by your rule should be imposed upon the father that sent him or if a servant under his masters command transporting a sum of money be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconciled iniquities you may call the business of the matter the author of the servants damnation but this is not so  the king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers the father of his son nor the master of his servant for they purpose not their deaths when they purpose their services besides there is no king be his cause never so spotless if it come to the arbitrament of swords can try it with all unspotted soldiers some peradventure have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder some of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury some making the wars their bulwark that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery now if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment though they can cutstrip men they have no wings to fly from god war is his beadle war is his vengeance so that herein men are punished for beforebreach of the kings law in the kings quarrel now  where they feared death they have borne life away and where they would be safe they perish then if they die unprovided no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for which they are now visited every subjects duty is the kings but every subjects soul is his own therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed wash every moth out of his conscience and dying so death is to him an advantage or not dying the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained and to him that escapes it were not sin to think that making god so free an offer he let him outlive that day to see his greatness and to teach others how they should prepare   williams it is certain that every man that dies ill the ill is upon his own head the king is not to answer for it     in the continuation of this scene williams quarrels with the king still unknown and they exchange gages with each other to fight on their next interview henry does all this in sport and i should not have brought it forward to the readers view but that this particular is alluded to just now in the sixteenth scene of this act  scene v the following beautiful speech is replete with fine reflection rich language and poetical imagery it immediately follows the above dialogue when the soldiers quit the scene and is a meditation naturally arising from the argument there discussed henry solus upon the king let us our lives our souls our debts our careful wives our children and our sins lay on the king he must bear all o hard condition and twinborn with greatness subject to breath of every fool whose sense no more can feel but his own wringing what infinite heartease must kings neglect that private men enjoy and what have kings that private have not too save ceremony save general ceremony and what art thou thou idol ceremony what kind of god art thou that suffer more of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers what are thy rents what are thy comings in o ceremony show me but thy worth what is thy soul o adoration art thou aught else but place degree and form creating awe and fear in other men wherein thou art less happy being feared than they in fearing what drinkst thou often instead of homage sweet but poisoned flattery o be sick great greatness and bid thy ceremony give thee cure think thou the fiery fever will go out with titles blown from adulation will it give place to flexure and low bending can thou wnen thou commandst the beggars knee command the health of it no thou proud dream that playest so subtly with a kings repose i am a king that find thee and i know it is not the balm the scepter and the ball the sword the mace the crown imperial the entretissued robe of gold and pearl the farsed farsed signifies puffed or tumid title running before the king the throne he sits on nor the tide of pomp that beats upon the high shore of this world no not all these thricegorgeous ceremonies nor all these laid in bed majestical can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave who with a body filled and vacant mind gets him to rest crammed with distressful bread never sees horrid night the child of hell but like a lacquey from the rise to set sweats in the eye of phoebus and all night sleeps in elysium next day after dawn does rise and help hyperion the morning star to his horse and follows so the everrunning year with profitable labor to his grave and but for ceremony such a wretch winding up days with toil and nights with sleep has the forehand and vantage of a king the slave a member of the countrys peace enjoys it but in gross brain little wots what watch the king keeps to maintain the peace whose hours the peasant best advantages   what is indeed the superior state of kings but greater pomp anxiety and danger  scene vi henry makes a good prayer here just before the engagement in the first part of which is expressed a proper theological sense in the referring all events to the disposition of providence but in the latter end of it the popish doctrine of commutation the making atonement for misdeeds by pious acts without performing the justice of retribution is fully set forth henry o god of battles steel my soldiers hearts possess them not with fear take from them now the sense of reckoning lest the opposed numbers pluck their hearts from them  not to day o lord o not to day think not upon the fault my father made in compassing the crown i richards body have interred new and on it have bestowed more contrite tears than from it issued forced drops of blood five hundred poor i have in yearly pay who twice a day their withered hands hold up toward heaven to pardon blood and i have built two chauntries where the sad and solemn priests sing still for richards soul more will i do though all that i can do is nothing worth since that my penitence comes after all imploring pardon    scene vii the brisk presumptuous and gasconading spirit of the french nation is well exposed in the following scene laid in their camp just before the action  the dauphin duke of orleans rambures etc orleans the sun does gild our armor up my lords  dauphin montez cheval  my horse valet lacquey ha  orleans o brave spirit enter constable now my lord constable  constable hark how our steeds for present service neigh  dauphin mount them and make incision in their sides that their hot blood may spin in english eyes and daunt them with superfluous courage ha  rambures what will you have them weep our horses bloo how shall we then behold their natural tears enter a messenger messenger the english are embattled you french peers  constable to horse ye gallant princes strait to horse do but behold yon poor and starved band and your fair show shall suck away their souls leaving them but the shales shale corrupt english for shell and husks of men there is not work enough for all our hands scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins to give each naked curtleax a stain that our french gallants shall today draw out and sheath for lack of sport let us but blow on them the vapor of our valor will oerturn them it is positive against all exception lords that our superfluous lacqueys and our peasants who in unnecessary action swarm about our squares of battle were enough to purge this field of such a hilding hilding mean or contemptible foe though we upon this mountains basis by took stand for idle contemplation but that our honors must not what is to say a very little little let us do and all is done then let the trumpet sound the tucketsonance and the note to mount for our approach shall so much dare the field that england shall couch down in fear and yield the words marked in italics in these three last lines are borrowed from the sporting phrase particularly falconry to express a scorn of the english forces   enter grandpree grandpree why do ye stay so long my lords of france yon island carrions desperate of their bones illfavouredly become the morning field their ragged curtains poorly are let loose and our air shakes them passing scornfully big mars seems bankrupt in their beggared host and faintly through a rusty bever peeps the horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks with torchstaves in their hands and their poor jades lob down their heads dropping the hide and hips the gum downroping from their pale dead eyes and in their pale dull mouths the gimmalbit a curb bridle  lies foul with chewed grass still and motionless and their executors the knavish crows fly over them all impatient for their hour description cannot suit itself in words to demonstrate the life of such a battle in life so liveless as it shows itself  constable they have said their prayers and they wait for death  dauphin shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits and give their fasting horses provender and after fight them  grandprees description given here of a fatigued dispirited and weatherbeaten host is most masterly drawn in the true picturesque style in the above passage and if the french had fought on that memorable day but as well as shakespeare has made them speak upon the occasion england might not perhaps have numbered france among the titles of its crown  scene viii the gallant spirit of a soldier is nobly set forth in this scene which were it founded merely in the imagination of the poet would not be so material to be remarked upon but being grounded on historic fact ought to be taken notice of for the honor of our english hero  henry and westmorland westmorland o that we now had here but one ten thousand of those men in england that do no work today the battle of agincourt was fought on st crispians day a great festival then observed in england   king what is he that wishes so my cousin westmorland no my fair cousin if we are marked to die we are enough to do our country loss and if to live the fewer men the greater share of honor gods will i pray thee wish not one man more by jove i am not covetous of gold nor care i who does feed upon my cost it yerns me not if men my garments wear such outward things dwell not in my desires but if it be a sin to covet honor i am the most offending soul alive no faith my lord wish not a man from england  gods peace i would not lose so great an honor as one man more methinks would share from me for the best hopes i have dont wish one more rather proclaim it westmorland through my host that he who has no stomach to this fight let him depart his passport shall be made and crowns for convoy put into his purse we would not die in that mans company that fears his fellowship to die with us this day is called the feast of crispian  he that outlives this day and comes safe home will stand a tiptoe when this day is named and rouse him at the name of crispian he that shall live this day and see old age will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbors and say tomorrow is saint crispian then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars old men forget yet shall not all forget but they will remember with advantages with advatages magnifying their own prowess  what feats they did that day then shall our names familiar in their mouths as household words harry the king bedford and exeter warwick and talbot salisbury and gloster shakespeare seems to have made the king purposely leave the name of westmorland out of this illustrious roll from a pique at his having wished for additional forces or more probably to preserve the chastity of historic enumeration as he had not distinguished himself in the action  be in their flowing cups freshly remembered this story shall the good man teach his son and crispin crispian shall never go by from this day to the ending of the world but we in it shall be remembered we few we happy few we band of brothers for he today that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother be he never so vile this day shall gentle his condition and gentlemen in england now abed shall think themselves accursed they were not here and hold their manhoods cheap while any speaks that fought with us upon saint crispians day  the latter part of this speech though somewhat too declamatory contains many of those reflections and considerations which used formerly to inspire our troops with courage while that virtuous and noble spirit was yet retained among our brave ancestors which led them to respect what their country or posterity might think or say of them  scene ix the tenor of henrys character is still finely preserved in the following passage which as his cause was just and that his magnanimity and resolution so happily bore him through the infinite odds of opposition deserves well to be observed upon  when the two armies are just on the point of joining battle the french herald comes again to the english camp repeating the same challenge as before from the constable requiring to know what terms the king would propose for his ransom as supposing him already a captive  henry i pray thee bear my former answer back bid them achieve me and then sell my bones good god why should they mock poor fellows thus the man that once did sell the lions skin while the beast lived was killed with hunting him and many of our bodies shall no doubt find native graves upon the which i trust shall witness live in brass of this days work let me speak proudly tell the constable we are but warriors for the working day we have no holiday change of apparel to put on we are men about our business  our gayness and our gilt are all besmirched with rainy marching in the painful field there is not a piece of feather a soldiers plume in our host  good argument i hope we will not fly and time has worn us into slovenry but by the mass our hearts are in the trim and my poor soldiers tell me yet ere night they will be in fresher robes or they will pluck the gay new coats over the french soldiers heads and turn them out of service if they do as if god please they shall my ransom then will soon be levied  herald save thy labor come thou no more for ransom gentle herald they shall have none i swear but these my joints which if they have as i will leave em them shall yield them little  tell the constable  scene xii here follows a noble example of bravery friendship loyalty and composure of mind  in fine of every manly excellence and virtue most beautifully described in the recital of one short and single action on the field of battle  henry and exeter henry well have we done thrice valiant countrymen but all is not done the french yet keep the field  exeter the duke of york commends him to your majesty  henry lives he good uncle thrice within this hour i saw him down thrice up again and fighting from helmet to the spur all bleeding over  exeter in which array brave soldier does he lie larding the plain and by his bloody side yoke fellow to his honourowing wounds the noble earl of suffolk also lies suffolk first died and york all haggled over comes to him where in gore he lay insteeped and takes him by the beard kisses the gashes that bloodily did yawn upon his face and cries aloud tarry my cousin suffolk my soul shall thine keep company to heaven  tarry sweet soul for mine then fly abreast as in this glorious and wellfoughten field we kept together in our chivalry upon these words i came and cheered him up he smiled me in the face gave me his hand and with a feeble gripe says dear my lord commend my service to my sovereign so did he turn and over suffolks neck he threw his wounded arm and kissed his lips and so espoused to death with blood he sealed a testament of noble ending love the pretty and sweet manner of it forced those waters from me which i would have stopped but i had not so much of man in me but all my mother came into my eyes and gave me up to tears  henry i blame you not for hearing this i must perforce compound with mistful eyes or they will issue too  an alarm but hark what new alarm is this same  the poet has most judiciously interrupted henrys speech in this critical place it would have been expected from him to have said something more upon so interesting an occasion and yet it would have been impossible to have carried either sentiment or expression higher than exeter had just done on the same subject shakespeare has herein imitated the address of timanthes who in his picture of the sacrifice of iphigenia covers her fathers head with a veil  scene xiv henry i was not angry since i came to france until this instant take a trumpet herald ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill if they will fight with us bid them come down or void the field they do offend our sight if they will do neither we will come to them and make them sker away as swift as stones enforced from the old assyrian slings  the first sentence in the above speech is one among the many instances in which shakespeare has manifested his thorough knowledge in human nature henry acts with an heroic resolution during the whole of this perilous conflict and replies with a daring and careless spirit to all the insolence and contempt of a powerful enemy but he expresses no rage nor betrays the least manner of resentment throughout the dangers and difficulties of his situation required the utmost command and preservation of his temper distress and affliction are sovereign specifics for the pride and fierceness of mans nature but these restraints being now removed by his victory he begins to yield the rein a little to passion upon seeing the obstinacy of the enemy still continuing after their defeat  scene xvi here the passage hinted above from the latter part of the fourth scene in this act comes to be cleared up when the soldier finds that the unknown person he had engaged to fight with was his king upon this occasion he makes an apology for himself which may have its use in being extended to a general reflection applicable to all the superior ranks of life that those who demean themselves below their character or dignity can have no right to challenge that respect from the world which they might otherwise be entitled to  henry and the soldier henry how can thou make me satisfaction   soldier all offenses my lord come from the heart never came any from mine that might offend your majesty   henry it was ourself thou did abuse   soldier your majesty came not like yourself you appeared to me but as a common man witness the night your garments your lowliness and what your highness suffered under that shape i beseech you take it for your fault and not mine for had you been as i took you for i made no offense therefore i beseech your highness pardon me   scene xvii henry preserves the same spirit of piety after his victory as he had expressed just before the action in scene the sixth of this act in imputing his success to the arm and protection of omnipotence alone  henry exeter and fluellin henry o god thy arm was here and not to us but to thy arm alone ascribe we all when without stratagem but in plain shock and even play of battle was ever known so great and little loss on one part and on the other take it god for it is only thine  exeter it is wonderful  henry come go we in procession to the village and be it death proclaimed through our host to boast of this or take that praise from god which is his only  fluellin is it not lawful an please your majesty to tell how many are killed  henry yes captain but with this acknowledgment that god fought for us  act v scene iii in this scene a congress is held between the english and french which is opened by the duke of burgundy with a declamatory representation of a country during a state of war which moves me more even than the description of a battle would do the barbarous scene here set forth is more general and permanent  the latter passage which mentions the condition of uneducated youth is by much the most affecting part of the picture the former damage by labor money and a good harvest may be repaired but neither industry mines nor less than an age can retrieve the other loss  burgundy since then my office has so far prevailed that face to face aad royal eye to eye you have congreeted let it not disgrace me if i demand before this royal view what rub or what impediment there is why that the naked poor and mangled peace dear nurse of arts plenties and joyful births should not in this best garden of the world our fertile france put up her lovely visage alas she has from france too long been chased and all her husbandry does lie on heaps corrupting in its own fertility her vine the merry chearer of the heart unpruned dies her hedges even pleached like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair put forth disordered twigs her fallow leas leas enclosed grounds  the darnel hemlock and rank fumitory does root upon while that the coulter rusts that should deracinate such savagery the even mead that erst brought sweetly forth the freckled cowslip burnet and green clover wanting the scythe all uncorrected rank conceives by idleness and nothing teems but hateful docks rough thistles kecksies burs losing both beauty and utility and all our vineyards fallows meads and hedges defective in their nurtures grow to wildness even so our houses and ourselves our children have lost or do not learn for want of time the sciences that should become our country but grow like savages as soldiers will that nothing do but meditate on blood to swearing and stern looks diffused difused for  attire and every thing that seems unnatural  when a council is selected to retire apart and confer upon the preliminaries of peace the queen of france who is present at the treaty is asked by henry whether she chooses to go with the plenipotentiaries or would stay where she is  isabel our gracious brother i will go with them happily a womans voice may do some good when articles too nicely urged be stood on  what isabel says upon this occasion is very true men may be sometimes too sturdy with one another even in matters of mere punctilio or of trifling concern each too proud or obstinate to recede when the interposition of a woman may remove the difficulty or compose the ferment without either of the parties appearing to give up to the other  the interfering of a woman in disputes between men is seldom an indifferent matter it generally renders them either more gentle or more refractory  scene iv shakespeare appears to be so fond of the personage of henry that though he has already raised him to the highest pitch in our admiration and esteem he continues to recommend him to us still further by introducing him in a new character and situation that of a lover and a courtier he did the same for falstaff before in the merry wives of windsor at the request of queen elizabeth but here he enters a volunteer in the service had any other writer ventured on such an attempt he would have rendered him a quite different man from himself as racine has misrepresented achilles but henry continues to be the same person still only appearing in new circumstances the same humor playful spirit and careless ease remain in his courtship as may be seen in his rallying of falstaff replying to mountjoy or exchanging gages with the soldier  it is necessary to transcribe the entire dialogue between him and his mistress to support my observation as well as for the entertainment of my reader  henry catharine and a french lady henry fair catharine most fair will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms such as will enter at a ladys ear and plead his lovesuit to her gentle heart  catharine your majesty shall mock at me i cannot speak your england   henry o fair catharine if you will love me soundly with your french heart i will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your english tongue do you like me kate   catharine pardonnez moy i cannot tell what is like me   henry an angel is like you kate and you are like an angel   catharine que dit il que je suis semblable a les anges   lady oui vrayment sauve votre grace ainsi dit il   henry i said so dear catharine and i must not blush to affirm it   catharine o bon dieu les langues des hommes sont pleines de tromperies   henry what says she fair one that tongues of men are full of deceit   lady ouy dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits dat is de princess   henry the princess is the better english woman in faith kate my wooing is fit for thy understanding i am glad thou can speak no better english for if thou could thou would findst me such a plain king that thou would think i had sold my farm to buy a crown i know no ways to mince it in love but directly to say i love you then if you urge further than to say do you in faith i wear out my suit give me your answer in faith do and so clap hands and a bargain how say you lady   catharine sauf votre honneur me understand well   henry marry if you put me to verses or to dance for your sake kate why you undid me for the one i have neither words nor measure and for the other i have as little address if i could win a lady at leapfrog or by volting volting for vaulting i have taken the liberty of spelling the word so to distinguish it from the builders term according to an observation i have made on it in another place to voit comes from voltiger to fly and it is not pedantry to stick closely to an etymology when a deviation from it confounds the sense see series of letters vol vi page    into my saddle with my armor on my back under the correction of bragging be it spoken i should quickly leap into matrimony or if i might buffet for my love or bound my horse for her favors i could lay on like a butcher and sit like a jackanapes a monkey never off but before god kate i cannot look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence nor have i cunning in protestation only downright oaths which i never use till urged and never break for urging this passage was so clear to all the comentators i suppose that they have not given us any note upon it but i think it needs explanation the sense of it i take to be this i never swear except when urged by passion but the oath once  i never urge the rashness of it as an excuse for its breach  if thou can love a fellow of this temper kate whose face is not worth sunburning that never looks in his glass for love of any thing he sees there let thine eye be thy cook i speak plain soldier if thou can love me for this take me if not to say to thee that i shall die it is true but or thy love by the lord no yet i love thee too and while thou live kate take a fellow of plain and uncoined by this epithet the poet means to compare sincerity to bulliongold before it is alloyed for coinage the editors differ about the word but shakespeare explains it in this sense before he finishes the sentence  because he has not the gift to woe in other places  or gold is not so current as when turned into specie constancy for he perforce must do thee right because he has not the gift to woo in other places for those fellows of infinite tongue that can rhyme themselves into ladies favors they do always reason themselves out again reason themselves out again the finding success so easy tempts them to pursue in  conquests forsaking their former  what a speaker is but a prater a rhyme is but a ballad a good leg will fall a straight back will stoop a black beard will turn white a curled pate will grow bald a fair face will wither a full eye will wax hollow but a good heart kate is the sun and the moon or rather the sun and not the moon for it shines bright and never changes but keeps his course truly if thou would have such a one take me take a soldier take a king and what say thou then to my love speak my fair and fairly i pray thee   catharine is it possible dat i should love de enemy of france   henry no it is not possible that you should love the enemy of france kate but in loving me you should love the friend of france for i love france so well that i will not part with a village of it i will have it all mine and kate when france is mine and i am yours then yours is france and you are mine   catharine i cannot tell vat is dat   henry no kate i will tell thee in french which i am sure will hang upon my tongue like a bride about her husbands neck hardly to be shook off  quand jay le le for la henry is made to speak false french throughout to humor kates false english possession de france and quand vous avez le possession de moi  let me see  what then st dennis be my speed  donc votre est france and vous etes mienne it is as easy for me kate to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more french i shall never move thee in french unless it be to laugh at me   catharine sauf votre honneur le francois que vous parlez est meilleur que langlois lequel je parle   henry no faith it is not kate but thy speaking of my tongue and i thine most truly falsely must needs be granted to be much at one but kate do thou understand so much english can thou love me   catharine i cannot tell   henry can any of your neighbors tell kate i will ask them come i know thou love me and at night when you come into your closet you will question this gentlewoman about me and i know kate you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you like best but good kate mock me mercifully the rather gentle princess because i love thee cruelly if ever thou be mine kate as i have saving faith within me tells me thou shall i get thee with scambling scambling riotously  alluding to the war which was the prelude to his courtship  and thou must therefore needs prove a good soldierbreeder  shall not thou and i between st dennis and st george compound a boy half french half english that shall go to constantinople and take the turk by the beard shall we not what say thou my fair flowerdeluce   catharine i do not know dat   henry no it is hereafter to know but now to promise do but now promise kate you will endeavor for your french part of such a boy and for my english moiety take the word of a king and a bachelor how answer you le plus belle catharine du monde mon tres chere and divine deesse   catharine your majestee ave fause french enough to deceive de most sage damoisel i have spelt the word as i found it in the text dat is en france   henry now fie upon my false french by mine honor in true english i love thee kate by which honor i dare not swear thou love me yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou do notwithstanding the poor and untempting effect of my visage now beshrew my fathers ambition he was thinking of civil wars when he got me therefore was i created with a stubborn outside with an aspect of iron that when i come to woo ladies i fright them but in faith kate the elder i wax the better i shall appear my comfort is that old age that ill layer up of beauty can do no more spoil upon my face thou have me if thou have me at the worst and thou shall wear me if thou wear me better and better and therefore tell me most fair catharine will you have me put off your maiden blushes avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress take me by the hand and say harry of england i am thine which word thou shall no sooner bless mine ear withal but i will tell thee aloud england is thine ireland is thine france is thine and henry plantagenet is thine who though i speak it before his face if he be not fellow with the best king thou shall find the best king of good fellows come your answer in broken music for thy voice is music and thy english broken  therefore queen of all catharine break thy mind to me in broken english will thou have me   catharine dat is as it shall please le roy mon pere   henry nay it will please him well kate  it shall please him kate   catharine den it shall also content me   henry upon that i kiss your hand and call you my queen   catharine laissez mon seigneur laissez laissez  ma foy je ne veux point que vous abaissiez vostre grandeur en baisant la main de votre indgne serviteure there is no such modern french word in the feminine gender  excusez moy je vous supply mon tres puissant seigneur   henry then i will kiss your lips kate   catharine les dames and demoiselles ne faut pas etre baises devant leur nopces  il nest pas la coutume de france   heny madam my interpreter what says she   lady dat it is not be de fashon pour les ladies of france  i cannot tell what is baiser en english   henry to kiss mademoiselle   lady your majesty entendre better que moy   henry it is not a fashion for the maids of france to kiss before they are married would she say   lady ouy vrayement   henry o kate nice customs curtsie to great folks dear kate you and i cannot be confined within the weak list of a countrys fashion  we are the makers of manners kate and the liberty the privileges or authority of superior rank that follows our places stops the mouth of all findfaults as i will do yours for the upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss  therefore  patiently and yielding  kissing her you have witchcraft in your lips kate there is more eloquence in a touch of them than in all the tongues of the french council and they would sooner persuade harry of england than a general petition of monarchs here comes your father   in the last passage of the foregoing dialogue henry affords a good subject for reflection where he speaks of the powerful influence of kings over the manners of a people the maxim appears to be plausible but is not true in every respect rank and example alone will not be sufficient for this effect unsupported by dignity and precept it is not enough for a prince to act well himself and intend well to morals  he must form a purpose for their support and be active in his general as well as private capacity a sovereign indeed has it in his power whenever it is in his will most effectually to encourage virtue and discourage vice if he chooses to make this object the rule of his polity this would be the surest and safest method of rendering himself absolute for as poor cardinal wolsey says  upon a maxim too late discovered  corruption wins not more than honesty religion itself has judged it necessary to hold out distant rewards and punishments to allure and deter mankind and kings can only have a right to be styled the vicegerents of heaven when they render these sanctions more immediate a king is said to have long hands but they are of no use except to wrap himself up while he keeps them folded  lewis the fourteenth happily brought such a golden age to bear toward the latter part of his illustrious reign if we may give credit to what st evremond says in a letter of his to ninon de lenclos  you live in a country where people have extraordinary advantages toward saving their souls there vice is almost as much against the fashion as against virtue sinning passes for illbreeding shocks decency and offends good manners as much as religion formerly it sufficed to be wicked but at present one must be a scoundrel to be damned in france they who have not regard enough for another life are led to salvation by the consideration and duties of this  in order to leave the impression of this most interesting and moral reflection more strongly on the minds of the great the powerful and the opulent i shall here conclude my observations on this piece so fruitful of example and document throughout  henry the sixth first part  dramatis personae men henry the sixth duke of gloucester protector and uncle to the king bishop of winchester cardinal and great uncle to the king richard plantagenet afterward duke of york duke of somerset duke of alanson a french peer mortimer earl of march earl of warwick earl of suffolk lord talbot women  none are brought upon the scene throughout the few remarks i have had any opportunity of making on this play  henry the sixth first part act i scene i winchester speaking of the death of henry the fifth he was a king blessed of the king of kings unto the french the dreadful judgment day so dreadful will not be as was his sight the battles of the lord of hosts he fought  the churchs prayers made him so prosperous   we may remember in the former play that henry the fifth like a true christian hero imputes all his successes immediately to heaven but the good bishop i am sorry to say it like a true priest of those days here interposes between them and attributes his prosperity solely to the mediation of the church  scene v there is a good description given of the common english in the following speech alanson they want their porridge and their fat bullbeeves either they must be dieted like mules and have their provender tied to their mouths or piteous they will look like drowned mice    a true physical knowledge is here expressed a great part of personal courage depends upon the animal spirits and to keep men stout you must keep them strong if philosophy should be so difficult as to deny that good feeding can render a soldiery more brave it must admit however that it will render it more serviceable at least which is all that we mean to contend for here  act ii scene v the partiality which we are all apt to manifest toward our own interests is well noted in this place this principle is so powerful in human nature that it not only engages our affections but warps our judgments also so that it often imposes on our reason and frequently makes us continue obstinate more from error than selfishness our opinions differ even in matters of no concernment to us and how much less is it to be expected that we should be of accord when we are become a party in the question ourselves  somerset and plantagenet being engaged in a warm dispute appeal to the umpirage of a third indifferent person with all the seeming candor imaginable  somerset judge you my lord of warwick then between us  warwick between two hawks which flies the higher pitch between two dogs which has the deeper mouth between two blades which bears the better temper between two horses which does bear him best between two girls which has the merriest eye i have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgment but in these nice sharp quillets of the law good faith i am no wiser than a daw  plantagenet tut tut here is a mannerly forbearance the truth appears so naked on my side that any purblind eye may find it out  somerset and on my side it is so well apparelled so clear so shining and so evident that it will glimmer through a blind mans eye  scene vi there is something extremely moving in the first part of this scene which shows a prison from whence old earl mortimer is brought forth in a chair before the gates attended by his gaolers he had been unfortunately declared heir to the crown by richard the second and was therefore kept a prisoner of state during the reigns of henrys the fourth and fifth and continued still in confinement under the present king also  we are naturally more affected at the distresses of age infancy or women than with what we see suffered by the adult or robust unfortunate our compassion rises in proportion to the weakness of the victim as we become sensible of the inability of resistance along with the weight of the oppression  the earnest desire which the unhappy old man expresses here for the relief of death is very natural to a person in his circumstances and can by no means be deemed reprehensible in such a situation when the completion of the wish is not forwarded by any act of violence or impatience in the sufferer  mortimer kind keepers of my weak decaying age let dying mortimer here rest himself  even like a wretch new haled from the rack so fare my limbs with long imprisonment and these gray locks the pursuivants of death nestorlike aged in an age of care argue the end of hapless mortimer these eyes like lamps whose wasting oil is spent wax dim as drawing to their exigent exigent  end we meet with the word no where in this sense but here  weak shoulders overborn with burdening grief and pithless arms like to a withered vine that drops his sapless branches to the ground yet are these feet whose strengthless stay is numb unable to support this lump of clay swiftwinged with desire to get a grave as witting i no other comfort have  the first expression above of kind keepers is most tenderly affecting  a noble and a gallant mind is here represented as being so subdued by the hardness of its condition as to be reduced to the mortifying necessity of soothing and temporizing with the vile ministers of cruelty and oppression a sad object this indeed  act iv scene i here is given a description of the qualifications which had entitled the first knights of the garter to that honorable mark of distinction upon the original institution of the order a respect to which has been ever since so minutely attended to that the same dresses badges and vows of chivalry have been still preserved free from all violation the character likewise we are surely to suppose has been as critically regarded  talbot to the king and princes upon an arraignment of sir john fastolfe this is not our quondam merry knight though the near resemblance of the names and pusillanimity of the characters might possibly render the person equivocal to the reader  knight of the garter for cowardice when first this order was ordained my lords knights of the garter were of noble birth valiant and virtuous full of haughty courage such as were grown to credit by the wars not fearing death nor shrinking for distress but always resolute in most extremes he then that is not furnished in this sort does but usurp the sacred name of knight profaning this most honorable order and should if i were worthy to be judge be quite degraded like a hedgeborn swain that does presume to boast of gentle blood   act v scene ii the following reflection has too often been made both before and since the era here pointed out it is shocking to humanity as well as to religion to think that there should ever have been and should still continue such frequent occasions to repeat it  king i always thought it was both impious and unnatural that such immanity and bloody strife should reign among professors of one faith  in the same scene when the king is urged to think of marrying he very properly objects to the proposal both on account of his youth and the necessity of applying his mind to the studies becoming his rank and situation  king marriage alas my years are yet too young and fitter is my study and my books than wanton dalliance with a paramour  such considerations it seems were regarded in those days and in the time of our author likewise or he would not have commented on the subject are we grown wiser  scene viii this same topic of matrimony is fully discussed and in a more general and liberal manner in the present scene upon exeters objecting to the match proposed on account of the princess mentioned not being sufficiently endowed with fortune  suffolk a dower my lords disgrace not so your king that he should be so abject base and poor to choose for wealth and not for perfect love henry is able to enrich his queen and need not seek a queen to make him rich so worthless peasants bargain for their wives as marketmen for oxen sheep or horse but marriage is a matter of more worth than to be dealt in by attorneyship not whom we will but whom his grace affects must be companion of his nuptial bed and therefore lords since he affects her most it most of all these reasons binds us in our opinions she should be preferred for what is wedlock forced but a hell an age of discord and continual strife whereas the contrary brings forth bliss and is a pattern of celestial peace  these arguments are certainly conclusive in private life and if reasons of state may be allowed to stand against them in the supremest rank i shall only conclude my remarks on this piece with a line of an old song in favor of our natural and chartered liberties if so happys a miller then whod be a king  henry the sixth second part  dramatis personae men henry the sixth duke of gloucester uncle to the king cardinal beaufort bishop of winchester great uncle to the king duke of buckingham duke of somerset earl of salisbury earl of warwick women  none appear in any of the scenes here noted  henry the sixth second part act ii scene i the king and gloucester returned from hawking king but what a point my lord your faulcon made and what a pitch she flew above the rest  to see how god in all his creatures works yea man and birds are fain of climbing high    here the king has made a philosophic reflection on the aspiring but commendable nature of man which is improved with a religious sense in the reply gloucester my lord it is but a base ignoble mind that mounts no higher than a bird can soar this passage seems to be an imitation of a latin sentence i have somewhere met with and venture to quote from memory only  spes aquilas supervola hope soars beyond an eagles flight  i do not mean to adduce this instance in order to support an opinion of shakespeares learning but merely to show that good wits may sometimes fly as well as jump together the severest critic may surely pardon a play on words in a comment upon so sportive an author it would be an invidious reflection on our poets fame to suppose him to have been a scholar a genius lends thoughts a scholar but borrows them       scene iii when a charge has been exhibited against the duchess of gloucester for treason and sorcery the cardinal a declared enemy to the duke her husband takes occasion to insult him upon this misfortune to which he thus answers gloucester ambitious churchman leave to afflict my heart sorrow and grief have vanquished all my powers and vanquished as i am i yield to thee or to the meanest groom    the above is one of shakespeares just delineations of human nature that spirit which could not be subdued by any personal difficulty or danger becomes suddenly abated on the mortification arising from the shame and vice of one so nearly and dearly allied to him  i have been much obliged throughout this work to the commentators for not having noted many such passages as this they have rarely touched upon our authors anatomy of human nature contenting themselves like sculptors or painters with only marking its outward form its colors and proportions the veins arteries and finer capillaries of the inward man remaining often undissected  scene vii here the good duke upon the occasion of his wifes ignominy and penance makes a reflection on the general nature of human life which he illustrates with an apt allusion gloucester thus sometimes has the brightest day a cloud and after summer evermore succeeds the barren winter with his nipping cold so cares and joys abound as seasons fleet    just after this he speaks of the unhappy woman with a moving tenderness and concludes his speech with a description frequently given by shakespeare of the base nature of the whiffling multitude unneath unneath hardly or scarcely a saxon or norman adverb may she endure the flinty streets to tread them with her tender feeling feet  sweet nell ill can thy noble mind abrook the abject people gazing on thy face with envious looks still laughing at thy shame that erst did follow thy proud chariot wheels when thou did ride in triumph through the streets   act iii scene vii the following passage needs no comment  king what stronger breast plate than a heart untainted thrice is he armed that has his quarrel just and he but naked though locked up in steel whose conscience with injustice is corrupted  scene x this whole scene is so justly commended by all the critics that i shall give it to the reader entire  the king salisbury and warwick standing by the cardinal on his sickbed  king how fares my lord speak beaufort to thy sovereign  cardinal raving if thou be death i will give thee englands treasure enough to purchase such another island so thou will let me live and feel no pain  king ah what a sign it is of evil life where deaths approach is seen so terrible  warwick beaufort it is thy sovereign speaks to thee  cardinal bring me unto my trial when you will died he not in his bed raving of humphrey whom he had caused to be murdered  where should he die can i make men live whether they will or no oh torture me no more i will confess  alive again then show me where he is i will give a thousand pounds to look upon him  he has no eyes the dust has blinded them  comb down his hair  look look it stands upright like limetwigs set to catch my winged soul  give me some drink and bid the apothecary bring the strong poison that i bought of him  king o thou eternal mover of the heavens look with a gentle eye upon this wretch o beat away the busy meddling fiend that lays strong siege upon this wretchs soul and from his bosom purge this black despair  warwick see how the pangs of death do make him writhe  salisbury disturb him not  let him pass peaceably  king peace to his soul if gods good pleasure be  lord cardinal if thou think on heavens bliss hold up thy hand make signal of thy hope  he dies and makes no sign  o god forgive him  warwick so bad a death argues a monstrous life  king forbear to judge for we are sinners all close up his eyes and draw the curtain close and let us all to meditation  the above scene closes very properly with a truly christian sentiment by the king who is all through represented by shakespeare as a religious moral domestic easytempered man famed for mildness peace and prayer third part  just such a prince whose very goodness for want of sense and spirit must ever render the dupe of ministers and the sport of faction  no document no example are so effectual a warning to the mind as the view of a wicked person in his last moments this speaks to the heart as well as to the understanding we then see things and actions in their true light which the false glare of gain or pleasure or the involved and complicated nature of sin are but too apt to hide from our notice vice would disgust even those that practice it if they did not use arts to conceal the vileness of it from their own view we drink liquors out of a cup which are too foul to bear a glass  he who has betrayed a friend deceived a mistress wronged the orphan or oppressed the poor must surely never have seen a penitent on his deathbed what desperate madness then must it be ever to do a deed for any advantage in life which after so short  so very short  a space of time we would give a galaxy of worlds to have undone again  this is the only way of rendering dramatic deaths profitable to the spectators all the pantomime contortions writhings and flouncings of modern representations cannot possibly produce such an effect on the audience as this single expression he dies and makes no sign  act iv scene viii king was ever king that joyed an earthly throne and could command no more content than i no sooner was i crept out of my cradle but i was made a king at nine months old yet never subject longed to be a king as i do long and wish to be a subject  shakespeare lays hold of every occasion that fairly presents itself to put his readers out of conceit with greatness and in truth the state of kings in general even the happiest of them who are undoubtedly those whose power is limited is not much to be envied their public care if they rule alone or their private hazard if they depute the helm must deny them ease the only foundation for earthly happiness or enjoyment to rest upon kings may in some sort be compared to popish idols which are worshipped and led about in pageant procession for the purpose of procuring some partial wish of the people which if not obtained however unreasonable the petition they are then scourged and laid by in disgrace  henry the sixth third part  dramatis personae men henry the sixth earl of richmond a youth afterward henry the seventh lord rivers brother to the lady gray wife to edward duke of york afterward edward the fourth lord clifford lord hastings women margaret of anjou queen to henry the sixth lady gray wife to edward duke of york afterward queen henry the sixth third part mr theobald suspects the three parts of this drama to be spurious on account of some obsolete expressions in them alderlievest unneath mailed meseemeth darraign exigent abrook etc mr theobald does not enumerate the words but i have taken this task upon me in order to give the fullest force to his criticism the ancients have left us an humane maxim that we should never speak ill of the dead i think we should carry this moral even further by doing them every justice in our power what has particularly induced me to make this remark is that doctor johnson says he can observe but two expressions of the old phraseology throughout these three plays i do not mean to make any comparison between the sense knowledge or literature of these two critics but dr johnson is alive to answer for himself and poor theobald must now speak by anothers tongue  and doctor warburton is of the same opinion from the want of spirit and effect in the composition if i was to offer an objection to the authenticity of these pieces it should be rather from their barrenness of sentiment or reflection though i think there is enough of the style and manner of shakespeare in them all to evince them to be his  act ii scene iii there is a natural instinct even stronger than that of selfpreservation implanted in all the brute creation for the safety of their young  the simplest animals manifest an art and the most pusillanimous show a courage in the defense of their progeny but this only till they become capable of taking care of themselves account for this providence upon the principle of uninspired mechanism if ye can ye unphilosophic sophisters  clifford unreasonable irrational creatures feed their young and though mans face be fearful to their eyes yet in protection of their tender ones who has not seen them even with those wings which sometimes they have used with fearful flight make war with him that climbs unto their nest offering their own lives in their youngs defense  scene vi the ease and security of the subject is finely contrasted with the anxiety and danger of the prince in one of our authors oftrepeated reflections upon this subject in a soliloquy made by the king reclining on a hillock during the warfare between the houses of york and lancaster  would i were dead if gods good will were so for what is in this world but grief and woe o god methinks it were a happier life to be no better than a homely swain to sit upon a hill as i do now to carve out dials quaintly point by point thereby to mark the minutes as they run how many make the hour throughout this speech and many other places our author uses hour as a word of two syllables full complete how many hours bring about the day how many days will finish up the year how many years a mortal man may live when this is known then to divide the time so many hours must i tend my flock so many hours must i take my rest so many hours must i contemplate so many hours must i sport myself so many days my ewes have been with young so many weeks ere the poor fools will yean so many months ere i shall sheer the fleece so minutes hours days weeks months and years past over to the end they were created would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave ah what a life were this how sweet how lovely gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade to shepherds looking on their silly sheep than does a richembroidered canopy to kings that fear their subjects treachery o yes it does  a thousandfold it does and to conclude the shepherds homely curds his cold thin drink out of his leather bottle his wonted sleep under a fresh trees shade all which secure and sweetly he enjoys is far beyond a princes delicates his viands sparkling in a golden cup his body couched on a curious bed when care mistrust and treasons wait on him act iii scene i upon the occasion of queen margaret and warwicks going to france one to solicit the aid of lewis for lancaster and the other for york poor henry makes a very natural reflection foreboding how the balance will probably incline where interest holds the scales between two supplicants whereof one has only something to ask and the other something to proffer  king my queen and son are gone to france for aid and as i hear the great commanding warwick is thither gone to crave the french kings sister to wife for edward if this news be true poor queen and son your labor is but lost for warwick is a subtle orator and lewis a prince soon won with moving words by this account then margaret may win him for she is a woman to be pitied much her sighs will make a battery in his breast her tears will pierce into a marble heart the tiger will be mild while she does mourn and nero would be tainted with remorse to hear and see her plaints her brinish tears ay but she is come to beg  warwick to give she on his left side craving aid for henry he on his right asking a wife for edward she weeps and says her henry is deposed he smiles and says his edward is installed that she poor wretch for grief can speak no more while warwick tells his title smooths the wrong infers arguments of mighty strength and in conclusion wins the king from her with promise of his sister and what else to strengthen and support king edwards place o margaret thus twill be and thou poor soul art then forsaken as thou went forlorn  in the same scene this unhappy prince who appears throughout to be more fit for a subject than a king and yet not the less fit to be the latter for this very reason replies with philosophy and virtue to the person who is going to take him prisoner and who asks him but if thou be a king where is thy crown king my crown is in my heart not on my head not decked with diamonds and indian stones not to be seen my crown is called content  a crown it is that seldom kings enjoy    in the last line we may see that shakespeare takes one of his many occasions to humble ambition and depreciate greatness he is eternally acting the part of the slave placed behind the triumphal car not indeed to show his own envy but to abate anothers pride  act iv scene i the true policy of england with regard to all foreign states is given here in a very few words with a particular hint of ministerial prudence respecting all leagues or treaties with france  hastings it is better using france than trusting her let us be backed with god and with the seas which he has given for fence impregnable and with their helps alone defend ourselves  in them and in ourselves our safety lies  scene v after the observation above made in the third scene act ii upon the fond instinct of all irrational animals for the preservation of their brood it would be unjust as well as unphilosophic too not to pay a like compliment to our own species by quoting a passage in this scene where the wife of edward the fourth marks the same kind of tenderness and attention in a becoming manner upon hearing that her husband has been made prisoner by warwick  rivers these news i must confess are full of grief yet gracious madam bear it as you may warwick may lose that now has won the day  queen till then fair hope must hinder lifes decay and i the rather wean me from despair for love of edwards offspring in my womb this is it that makes me bridle in my passion and bear with mildness my misfortunes cross ay ay for this i draw in many a tear and stop the rising of blood sucking sighs lest with my sighs or tears i blast or drown king edwards fruit true heir to englands crown  scene vii here shakespeare takes an occasion by the means of an ex post facto prophecy to pay a compliment to queen elizabeth resembling the tu marcellus eris of virgil to livia  the king to richmond laying his hand on his head come hither englands hope  if secret powers suggest but truth to my divining thoughts this pretty lad will prove our countrys bliss his looks are full of majesty his head by nature formed to wear a crown his hand to wield a scepter and himself likely in time to bless a regal throne make much of him my lords for this is he must help you more than you are hurt by me  this earl of richmond was afterward henry the seventh and united the two houses of york and lancaster in his own person he was grandfather to queen elizabeth  act iv scene vii i shall here conclude my remarks on this play with a truth which is not the less worth attending to for being spoken by a villain as this character might have but the better enabled him to ascertain the fact  gloucester suspicion always haunts the guilty mind  the thief does fear each bush an officer  richard the third dramatis personae men richard duke of gloucester afterward richard the third earl of richmond afterward henry the seventh sons to edward the fourth edward prince of wales richard duke of york marquis of dorset son to the queen of edward the fourth by her former husband lord stanley lord hastings bishop of ely brackenbury lieutenant of the tower sir james tyrrel sir richard ratcliff women queen of edward the fourth lady anne widow of the prince of wales son to henry the sixth duchess of york mother to richard the third countess of richmond mother to the earl of richmond and wife to lord stanley richard the third act i scene i every representation either of a scene or season of peace is peculiarly soothing to the human mind it is its own most natural and pleasing state but when it is contrasted with the opposite condition of tumult and war the delight rises infinitely higher there are many such descriptions as this in shakespeare and as the imbuing the mind with such contemplations must certainly have a moral tendency in it i am glad to transcribe every passage of the kind i meet with in him  richard alone now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of york edward the fourth  and all the clouds that lowered upon our house in the deep bosom of the ocean buried now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths our bruised arms hung up for monuments our stern alarums changed to merry meetings our dreadful marches to delightful measures grimvisaged war has smoothed his wrinkled front and now instead of mounting barbed steeds to fright the souls of fearful adversaries he capers nimbly in a ladys chamber to the lascivious pleasing of a lute  in the following part of the same speech our poet zealous for the honor of the human character most artfully contrives to make richards wickedness appear to arise from a resentment against the partiality of nature in having stigmatized him with so deformed a person joined to an envious jealousy toward the rest of mankind for being endowed with fairer forms and more attractive graces by this admirable address he moves us to a sort of compassion for the misfortune even while he is raising an abhorrence for the vice of the criminal  richard but i that am not shaped for sportive tricks nor made to court an amorous lookingglass  i that am rudely stamped and want loves majesty to strut before a wanton ambling nymph  i that am curtailed of this fair proportion cheated of feature by dissembling nature t wo  s here strained to express partial or malicious  deformed unfinished sent before my time into this breathing world scarce half made up and that so lamely and unfashionably that dogs bark at me as i halt by them  why i in this weak piping time of peace have no delight to pass away the time unless to spy my shadow in the sun and descant on my own deformity and therefore since i cannot prove a lover to entertain these fair wellspoken days i am determined to prove a villain and bate bate regn or scorn instead of hate which was the word in the text  the idle pleasures of these days  scene ii this long scene in which richard courts lady anne relict of the first prince of wales son to henry the sixth whom he had murdered is so well known to every one who has ever read or seen this play that i need not be at the trouble of transcribing it though i shall take the liberty of remarking on the very improbable conclusion of it  women are certainly most extremely ill used in the unnatural representation of female frailty here given but it may perhaps be some palliation of his offense to observe that this strange fable was not any invention of the poet though it must indeed be confessed that he yielded too easy a credence to a fictitious piece of history which rested upon no better authority than the same that affirmed the deformity of richard which fact has lately from a concurrence of cotemporary testimonies been rendered problematical at least by a learned and ingenious author see a tract upon this subject by the honorable horatio walpole   the conclusion of the fifth scene of act the fourth in this play where the queen widow of edward the fourth after the death of lady anne promises her daughter to this tyrant and usurper who had killed her sons is founded likewise upon the same disingenuous authority with the two former passages  scene iii lord stanley upon the queens expressing a suspicion that his wife the countess of richmond bears her some ill will makes her defense in a speech which would conduce greatly to the peace of our minds and the preserving many of our most friendly connections unbroken if properly attended to and made the rule of our conduct through life  stanley i do beseech you either not believe the envious slanders of her false accusers or if she be accused on true report bear with her weakness which i think proceeds from wayward sickness and no grounded malice  the evil report of things said to be spoken to the disadvantage of others behind their backs has so frequently been found to proceed either from the malice or mistake of eavesdroppers listeners or incendiaries that it should warn us upon such occasions to suspend our resentments against the persons charged till we find the indictment to be grounded on better evidence than those pests of society the informers intermeddlers or talebearers besides which as is above observed every reasonable allowance ought to be made for the natural frowardness and peevishness of disorder or other uneasiness of body or mind which often sets us first at variance with ourselves before it inclines us to quarrel with others infirmity does still neglect all office whereto our health is bound lear   scene v shakespeare is here again at his frequent reflections on the vanity of ambition and the cares of greatness  brackenbury sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours makes the night morning and the noontide night  princes have but their titles for their troubles troubles for glories well exchanged by doctor johnson  an outward honor for an inward toil and for unfelt imaginations they often feel a world of restless cares  so that between their titles and low name there is nothing differs but the outward fame  act ii scene ii when the queen is lamenting the death of edward the fourth the marquis of dorset her son by a former husband says to her dorset comfort dear mother god is much displeased that with unthankfulness you take his doing in common worldly things it is called ungrateful with dull unwillingness to pay a debt which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent much more to be thus opposite with heaven for for to be understood here in the sense of because it requires the royal debt it lent you    shakespeare is extremely rich in such sentiments of piety and resignation it is a vast ease to the distressed mind to communicate its griefs to the ear of a friend though he can only condole but not relieve them how infinitely higher then must the comfort rise to repose them on the bosom of our god who can not only console but compensate them christ has not taken the sins alone but the sorrows also of mankind upon himself for those who place their hope and put their trust in him he not only says thy sins are forgiven thee but adds this comfort in affliction come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give ye rest  scene iv there is a natural representation of a distempered state just preceding a revolution given in this scene  three citizens conferring together on the circumstances of the times hold the following dialogue together  first citizen come come we fear the worst all may be well   second citizen when clouds are seen wise men put on their cloaks when great leaves fall then winter is at hand when the sun sets who does not look for night untimely storms make men expect a dearth all may be well but if god sort it so it is more than we deserve or i expect  third citizen truly the hearts of men are full of fear you cannot reason almost with a man that looks not heavily and full of dread  second citizen before the days of change still is it so  by a divine instinct mens minds mistrust ensuing danger as by proof we see the waters swell before a boisterous storm  but leave it all to god  now nothing can demonstrate the investigating faculties of shakespeare more than this passage does he never lived in any times of commotion himself therefore the particular knowledge he here shows in the general nature of such a crisis must be owing more to philosophy than experience rather to his own reflection than any knowledge of history i speak with regard to the english writers only on such subjects who were all before his time most barren of observation and maxim and as to the greek and roman historiographers who were rich in both the invidious commentators of our poet have denied him any manner of acquaintance with such outlandish literati and i also though from a very different principle have joined issue with them before in this particular in a note on elys speech hen v act i scene ii  for learning gives no talents but only supplies the faculty of showing them and this he could do without any foreign assistance  act iii scene i the poor unhappy prince of wales successor to edward the fourth makes a reflection here so becoming the natural spirit of a noble mind that it must raise a regret in the reader that he was not permitted to lve and reign over a brave and a free people  when his wicked uncle richard appoints the princes residence at the tower till his coronation he asks who built that fortress and being told it was julius caesar he says that julius caesar was a famous man with what his valor did enrich his wit his wit set down to make his valor live death makes no conquest of this conqueror for still he lives in fame though not in life   scene v richard my lord of ely when i was last in holborn i saw good strawberries in your garden there i do beseech you send for some of them  ely marry and will my lord with all my heart exit ely   could any writer but shakespeare have ever thought of such a circumstance in the midst of a deep tragedy as the sending an old grave bishop on an errand for a leaf of strawberries and this in the most formal scene of the play too where the lords are met in council to settle about the day for the coronation  but could any writer but himself have attempted such a whim without setting the audience alaughing at the ridiculousness and absurdity of such an incident and yet he contrives somehow or other to hold us in awe all the while though he must be a very ingenious critic indeed who can supply any sort of reason for the introduction of such a familiar and comic stroke upon so serious an occasion and what renders the solution of this passage still more difficult is that the request is made by a person too whose mind was deeply intent on murder and usurpation at the very time  none of the editors have taken the least notice of this article and the first notion that occurred to me upon it was that perhaps richard wanted to get rid of old ely after any manner however indecent or abrupt in order to be at liberty to plot with buckingham in private for the moment the bishop goes out on his errand he says cousin of buckingham a word with you but as he did not send the rest of the council board apacking after him and adjourn them from the bed of justice to the strawberry bed but retires immediately himself with his complotter buckingham we cannot suppose this idea to have been the purpose intended by so extraordinary a motion  there is then no other way left us to resolve this text than to impute it solely to the peculiar character that shakespeare has given us all along of this extraordinary personage whom he has represented throughout as preserving a facetious humor and exerting a sort of careless ease in the midst of all his crimes  i am sorry not to be able to give a better account of this particular than what i have here offered because if it is to rest upon such a comment our author must in this instance be thought to have betrayed a manifest ignorance in human nature or the nature of guilt at least as no vicious person i do not mean those of profligate manners merely but no designing or determined villain was ever cheerful yet or could possibly be able to assume even the semblance of carelessness or ease upon any occasion whatsoever  in the latter part of this scene poor hastings just before he mounts the scaffold makes a reflection which too frequently occurs to those who put their trust in princes or indeed in general to all who rest their hope on any other stay but their own uprightness and virtue  hastings o momentary grace of mortal men which we more hunt for than the grace of god who builds his hope in air of your fair looks lives like a drunken sailor on a mast ready with every nod to tumble down into the fatal bowels of the deep  act iv scene iii among the various crimes of man murder stands in a distinct class above them all except perhaps suicide as being of the same species may be allowed to rank with or even to exceed it the latter part of this position though has been disputed by some moral casuists but i shall enter no further into the argument here than just to observe that one of these acts does not shock the human mind so much as the other we are sensible of a tenderness and compassion for the unhappy selfdevoted victim but are impressed both with an horror and detestation against the homicide  but the circumstance which most eminently distinguishes both of these crimes from every other species of guilt is their being so wholly repugnant to nature in other vices we may suffer a temptation and have only a moral struggle to conquer but one must be trained be educated to these must stifle sympathy and overcome our first by a second nature  and of all murders from the days of herod to these the killing a child must surely raise a stronger war in the most hardened villains breast than the slaughter of an adult its innocence its engaging manners even its very helplessness must plead so movingly in its defense as to render the deed one should think impossible might not the idea of a childs coming so recently out of the hands of its creator serve also to impress an additional awe on the mind of the malefactor at such a time if superstition can ever be excused for its weakness it must surely be in such an instance as this  shakespeare has wrought up an horrid and affecting picture in this scene upon the latter part of this subject where he makes one of the murderers give an account of the massacre of edwards two children  tirrel the tyrannous and bloody act is done the most arch deed of piteous massacre that ever yet this land was guilty of dighton and forest whom i did suborn to do this piece of ruthless butchery albeit they were flesht villains bloody dogs melting with tenderness and mild compassion wept like two children in their deaths sad story o thus quoth dighton lay the gentle babes  thus thus quoth forest girdling one another within their innocent alabaster arms their lips were four red roses on a stalk and in their summer beauty kissed each other a book of prayers on their pillow lay which once quoth forest almost changed my mind  but oh the devil  there the villain stopped when dighton thus told on  we smothered the most replenished sweet work of nature that from the prime creation ever she framed  hence both are gone with conscience and remorse they could not speak  in the latter part of the same scene is expressed a just and spirited maxim which i believe will be sufficiently vouched by experience that in difficult matters quick resolves and brisk actions generally succeed better than slow counsels and circumspect conduct  richard on hearing of the defection of his forces come i have learned that fearful commenting is leaden servitor to dull delay delay leads impotent and snailpaced beggary  then fiery expedition be my wing joves mercury and herald for a king go muster men my council is my shield we must be brief when traitors brave the field   scene iv the temporary relief which an opportunity of expressing its sorrows affords to the mind of a person in affliction is poetically described in a passage here  the queen and duchess of york duchess why should calamity be full of words   queen windy attorneys to their clientwoes airy succeeders of intestate joys intestate joys this expression is difficult the only editor who has taken notice of it is theobald but his comment is as obscure as the text i shall not attempt it  poor breathing orators of miseries let them have scope though what they do impart help nothing else yet they do ease the heart  act v scene v in this scene the adverse camps are supposed to be pitched near each other at night ready to join battle in the morning and in the space between the spirits of all the persons murdered by richard arise threatening destruction to him and promising success to richmond but the ghosts here are not to be taken literally they are to be understood only as an allegorical representation of those images or ideas which naturally occur to the minds of men during their sleep referring to the actions of their lives whether good or bad  sweet are the slumbers of the virtuous man says addison in his cato and a modern writer in a poem on the subject of dreams most emphatically expresses himself thus nor are the oppressors crimes in sleep forgot he starts appalled for conscience slumbers not something new chap xlix    that this is the sense in which our poet meant this scene to be accepted is fully evident from his representing both richard and richmond to have been asleep during the apparition and therefore capable of receiving those notices in the minds eye only as hamlet says which entirely removes the seeming absurdity of such an exhibition  the soliloquy of selfaccusation which richard enters upon alone immediately after the spectral vision is closed though so strongly marked is nothing more than might be supposed natural in the circumstances and situation of the speaker as there described  richard starting from his couch give me another horse  bind up my wounds  have mercy jesu  soft i did but dream o coward conscience how do thou afflict me the lights burn blue  is it not dead midnight cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh  what do i fear myself there is none else by my conscience has a thousand several tongues and every tongue brings in a several tale and every tale condemns me for a villain all several sins all used in each degree throng to the bar all crying guilty guilty i shall despair  there is no creature loves me and if i die no soul shall pity me nay wherefore should they since even i myself find in myself no pity for myself enter ratcliff richard who is there   ratcliff my lord the early village cock has twice done salutation to the morn your friends are up and buckle on their armor  richard ratcliff i fear i fear   ratcliff nay good my lord be not afraid of shadows   richard by the apostle paul shadows tonight have struck more terror to the soul of richard than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers armed in proof and led by shallow richmond  i shall here close my observations on this play with a reflection upon the last paragraph above  such is the nature of man that the slightest alarm arising from within discomfits him more than the greatest dangers presenting themselves from without body may be overcome by body but the mind only can conquer itself notions of religion are natural to all men in some sort or other the good are inspired by devotion the bad terrified by superstition the admonitions of conscience are taken for supernatural emotions and this awes us more than any difficulty in the common course of things man has been severally defined a risible a rational a religious and a bashful animal may i take the liberty of adding the farther criterion of his being a conscientious one and this distinction i shall venture to say is less equivocal than any of the others  henry the eighth dramatis personae men henry the eighth duke of norfolk duke of buckingham cardinal wolsey cardinal campeius legate from the pope capucius ambassador from the emperor charles the fifth lord chamberlain lord sands sir thomas lovell cromwell secretary to wolsey griffith gentleman usher to queen catharine groom of the chambers to the queen a messenger women queen catharine anne bullen patience lady of the bedchamber to the queen henry the eighth act i scene i as cardinal wolsey stands a distinguished character in history having raised himself from the meanest origin he was the son of a butcher to the highest pitch of power consideration and station that a subject could well arrive at by the sole advantages of learning and natural endowments and whose end was unfortunate through vanity insolence and the unstable favor of princes there may be an useful lesson deduced from every circumstance of his life respecting either his rise grandeur or decline  in a dialogue between buckingham and norfolk in this scene the former speaking of his vanity and presumption with that contempt which persons of noble families and hereditary fortunes are sometimes too apt to express toward men whose whole worth is centered in themselves the latter engages in his defense upon a very just and liberal argument  norfolk yet surely sir there is in him stuff that puts him to these ends for not being propt by ancestry whose grace chalks successors their way nor called upon for high feats done to the crown neither allied to eminent assistants but spiderlike out of his selfdrawing web  this gives us note the force of his own merit makes his way a gift that heaven gives to him which buys a place next to the king  doctor young treats the same subject in as proper a manner but with the addition of satire and ridicule  let high birth triumph what can be more great nothing  but merit in a low estate univer pas scene ii the angry duke repeats his spleen against him in this scene also upon the same proud prejudice or mistaken estimate of things  buckingham a beggarsbook outworths a nobles blood   this most noble and puissant prince the style and title of a duke was unlucky in having lived in such an ignoble age  nobles meet with no such mortifications nowadays  in the continuation of this dialogue the impatient spirit of buckingham is finely contrasted with the calm temper of norfolk who illustrates his documents of prudence to him with equal philosophy and poesy  the cardinal had just crossed the scene in all his state casting a look of disdain on buckingham which the more raised his choler  norfolk what are you chafed ask god for temperance that is the appliance only which your disease requires  buckingham i read ins look matter against me and his eye reviled me as his abject object at this instant he bores i do not comprehend the meaning of this expression and the commentators have given me no assistance me with some trick he is gone to the king  i will follow and outstare him  norfolk stay my lord and let your reason with your choler question what it is you go about to climb steep hills requires slow pace at first anger is like a fullhot horse who being allowed his way self mettle tires him not a man in england can advise me like you  be to yourself as you would to your friend  buckingham i will to the king and from a mouth of honor quite cry down this ipswich the place of wolseys nativity fellows insolence or proclaim there is difference in no persons  norfolk be advised heat not a furnace for your foe so hot that it shall singe yourself we may outrun by overswiftness that which we run at and lose by overrunning  know you not the fire that mounts the liquor till t run over seeming to augment but wastes it be advised i say again there is no english soul more stronger to direct you than yourself if with the sap of reason you would quench or but allay the fire of passion  the character which norfolk here gives to buckingham of himself is too common in life persons whose sense and judgment are sufficiently qualified to direct others but who from the force of passion and indiscretion are rendered incapable of guiding themselves to advise and to be advised are by no means the active and passive of the same verb as they differ so widely in their moods and tenses i have made my apology before hen vi part ii act ii scene ii the note  for such jeux de mots which our authors style is apt to lead one into  scene iv there is an excellent lesson for kings given in this place as well as in many other passages of shakespeare the honor and safety of princes are so much confided to the sense and conduct of their ministers that such trustees for the state should be ever selected with the nicest judgment and strictest impartiality in which choice virtue should be at least equally regarded with talents were the crown testamentary a sovereign should be circumspect to whose hands he entrusted the government of his people even after his death and how much more solicitous ought he to be with respect to those appointed to rule while his own glory and interest lie so immediately at stake  the great conde complimented corneilles play of cinna by stiling it the breviary of kings  i think that many of shakespeares pieces much better deserve that name but indeed his writings may well challenge a more general and comprehensive title and be called the manual of mankind as containing rules and reflections for every state and condition of life throughout the entire compass of human nature from the peasant to the prince  the council chamber the king the cardinal and the nobles seated the queen enters walks up to the foot of the throne and kneels before the king in the quality of a suitor catharine i am solicited not by a few and those of true condition that your subjects are in great grievance there have been commissions sent down among them which have flawed the heart of all their loyalties wherein although my good lord cardinal they vent reproaches most bitterly on you as putter on of these exactions yet the king our master whose honor heaven shield from soil even e escapes not language unmannerly yea such which breaks the sdes of loyalty and almost appears in loud rebellion this makes bold mouths tongues spit their duties out and cold hearts freeze allegiance in them all their curses now live where their prayers did and it is come to pass that tractable obedience is a slave to each incensed will i would your highness would give it quick consideration for there is no primer business  but before we close this scene let us show our impartiality by suffering the minister to speak a few words in his own defense which he does very well by urging reflections that have a good deal of truth in them and show the danger and difficulty of such a station even in the best and ablest hands  wolsey if i am traduced by tongues which neither know my faculties or person yet will be the chronicles of my doing let me say it is but the fate of place and the rough brake that virtue must go through we must not stint our necessary actions in the fear to cope malicious censurers which ever as ravenous fishes do a vessel follow that is new trimmed but benefit no further than vainly longing what we often do best by sick interpreters or weak ones is not ours or not allowed what worst as often hitting a grosser quality quality for conception  is cried up for our best act if we stand still in fear our motion will be mocked or carped at we should take root here where we sit or sit statestatues only  scene vi the following scene must have had an admirable effect at the time of its first representation nor indeed is it passed by even now without applause from the pit and galleries where the most rational and virtuous part of our audiences are generally seated though it may perhaps be looked upon but as a remain of our ancient barbarism by the boxes among

take it they may cum privilegio wear away the lagend of their lewdness and be laughed at  sands it is time to give them physic their diseases are grown so catching  act ii scene ii here the unhappy buckingham in his last speech as it may be called just before his execution on recapitulating the vicissitudes and misfortunes of his family makes proper reflections on the indiscretion of placing a confidence in the fidelity of mean dependants  whether it arises from low birth or base condition of life which are apt to depress the native vigor of the mind and render all its principles and ideas servile and selfish i shall not loiter here to make an inquisition into it being sufficient to the present argument that the fact itself from the experience of mankind affords us but too much authority to pronounce the truth of the observation  buckingham my noble father henry of buckingham who first raised head against usurping richard flying for succor to his servant banister being distressed was by that wretch betrayed henry the eighth life name honor and all that made me happy at one stroke has taken for ever from the world thus far we are one in fortune both fell by our servants this duke was betrayed by his surveyor chancellor and confessor  by those men we loved most a most unnatural and faithless service heaven has an end in all  yet you that hear me this from a dying man receive as certain where you are liberal of your loves and counsels be sure you are not loose those you make friends and give your hearts to when they once perceive the least rub in your fortunes fall away like water from ye never found again but where they mean to sink ye all good people pray for me i must leave ye the last hour of my long weary life is come upon me farewell and when you would say something sad speak how i fell  i have done and god forgive me  i designed to have left off above at the period in the last line but four as the speech ended properly there as far as it related to the argument i had framed upon it but i actually felt myself impressed with somewhat like an idea of impiety to interrupt the speaker before he had concluded his prayer  i am sensible of a certain refined pleasure in the sentiment which prompted my pen further on this passage however the stronger mind of the reader may amuse himself at the weakness and superstition of my motive  scene vi the character of queen catharine is finely drawn in this play a becoming demeanor is preserved throughout every situation and circumstance she is placed in she discovers that dignity and spirit which become the wife and daughter of a king shows the duty and obedience which a husband and a sovereign have a right to claim and speaks on her own part with such a noble confidence as injured innocence may fully warrant one can never be too much assured in a just cause either of their own or of others for whoever defends the rights of the oppressed fights under the banner of providence  i shall not interrupt the following dialogues as far as they relate to her to point out the passages which may be applied to the several parts of the character above given of her but as in former instances of the same kind in the course of these notes shall leave the reader to mark and refer them himself as he goes along  blackfriars the king with his bishops nobles etc assembled in a council of inquest to try the validity of the marriage where catharine appears as summoned on the examination crier catharine queen of england come into the court   the queen makes no answer but rising from her seat goes to the king kneels and then speaks catharine sir i desire you do me right and justice and to bestow your pity on me for i am a most poor woman and a stranger born out of your dominions having here no judge indifferent impartial  and no more assurance of equal friendship and proceeding alas sir in what have i offended you what cause has my behavior given to your displeasure that thus you should proceed to put me off and take your good grace from me heaven witness i have been to you a true and humble wife at all times to your will conformable ever in fear to kindle your dislike yea subject to your countenance glad or sorry as i saw it inclined when was the hour i ever contradicted your desire or made it not mine too which of your friends have i not strove to love although i knew he were mine enemy what friend of mine that had to him derived your anger did i continue in my liking nay gave not notice he was from thence discharged sir call to mind that i have been your wife in this obedience upward of twenty years and have been blessed with many children by you if in the course and process of this time you can report and prove it too against mine honor aught my bond of wedlock or my love and duty against your sacred person in gods name turn me away and let the foulst contempt shut door upon me and so give me up to the sharpest kind of justice please you sir the king your father was reputed for a prince most prudent of an excellent and unmatched wit and judgment ferdinand my father king of spain was reckoned one the wisest prince that there had reigned by many a year before it is not to be questioned that they had gathered a wise council to them of every realm that did debate this business who deemed our marriage lawful wherefore humbly sir i beseech you spare me till i may be by my friends in spain advised whose counsel i will implore if not in the name of god your pleasure be fulfilled rises  wolsey you have here lady and of your choice these reverend fathers men of singular integrity and learning yea the elect of the land who are assembled to plead your cause it shall be therefore bootless that longer you defer the court as well for your own quiet as to rectify what is unsettled in the king  campeius his grace has spoken well and justly therefore madam it is fit this royal session do proceed and that without delay their arguments be now produced and heard  catharine lord cardinal to you i speak  wolsey your pleasure madam   catharine sir i am about to weep but thinking that we are a queen or long have dreamed so certain the daughter of a king my drops of tears i will turn to sparks of fire  wolsey be patient yet   catharine i will when you are humble  nay before  induced by potent circumstances that you are mine enemy i make my challenge challenge is a law term for persons on their trial objecting to a juryman  you shall not be my judge for it is you have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me which gods dew quench therefore i say again i utterly abhor yea from my soul refuse you for my judge whom yet once more i hold my most malicious foe and think not at all a friend to truth  here wolsey enters into a justification of himself in a long speech which relates not to the present purpose in which he demeans himself with great respect toward the queen and speaks in his own defense with all seeming moderation and temper  to which she replies catharine my lord my lord i am a simple woman much too weak to oppose your cunning you are meek and humblemouthed you sign sign  that is you make an outward show of your holy function your place and calling in full seeming with meekness and humility but your heart is crammed with arrogance spleen and pride you have by fortune and his highness favors gone slightly over low steps and now are mounted where powers are your retainers and your words domestics to you serve your will ast please yourself pronounce their office you have arrived at such an height of power that you may do and undo or say and unsay whatever you please without control  i must tell you you tender more your persons honor than your high profession spiritual that again i do refuse you for my judge and here before ye all appeal unto the pope to bring my whole cause before his holiness and to be judged by him    here she makes an obeissance to the king and offers to depart the court  campeius the queen is obstinate stubborn to justice apt to accuse it and disdainful to be tried by it  it is not well  she is going away  henry call her again   crier catharine queen of england come into the court   griffith madam you are called back   catharine what need you note it pray you keep your way  when you are called return  now the lord help they vex me past my patience pray you pass on i will not tarry  no nor ever more upon this business my appearance make in any of their courts  exeunt queen and her train act iii scene i i shall not prevent the readers own feelings and reflections upon this fine and affecting scene in which the queens character is further displayed by any remarks of my own upon the several parts of it  the queens apartment the queen and her women as at work this is an antiquated english scene but has been revived again i hear by her majesty in the present reign who shines penelope among her chosen female band who ply the needles art

withdraw into your private chamber we shall give you the full cause of our coming  catharine speak it here there is nothing i have done yet of my conscience deserves a corner  would all other women could speak this with as free a soul as i do my lords i care not so much i am happy above a number if my actions were tried by every tongue every eye saw them envy and base opinion set against em i know my life so even if your business do seek me out and that way i am wise in that is if you are come to examine my title as a wise or my behavior under that character johnson  out with it boldly truth loves open dealing  wolsey tanta est erga te mentis integritas regina serenissima   catharine o good my lord no latin i am not such a truant since my coming as not to know the language i have lived in a strange tongue makes my cause more strange suspicious pray speak in english here are some will thank you if you speak truth for their poor mistress sake believe me she has had much wrong lord cardinal the willingst sin i ever yet committed may be absolved in english  wolsey noble lady i am sorry my integrity to you and service to his majesty should breed i have ventured to transpose some of the words in these two lines in order to render the sense more intelligible  so deep suspicion where all faith was meant we come not by the way of accusation to taint that honor every good tongue blesses nor to betray you any way to sorrow you have too much good lady but to know how you stand minded in the weighty difference between the king and you and to deliver like free and honest men our just opinions and comforts to your cause  campeius most honored madam my lord of york wolsey was archbishop of york  out of his noble nature zeal and obedience he still bears your grace forgetting like a good man your late censure both of his truth and him which was too far offers as i do in a sign of peace his service and his counsel   catharine to betray me my lords i thank you both for your good wills ye speak like honest men pray god ye prove so but how to make ye suddenly an answer in such a point of weight so near mine honor more near my life i fear with my weak wit and to such men of gravity and learning in truth i know not i was set at work among my maids full little god knows looking either for such men or such business for her sake that i have been for i feel the last fit of my greatness good your graces let me have time and counsel for my cause alas i am a woman friendless hopeless  wolsey madam you wrong the kings love with those fears your hopes and friends are infinite  catharine in england but little for my profit can you think lords that any english man dare give me counsel or be a known friend against his highness pleasure though he be grown so desperate to be honest and live a subject nay forsooth  my friends they that must weigh out the edtors are at a loss about this expression to weigh out certainly means here to unload it is a mercantile phrase for unfreighting a cargo my afflictions they that my trust must grow to live not here they are as all my comforts are far hence in my own country lords  campeius i would your grace would leave your griefs and take my counsel  catharine how sir   campeius put your main cause into the kings protection he is loving and most gracious twill be much both for your honor better and your cause for if the trial of the law overtake you you will part away disgraced  wolsey he tells you rightly   catharine ye tell me what ye wish for both my ruin  is this your christian counsel out upon ye heaven is above all yet there sits a judge that no king can corrupt  campeius your rage mistakes us   catharine the more shame for you  holy men i thought ye upon my soul two reverend cardinal virtues but cardinal sins and hollow hearts i fear you mend them for shame my lords is this your comfort the cordial that you bring a wretched lady a woman lost among ye laughed at scorned i will not wish you half my miseries  i have more charity but say i warned ye take heed take heed for heavens sake lest at once the burden of my sorrows fall upon you  wolsey madam this is a mere distraction  you turn the good we offer into envy envy put for malice or mischief   catharine ye turn me into nothing woe upon you and all such false professors would ye have me if ye have any justice any pity if ye be any thing but churchmens habits put my sick cause into his hands that hates me alas h as banished me his bed already his love too long ago i am old my lords and all the fellowship i hold now with him is only my obedience what can happen to me above this wretchedness all your studies make me a curse like this  campeius your fears are worse   catharine have i lived thus long  let me speak myself since virtue finds no friends a wife a true one a woman i dare say without vain glory never yet branded with suspicion have i with all my full affections still met the king loved him next heaven obeyed him almost forgot my prayers to content him and am i thus rewarded it is not well lords bring me a constant woman to her husband one that never dreamed a joy beyond his pleasure and to that woman when she has done most yet will i add an honor  a great patience  wolsey madam you wander from the good we aim at   catharine my lord i dare not make myself so guilty to give up willingly that noble title your master wed me to nothing but death shall ever divorce my dignities  wolsey pray hear me   catharine would i had never trod this english earth or felt the flatteries that grow upon it yeve angels faces but heaven knows your hearts  what shall become of me now wretched lady i am the most unhappy woman living alas poor wenches where are now your fortunes to her women shipwreckd upon a kingdom where no pity no friends no hope no kindred weep for me almost no grave allowed me like the lily that once was mistress of the field and flourished i will hang my head and perish  wolsey if your grace could but be brought to know our ends are honest you would feel more comfort why should we good lady upon what cause wrong you alas our places the way of our profession is against it we are to cure such sorrows not to sow them for goodness sake consider what you do how you may hurt yourself nay utterly grow from the kings acquaintance by this carriage the hearts of princes kiss obedience so much they love it but to stubborn spirits they swell and grow as terrible as storms i know you have a gentle noble temper a soul as even as a calm pray think think us those we profess peacemakers friends and servants  campeius madam you will find it so you wrong your virtues with these weak womans fears a noble spirit as yours was put into you ever casts such doubts as false coin from it the king loves you beware you lose it not for us if you please to trust us in your business we are ready to use our utmost studies in your service  catharine do what you will my lords and pray forgive me if i have used myself unmannerly you know i am a woman lacking wit to make a seemly answer to such persons pray do my service to his majesty he has my heart yet and shall have my prayers while i shall have my life come reverend fathers bestow your counsels on me she now begs that little thought when she set footing here she should have bought her dignities so dear exeunt  scene vi the present scene presents us with a second object of compassion which though it interests us after a different manner from the former as neither being so innocent nor suffering so unjustly yet shall i hazard the expression affects us almost as much we do not indeed feel our minds impressed with such a tender sensibility toward the latter as the first but for the honor and dignity of human nature let me say that our commiseration in the second case arises from principles of a nobler kind from our forgiveness of the penitent and our compassion for his misfortunes softened still more by our sorrow for his guilt so that upon the whole the generosity of our sentiment in one instance nearly equals the sympathy of it in the other  the true supputation of the precariousness and instability of all worldly happiness and greatness with the fit temper and resignation to bear their loss are most pathetically and poetically set forth in the following beautiful and affecting scene  wolsey in his disgrace farewell a long farewell to all my greatness this is the state of man  today he puts forth the tender leaves of hopes tomorrow blossoms and bears his blushing honors thick upon him the third day comes a frost a killing frost and when he thinks good easy man full surely his greatness is a ripening nips his root and then he falls as i do i have ventured like little wanton boys that swim on bladders these many summers in a sea of glory but far beyond my depth my highblown pride at length broke under me and now has left me weary and old with service to the mercy of a rude stream that must for ever hide me vain pomp and glory of this world i hate ye  i feel my heart new opened  oh how wretched is that poor man that hangs on princes favors there is between that smile we would aspire to that sweet aspect of princes and our ruin more pangs and fears than war or women have and when he fails he falls like lucifer nevr to hpe again enter cromwell standing amazd why how now cromwell  cromwell i have no power to speak sir   wolsey what amazed at my misfortunes can thy spirit wonder a great man should decline nay if you weep i am fallen indeed  cromwell how does your grace   wolsey why well  never so truly happy my good cromwell i know myself now and i feel within me a peace above all earthly dignities a still and quiet conscience  the king has cured me i humbly thank his grace  and from these shoulders these ruined pillars out of pity taken a load would sink a navy too much honor o it is a burden cromwell it is a burden too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven  cromwell i am glad your grace has made that right use of it   wolsey i hope i have i am able now methinks out of a fortitude of soul i feel to endure more miseries and greater far than my weakhearted enemies dare offer what news abroad  cromwell the heaviest and the worst is your displeasure with the king  wolsey god bless him   cromwell the next is that sir thomas more is chosen lord chancellor in your place  wolsey that is somewhat sudden  but he is a learned man may he continue long in his highness favor and do justice for truths sake and his conscience that his bones when he has run his course and sleeps in blessings may have a tomb of orphans tears wept on them what more  cromwell that cranmer is returned with welcome installed lord archbishop of canterbury  wolsey that is news indeed   cromwell last that the lady anne whom the king has in secrecy long married this day was viewed in open as his queen going to chapel and the voice is now only about her coronation  wolsey there was the weight that pulled me down o cromwell the king has gone beyond me all my glories in that one woman i have lost for ever no sun shall ever usher forth my honors or gild again the noble troops that waited upon my smiles go get thee from me cromwell i am a poor fallen man unworthy now to be thy lord and master seek the king that sun i pray may never set i have told him what and how true thou art he will advance thee some little memory of me will stir him i know his noble nature not to let thy hopeful service perish too good cromwell neglect him not make use now and provide for thine own future safety  cromwell o my lord must i then leave you must i needs forego so good so noble and so true a master bear witness all that have not hearts of iron with what a sorrow cromwell leaves his lord the king shall have my service but my prayers for ever and for ever shall be yours  wolsey cromwell i did not think to shed a tear in all my miseries but thou have forced me out of thy honest truth to play the woman let us dry our eyes and thus far hear me cromwell and when i am forgotten as i shall be and sleep in dull cold marble where no mention of me must more be heard say then i taught thee say wolsey that once rode the waves rode the waves instead of trod the waves so altered by warburton to preserve the metaphor pointed out in the two next lines waves depth shoals and  of glory and sounded all the depths and shoals of honor found thee a way out of his wreck to rise in a sure and safe one though thy master missed it mark but my fall and that which ruined me  cromwell i charge thee fling away ambition by that sin fell the angels how can man then the image of his maker hope to win by it love thyself last cherish those hearts that wait wait instead of bate warburton a more natural sensible and political sense of the passage thee corruption wins not more than honesty still in thy right hand carry gentle peace to silence envious tongues be just and fear not let all the ends thou aimst at be thy countrys thy gods and truths  then if thou failest o cromwell thou fallest a blessed martyr serve the king and prithee lead me in  there take an inventory of all i have to the last penny it is the kings my robe and my integrity to heaven is all i dare now call my own o cromwell cromwell had i but served my god with half the zeal i served my king he would not in mine age have left me naked to mine enemies this last sentence wolsey did really speak as recorded in history   cromwell good sir have patience   wolsey so i have farewell the hopes of court my hopes in heaven do dwell  act iv scene ii our first great object before mentioned is here presented to us again to charm us with that truly christian spirit with which though deeply suffering under the supposed enmity of wolsey she not only forgives him her injuries but listens to his praise without resentment and even commends his honest welsh encomiast  kimbolton castle enter catharine sick and led in between griffith her gentleman usher and patience her woman griffith how does your grace   catharine o griffith sick to death my legs like loaded branches bow to the earth willing to leave their burden reach a chair  so  now methinks i feel a little ease sitting down did thou not tell me griffith as thou ledst me that the great child of honor cardinal wolsey was dead  griffith yes madam but i think your grace out of the pain you suffered gave no ear to it  catharine prithee good griffith tell me how he died  if well he stepped before me happily for my example  griffith well the voice goes madam for after the stout earl of northumberland arrested him at york and brought him forward as a man sorely tainted to his answer he fell sick suddenly and grew so ill he could not sit his mule  catharine alas poor man   griffith at last with easy roads he came to leister lodged in the abbey where the reverend abbot with all his convent honorably received him to whom he gave these words o father abbot an old man broken with the storms of state is come to lay his weary bones among ye give him a little earth for charity these words are likewise recorded of him  so went to bed where eagerly his sickness pursued him still and three nights after this about the hour of eight which he himself foretold should be his last full of repentance continual meditations tears and sorrows he gave his honors to the world again his blessed part to heaven and slept in peace  catharine so may he rest his faults lie gently on him yet thus far griffith give me leave to speak him and yet with charity he was a man of an unbounded stomach ever ranking himself with princes one that by suggestion suggestion by having the freedom of the kings ear he had an opportunity of suggesting his own schemes and politics into his mind  tied all the kingdom simony was fair play  his own opinion was his law in the presence he would say untruths and be ever double both in his words and meaning he was never but where he meant to ruin pitiful his promises were as he then was mighty but his performance as he now is nothing of his own body he was ill and gave the clergy ill example  griffith noble madam mens evil manners live in brass their virtues we write in water may it please your highness to hear me speak his good now  catharine yes good griffith  i were malicious else  grifth this cardinal though from an humble stock undoubtedly was fashioned to much honor from his cradle this line is thus pointed in the text was fashioned to much honor from his crade the alteration i have made in the stop gives the best sense of the passage for wolsey was a remarkable scholar even in his infancy  he was a scholar and a ripe and good one exceeding wise fair spoken and persuading lofty and sour to them that loved him not but to those men that sought him sweet as summer and though he were unsatisfied in getting which was a sin yet in bestowing madam he was most princely ever witness for him those twins of learning that he raised in you ipswich and oxford one of which fell with him unwilling to outlive the good he did it the other though unfinished yet so famous so excellent in art and still so rising that christendom shall ever speak his virtue his overthrow heaped happiness upon him for then and not till then he felt himself and found the blessedness of being little  and to add greater honors to his age than man could give him he died fearing god  catharine after my death i wish no other herald no other speaker of my living actions to keep mine honor from corruption but such an honest chronicler as griffith whom i most hated living thou have made me with thy religious truth and modesty now in his ashes honor peace be with him patience the name of her woman  be near me still and set me lower i have not long to trouble thee good griffith cause the musicians play me that sad note i named my knell whilst i sit meditating on that celestial harmony i go to  sad and solemn music and a vision of cherubims while she sleeps here the reader will please to advert to my remark on the vision in scene the fifth of the last act of the preceding play this one also was meant by shakespeare but as an allegorical representation of those beatific dreams or reveries which the virtuous mind and clear conscience may be supposed sometimes to be inspired with  catharine waking bid the music leave it is harsh and heavy to me music ceases enter lord capucius if my sight fail not you should be lord ambassador from the emperor my royal nephew and your name capucius capucius madam the same your servant   catharine o my lord the times and titles are now altered strangely with me since first you knew me but i pray you what is your pleasure with me  capucius noble lady first mine own service to your grace the next the kings request that i would visit you who grieves much for your weakness and by me sends you his princely commendations and heartily entreats you take good comfort  catharine o my good lord that comfort comes too late it is like a pardon after execution that gentle physic given in time had cured me but now i am past all comforts here but prayers how does his highness  capucius madam in good health   catharine so may he ever do and ever flourish when i shall dwell with worms and my poor name banished the kingdom  ptience is that letter i caused you write yet sent away  patience no madam gives it to her   catharine sir i most humbly pray you to deliver this to my lord the king  capucius most willing madam   catharine in which i have commended to his goodness the model of our chaste loves his young daughter afterward queen mary  the dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding she is young and of a noble modest nature i hope she will deserve well and a little to love her for her mothers sake that loved him heaven knows how dearly my next poor petition is that his noble grace would have some pity upon my wretched women that so long have followed both my fortunes faithfully of which there is not one i dare avow and now i should not lie but well deserves for virtue and true beauty of the soul for honesty and decency of carriage a right good husband let him be a noble and sure those men are happy that shall have em the last is for my men they are the poorest but poverty could never draw them from me that they may have their wages duly paid them and something over to remember me if heaven had pleased to have given me longer life and abler means we had not parted thus these are the whole contents and good my lord by that you love the dearest in the world as you wish christian peace to souls departed stand these poor peoples friend and urge the king to do me this last right  capucius by heaven i will or let me lose the fashion of a man  catharine i thank you honest lord remember me in all humility unto his highness and tell him his long trouble now is passing out of this world tell him in death i blessed him for so i will  mine eyes grow dim farewell my lord  griffith farewell  nay patience you must not leave me yet i must to bed  call in more women  when i am dead good wench let me be used with honor  strew me over with maiden flowers that all the world may know i was a chaste wife to my grave  embalm me then lay me forth  although unqueened yet like a queen and daughter to a king interr me i can no more   doctor johnson has given us his sentiments on this rich and noble passage in the following words  this scene is above any other part of shakespeares tragedies and perhaps above any scene of any other poet tender and pathetic without gods or furies or poisons or precipices without the help of romantic circumstances without improbable sallies of poetical lamentation and without any throes of tumultuous misery lear dramatis personae men lear albany kent gloucester edgar edmund fool gentlemen and attendants women goneril regan cordelia scene lies in britain  lear it may be necessary to many readers to premise that the piece here under consideration is the play as originally written by shakespeare left the bearing it in mind as altered by tate and generally acted so might occasion confusion or mistakes in the following notes and observations  the critics are divided in their opinions between the original and the altered copy some prefer the first as a more general representation of human life where fraud too often succeeds and innocence suffers others prefer the latter as a more moral description of what life should be  but argument in this as in many other cases had better be left quite out of the question for our feelings are often a surer guide than our reason and by this criterion i may venture to pronounce that the reader or spectator will always be better pleased with the happy than the unfortunate catastrophe of innocence and virtue  besides if dramatic exhibitions are designed as they certainly should be to recommend virtue and discourage vice there cannot remain the least manner of dispute in our minds whether shakespeare or tate have fulfilled horaces precept of utile dulci the best however if pity and terror as the critics say are the principal objects of tragedy surely no play that ever was written can possibly answer both these ends better than this performance as it stands in the present text  the reader i hope will not think that i have exceeded the line i had prescribed to myself in the conduct of this work by my hazarding the above criticism as the subject may be still considered as of a moral nature or tendency and may therefore not improperly be consorted with the rest of my remarks upon this estimable author  act i scene i kent and gloucester kent i thought the king had more affected the duke of albany than cornwall   gloucester it did always seem so to us but now in his division of the kingdom it appears not which of the dukes he values most for qualities are so weighed that curiosity curiosity for scrutiny in neither can make choice of eithers moiety   this is a fine description of a parents distributive justice in the division of a fortune between his children their claims are all equal in nature and should be still preserved so in equity except where particular usages may have obtained or political laws have made a difference in which cases to observe the rule of nature would be a species of injustice  i speak here with regard to conduct of principle only and not of affection for it is often impossible for the most virtuous or impartial parent to refrain from loving one child better than another a inndiscriminate regard in any case toward two objects though ever so much alike or estimable is unnatural to the most impartial mind and though our reason should not be able to give a preference our feelings will  the oftdisputed free will of man may be sufficiently proved from this innate selfdetermination which his mind possesses we must make a choice even without our being able to make a distinction it must be an ass indeed that can remain in suspense even between two bundles of hay but this involuntary election we are not answerable for in ethics we are accountable only for our manner of acting toward our children in which their moral merits alone can justify superior marks of preference or favor  scene ii lear and it is our fast intent to shake all cares and business from our age conferring them on younger strengths while we unburdened crawl toward death  this is a rational a manly and a virtuous purpose but how few are possessed of souls great enough to relinquish greatness indeed the rare examples of those who have done so as charles the fifth and some others would not encourage one to make the experiment but then it ought to be enquired into whether the instances of abdication had been prompted by any of the principles abovementioned or no for mere fits of devotion or disgust are seldom long or strong enough to support the mind under such a dereliction  besides habit is a most powerful thing and persons used to occupation of any kind are apt to feel an irksome vacuity and weariness in themselves with an oppressive tediousness of time lying on their hands whenever they cease from employment this has been the confession of all the merchants lawyers farmers and physicians i have ever known or heard of who had retired from their professions or quitted their ordinary scenes of action late in life whenever therefore such an experiment is attempted it should arise from a principle not from a preference because the choice must be ventured upon before the comparison can be tried  in the same scene when lear requires his three daughters to declare the several portions of their love and respect toward him the eldest addresses herself to him thus goneril sir i love you more than words can wield the matter dearer than eyesight space and liberty beyond what can be valued rich or rare no less than life with grace health beauty honor as much as child ever loved or father found a love that makes breath poor and speech unable beyond all manner of so much i love you    upon this speech the youngest daughter says to herself aside what shall cordelia do love and be silent  after goneril has had her portion marked out the second steps forward in order to earn here is  regan i am made of that selfmetal as my sister and prize me at her worth in my true heart i find she names my very deed of love only she comes too short that i profess myself an enemy to all other joys which the most precious square of sense possesses and find i am alone felicitate in your dear highness love  here the sincere and unprofessing cordelia whispers to herself again then poor cordelia and yet not so since i am sure my loves more ponderous than my tongue   when lear has endowed regan also he next proceeds to challenge cordelia upon the same question asking her what she has to say to show her love equal to her sisters her only answer is nothing my lord  but indeed what was there left for her to say after such hyperbolical professions as had been just made before her however i dare pronounce that any reader who is at all acquainted with human nature without looking any further into the story beyond the present scene must have already determined the point in his own mind which of the daughters duties or affections were most to be relied upon  no passion can either bear or justify exaggeration but love alone there the extravagance of transport and the enthusiasm of devotement prove the luxuriance of the soil but in every other instance betray the sterility of it there is in reality no other passion in the human breast but love all other affections such as avarice duty envy revenge or ambition arise from some foreign sentiment are founded on principle or instigated by vice or pride these we may be educated tempted or provoked to but the former is a spontaneous and involuntary impulse of the soul a certain attractive force that can neither be dictated to us by moral nor restrained by document  first bid physicians preach our veins to temper and with an argument new set a pulse then think of reasoning into love the revenge scene vi edmund solus thou nature art my goddess to thy law my services are bound wherefore should i stand in the plague the commentators are not agreed upon the sense of this word in the place where it is here used but i think that the meaning of it would be sufficiently clear if it was exchanged for tyranny of custom and permit the courtesy by courtesy is meant certain usages so styled in the common law of england of nations to deprive me thus do all profligates who deserve to be the outcasts of society betake themselves to the asylum of nature whenever the laws of god or man oppose their vices they immediately adopt her for their deity and their legislator whom they cannot fail to find a most indulgent patroness as they are sure to interpret all their own wills and passions to be her unerring dictates  lucretius the expositor of epicurus in his unphilosophic poem on the nature of things addresses himself to the same goddess under the appellation of venus whom he makes to precede and supersede the gods representing them as a set of lethargic beings of her creation and leaving them to doze away their immortalities wrapped up in their empyreal pantheon  the pride of man is amazing rather than acknowledge any intelligence superior to themselves they choose to refer the manifest wisdom and power of the deity to blind chance and inert matter alone and call gods providence a lucky hit  pope and yet this can hardly be deemed impious because it is so miserably stupid  scene vii shakespeare as i have had opportunities of observing before takes frequent occasions of representing the horrid condition of a nation under the infliction of a civil war his descriptions deserve to be collected together into one chapter as a document both to prince and people for the warning is equally necessary to each as whatever may be the final event they must be alike sufferers under such a calamity for in such a conflict those are likely to gain most who have the least to lose these reflections refer to the following passage in this scene  gloucester love cools friendship falls off brothers divide in cities mutinies in countries discord in palaces treason and the bond cracked twixt son and father we have seen the best of our time machinations hollowness treachery and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves   scene viii the impious and unphilosophic method that people are too generally apt to apply toward the lightening of their consciences and relieving their miseries by imputing their vices and misfortunes to fate necessity or the harmless stars presiding at their births instead of their own wickedness or indiscretions is well satirized and exposed in the following speech though it has not i think been put into a proper mouth to speak  emund this is the excellent foppery of the world that when we are sick in fortune often the surfeits of our own behavior we make guilty of our own disasters the sun the moon and stars as if we were villains on necessity fools by heavenly compusion knaves thieves and treacherous by spherical predominance drunkards liars and adulterers by an enforced obedience of planetary influence and all that we are evil in by a divine thrusting on an admirable evasion of whoremaster man to lay his goatish disposition on the change of a star   scene xii kent here gives a good character of a man in recommending his own services to lear i do profess to be no less than i seem to serve him truly that will put me in trust to love him that is honest to converse with him that is wise and says little to fear judgment to respect the laws  and to fight when i cannot choose neither forward to begin nor backward to end a fray   scene xiii the following passage comes in here very properly after the foregoing one as it gives good and prudent advice for our conduct in life  fool have more than thou show speak less than thou know lend less than thou owe to owe in old english is to own or possess  ride more than thou go learn more than thou trowest to trow is to believe the line means not to embrace all opinions because delivered under the sanction of philosophy or learning  set less than thou throwest that is never set equal to the stake you throw for  leave thy drink and thy whore and keep within door and thou shall have more than two tens to a score a phrase for improving ones capital   these maxims should not lose their credit or effect on account of the character which utters them for shakespeares fools are not those of modern times but speak a great deal of good sense throughout all his plays besides these sort of privileged persons styled formerly kings jesters were usually men of wit and parts a sort of free speakers who were indulged in a liberty of telling truths or making reflections on their masters conduct without being reprehended or restrained and as they were the only courtiers who were permitted such a license they deserved more properly to be deemed the kings friends than to have been stigmatized by either of the other denominations  scene xv the curses which the justly provoked father denounces here against his unnatural daughters are so very horrid and shocking to humanity that i shall not offend my reader by quoting them though shakespeare i am convinced supplied them merely in order to raise an abhorrence in his audience against two of the greatest crimes in the black list of deadly sins namely ingratitude and undutifulness and to show as the injured parent most emphatically expresses it in the same passage how sharper than a serpents tooth it is to have a thankless child   act ii scene vi in this same scene and upon account of kents warmth and impatience of speech and temper though still under the disguise of an hireling attendant on lear there is a very good description given of such a person as he appears to be a character frequently to be met with in life though the speaker is mistaken in the application of it to the honest duke who might very properly be said in the sense of the expression above given to have been the kings friend  cornwall this is some fellow who having been praised for bluntness does affect a sawy oghns and constrains the garb quite from his nature he cannot flatter he an honest mind and plain he must speak truth and they will ta it so  if not he is plain  these kind of  i know which in this plainness harbor more craft and more corrupter ends than twenty silly ducking observants that stretch their duties nicely  scene x when gloucester makes an apology to lear here for not pressing his son the duke of cornwall a second time to an interview with him on account of the fiery quality of the duke as also having brought an answer from him that he was not well the injured monarch resents it thus lear the king would speak with cornwall  the dear father would with his daughter speak  commands her service  are they informed of this my breath and blood fiery the fiery duke tell the hot duke that  gloucester offers to go no but not yet  may be he is not well  infirmity does still neglect all office whereto our health is bound we are not ourselves when nature being oppressed commands the mind to suffer with the body  i will forbear and am fallen out with my more headier will to take the indisposed and sickly fit for the sound man    the surprise and resentment expressed in the first part of the above speech is just and natural but the pause of recollection which afterward abates his anger is extremely fine both in the reasonableness of the reflection and the humanity of the sentiment  this beautiful passage with many others of the same tender kind which follow in the course of developing lears character and which i shall occasionally refer back from to this note render this unhappy man a real object both of commiseration and esteem notwithstanding the weakness passion and injustice he has so fully exposed in the beginning of this play  no writer that ever lived was capable of drawing a mixed character equal to shakespeare for no one has ever seemed to have dived so deep into nature as himself  frequent instances of this admirable talent in him may be selected from his works most other authors in their descriptions of men present us either with a flowery mead or a savage desert but the demesne of human nature which includes both the fruitful field and the barren waste within one enclosure is rarely delineated by common writers  scene xii lear to goneril upon her abridging his train i prithee daughter do not make me mad i will not trouble thee  my child farewell well no more meet no more see one another but yet thou art my flesh my blood my daughter or rather a disease that is in my flesh which i must needs call mine thou art a bile a plague sore or imbossed carbuncle in my corrupted blood but i will not chide thee let shame come when it will i do not call it i do not bid the thunderbearer shoot nor tell tales of thee to highjudging jove mend when thou can  be better at thy leisure i can be patient here poor lear seems to make some kind of amends for his former violence for though the provocation continues still the same nay rather indeed is increased by the repetition of it yet he contents himself in this place with barely upbraiding and reviling the offender but refrains from adding curses to his reproaches  human nature is equally discernible in both these instances the suddenness of his rage on the first injury might have wrested those anathemas from him involuntarily but before the second occasion presented itself his fury had had time to abate and he then restrains his speech within the bounds of a ustifiable resentment  act iii scene ii the fool here is a night that pities neither wise men nor fools   he must be very ignorant of human life who does not know that as the sun shines equally on the just and the unjust so sickness perils and afflictions are alike the casual portion of the good and bad the wise and foolish but then all this happens without the least manner of imputation upon providence  for this world is not a state of retribution  and in reality it would be a most uncomfortable reflection if it was for then we could have no reason to presume a fond and flattering hope upon a better  scene iii lear in the midst of thunder and lightning let the great gods that keep this dreadful pother over our heads find out their enemy now  tremble thou wretch that have within thee undivulged crimes unwhipt of justice hide thee thou bloody hand thou perjure and thou simular of virtue that art incestuous caitiff shake to pieces that under covert and convenient seeming hth practiced on mans life close pentup guilts rive your concealing continents and ask these dreadful summoners grace can there be a finer passage or a more admonitory one than this if upon all our dangers or calamities we should enter thus into a strict selfexamination of our consciences and conduct it might naturally produce a most salutary effect on our future lives as on such a scrutiny we should perhaps oftener find our misfortunes to be not our diseases but our medicines and from thence be brought to say with the psalmist happy has it been for me that i have been afflicted  in the same scene lear speaking to the fool who was appointed to show him the way to edgars hovel where he might be able to shelter himself from the storm says where is the straw my fellow the art of our necessities is strange that can make vile things precious   the truth of this observation is too obvious from experience to need being insisted on but i shall here add the remainder of the speech as it may be referred to and helps to justify the second paragraph of my remark on the tenth scene above in the former act  lear come your hovel  poor fool and knave i have one part in my heart that is sorry yet for thee  scene v when they have arrived near the hovel lear changes his purpose on account of a reason he afterward gives regarding the distracted state of his mind and being pressed by kent who just then joins him to take shelter from the outrage of the night he cries let me alone and being entreated a second time he repeats the same answer but upon being further urged by the kind earnestness of his poor servant which kent still preserves the appearance of he then exclaims with emotion wilt break my heart  how truly affecting is this short expostulation if quickly conceived it was not the importunity of kent that he meant to observe upon the expression needed not to have been so tender to have marked such an offense princes are apt to resent the controlement of their wills or actions in a severer style but it was the instantaneous comparison between the barbarity of his own daughters which had reduced him to such a wretched condition and the humanity of a common alien kindly pressing him to a shelter from it that so suddenly struck and affected his mind at that moment  this thought indeed might well be said to break his heart and to have added a single word more to explain this sentiment would have marred the whole beauty of the passage  upon kents still continuing his entreaty he still refuses to comply but reasons with him thus thou think it is much that this contentious storm invades us to the skin  so it is to thee  but where the greater malady is fixed the lesser is scarce felt  thou would shun a bear but if thy flight lay toward the roaring sea thou would meet the bear in the mouth when the minds free the bodys delicate  the tempest in my mind does from my senses take all feeling else save what beats there   this is the true nature of the human mind the greater evil always swallowing up the lesser as the rod of moses did the other serpents and in great calamities i do not know but it might perhaps be an advantage to have some other ills of an inferior nature to combat with at the same time for as lear says just after as his reason for refusing to take shelter this tempest will not give me leave to ponder on things would hurt me more   when he consents at last to enter the hut he presses his two attendants to go in first saying i will pray and then i will sleep  upon which he immediately falls into the following beautiful apostrophe you houseless poverty poor naked wretches wheresoeer you are that bide the pelting of this pitiless storm how shall your houseless heads and unfed sides your looped and windowed raggedness defend you from seasons such as these o i have taken too little care of this  take physic pomp expose thyself to feel what wretches feel that thou may shake the superux to them and show the heavens more just   here also i shall beg leave to refer the reader back to the second paragraph of my remark on the tenth scene of the second act  this puts me in mind of two good lines on the same subject which i met with in a very pretty little moral poem lately published by miss more of bristol   ask what we have to give  it is not ours heaven has but lent it us to make it yours scene ix edgar when we our betters see bearing our woes we scarcely think our miseries our foes who alone suffers suffers most in the mind leaving free things and happy shows behind states of life free from distress and likely to continue so  but then the mind much suffrance does oerskip when grief has mates and bearing fellowship how light and portable my pain seems now when that which makes me bend makes the king bow  he utters this reflection upon considering the comparative distresses to which lear had been reduced and his observation being drawn both from nature and the immediate object then before him has a double beauty and force in this place and should be remembered and applied in all such cases let us compare our own ills with those of others especially of persons who from their superior rank and fortune may be supposed to be better defended from injury than ourselves and it may conduce to render our minds often more acquiescent in our own sufferings  act iv scene i edgar yet better thus and known to be contemned than still contemned and flattered to be worst the lowest most dejected thing of fortune stands still in esperance lives not in fear  the lamentable change is from the best the worst returns to laughter  shakespeare gives us here a poetical paraphrase on the flattering old english proverb that when things are at the worst they will mend he has commenced the speech with a noble and liberal sentiment and concludes it with a reflection drawn from the adage in these lines world world o world but that thy strange mutations make us wait wait instead of hate  theobald thee life would not yield to age   that is if the vicissitudes of life did not suffer us to amuse our sufferings still with hope few would have patience enough to wait till old age should bring its slow relief to all our cares  enter gloucester blind and led by an old man old man you cannot see your way  gloucester i have no way and therefore want no eyes  i stumbled when i saw full often it is seen our maims maims instead of mean  johnson secure us and our mere defects prove our commodities  this is a truth often verified in life but the most general instances are that women and children are safer from harms than men are  they hazard less from being less able to achieve  gloucester as flies to wanton boys are we to the gods they kill us for their sport  this is a most impious and unphilosophic reflection poor gloucester seems by this expression to have been rather soured than softened by his misfortunes which his attempted suicide afterward proves still further such a sentiment must certainly surprise us in shakespeare when uttered by a person of so good a character as gloucester  it could not so offend in the mouth of edmund though better not spoken at all  gloucester when he has given his purse to the guide heavens deal so still let the superfluous superfluous for superabundant and lustdieted man that braves braves instead of slaves  warburton your ordinance that will not see because he does dot feel feel your power quickly so distribution should undo excess and each man have enough lear had before given us the same moral as taken notice of in my remark on the fifth scene of the former act but i have quoted this passage notwithstanding as containing a sentiment which cannot be too often inculcated offer it as a proposition and all the world will agree with you in the precept but make it a proposal and how few will join issue in the practice  scene ii albany and goneril when this good duke is reproaching his wife here for the barbarous treatment she had given her father she interrupts him with no more  it is foolish  to which he replies very justly wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile filths savor but themselves   it is indeed too much the horrid nature of vice and folly not only to rejoice in its own wickedness and weakness but as albany says to depreciate all wisdom and goodness in others the moor would have all faces black  he says further on in the same speech if that the heavens do not their visible spirits send quickly down to tame these vile offenses humanity must perforce prey on itself like monsters of the deep   this sentiment was as emphatically expressed before on the close of the last scene of the former act by two mean attendants who were witnesses to the cruelties exercised by cornwall and regan on glosters eyes but i forbore to quote it till i came to this passage  manent two servants first servant i will never care what wickedness i do if this man come to good  second servant if she live long and in the end meet the old course of death women will all turn monsters  but to return again to the scene with albany and goneril  she replies to his humane remonstrances and just reproaches in these words milklivered man that bear a cheek for blows a head for wrongs who have not in thy brows an eye discerning thine honor from thy suffering that not know fools do those villains pity who are punished ere they have done their mischief   on which albany exclaims see thyself devil proper deformity seems not in the fiend so horrid as in woman diabolical qualities appear not so horrid in the devil to whom they properly belong as in woman to whom they are unnatural warburton    what she means by the last lines is that it is necessary to guard against foreseen evils as well as to defend against those that press us but fools being too shortsighted to see the prevention in the punishment are apt to bewail the sufferer  scene iii kent and a gentleman the honest old kings friend having sent off this person with dispatches to cordelia then queen of france importing the miserable situation of her father questions him here on his return what kind of effect the perusal of his letter had upon her and nothing surely can be more beautiful nor more interesting than the description he gives of that fine struggle between patience and sorrow which she manifested upon this occasion with the delicacy and decency of her quick retiring from view when she found her grief beginning to master her philosophic seemings  kent did your letters pierce the queen to any demonstration of grief  gentleman ay sir she took them read them in my presence and now and then an ample tear trilled down her delicate cheek it seemed she was a queen over her passion which most rebellike sought to be king over her  kent o then it moved her   gentleman not to a rage patience and sorrow strove who should express her goodliest you have seen sun shine and rain at once  her smiles and tears were like a wetter may those happy smiles that played on her ripe lip seemed not to know what guests were in her eyes which parted thence as pearls from diamonds dropped  in brief sorrow would be a rarity most beloved if all could so become it part of the above description resembles what viola says in twelfthnight she sat like patience on a monument smiling at grief      kent made she no verbal question  gentleman yes once or twice she heaved the name of father pantingly forth as if it pressed her heart cried sisters sisters shame of ladies sisters kent father sisters what in the storm in the night let pity never believe it  there she shook the holy water from her heavenly eyes and clamourmotioned motioned instead of moistened warburton  then away she started to deal with grief alone  theobald hints that shakespeare had borrowed this fine picture of cordelias grief from joseph in holy writ who being no longer able to restrain his affections ordered his retinue from his presence and then wept aloud  scene vii the adulation and hyperbolical flattery which princes are too generally abused by is well exposed here lear they flattered me like a dog and told me i had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there  to say ay and no to every thing that i said  ay and no too was no good divinity  when the rain came to wet me once and the wind to make me chatter when the thunder would not peace at my bidding there i found them there i smelt them out go to they are not men of their words  they told me i was every thing it is a lie i am not agueproof     the great canute took a method of reproving the sycophants of his court who affected to treat him as a god by standing on the beach till the sea surrounded him notwithstanding his stern behest to the tide to arrest its course  scene viii a person here who has been witness to one of the scenes of lears madness makes this very natural reflection a sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch past speaking of in a king   strict philosophy perhaps may not admit of such a distinction in men merely from the difference of outward circumstances alone but the habits and opinions of the world will always operate both on our sentiments and feelings on a comparison to the full extent of the maxim here laid down  besides indeed without having the least manner of respect to persons that superior degree of calamity which can be capable of piercing through the stronger shields of station opulence and power before it can inflict its arrows upon princes must doubtless render them still greater objects of commiseration than those whose condition in life may be supposed to lie more open to the ordinary assails of misfortune see my remark upon the last scene of the former act  gloucester seems to have the same sense of things when in the following scene he expresses a surprise that because lear is disordered in his senses he should still be able to retain his own though indeed he makes but a sad deduction from the reflection  the king is mad how stiff is my vile sense that i stand up and have ingenious feeling of my huge sorrows better i were distract so should my thoughts be severed from my griefs and woes by wrong imagination lose the knowledge of themselves scene ix when edgar by killing of gonerils steward gets possession of the dispatches he was carrying to the enemy he takes a resolution to open them which he prefaces thus by your leave gentle wax and manners  blame us not  to know our enemies minds we rip their hearts  their papers are more lawful   but however certain reasons of state may possibly render such an action necessary there is something in it notwithstanding at which the liberal and ingenuous mind naturally revolts beyond the fixed and settled rules etc the comparison he makes indeed is certainly strong in favor of the lesser evil regarding merely the simple position of the question but then he should have restrained himself to the saying the latter was more reasonable or humane than have pronounced it to be more lawful for it is this very circumstance the legality of the former act which marks the difference between them and which though severe yet being founded on the maxims of the civillaw that no person shall be convict of a crime without his own confession shaftesbury makes ridicule and the civil law as wisely makes torture the est of truth  appears to be more justifiable in the constitution of things than even a milder act which has no such principle to support it nay which rather militates as in this case it apparently does against that very maxim by obtaining a surreptitious proof of guilt without confession besides the compassing it by an ungenerous baseness  scene x the following speech is replete with filial tenderness as well as excess if that can possibly be of humanity  cordelia speaking to her father while he sleeps had you not been their father that is had you been even an alien or a stranger  these white flakes did challenge pity of them was this a face to be exposed against the warring winds to stand against the deep dreadbolted thunder in the most terrible and nimble stroke of quick cross lightning to watch poor perdu with this thin helm my very enemys dog though he had bit me should have stood that night against my fire and wast thou fain poor father to hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn in short and musty straw alack alack it is wonder that thy life and wits at once had not concluded act v scene i there is a noble and a just maxim delivered in the following speech though not indeed very consonant with the profligate notions of ancient barbarism commonly called heroism  albany to edmund sir this i hear the king is come to his daughter to cordelia  with other whom the rigor of our state forced to cry out where i could not be honest i never yet was valiant scene v when lear and cordelia are brought in prisoners the latter asks if they may not be permitted to a conference with these daughters and these sisters in hopes of working on their compassion to set them free  to which lear answers with that mixture of extravagance and sound sense which so obviously run through the whole of his delirium no no no no come let us away to prison we two alone will sing like birds in the cage when thou do ask me blessing i will kneel down and ask of thee forgiveness so well live and pray and sing and tell old tales and laugh at gilded butterflies and hear poor rogues talk of court news and well talk with them too who loses and who wins who is in who is out and take upons the mystery of things as if we were gods spies and well wear out in a walled prison packs and sets sets instead of sects johnson of great ones that ebb and flow by the moon   in the above speech besides the wildness of the first part which is however extremely affecting for passion moves us more than reason there is here as in all this poor kings rhapsodies as hinted before a document in madness which excellently describes the character of the old quid nuncs so well ridiculed in the spectator indeed of the coffeehouse politicians of all times and which well rebukes the idle presumption of those vain ignorants who pretend to canvass the mysteries of state and investigate the arcana of government as if they were of a superior order of intelligence without any knowledge in the science of civil polity or the least capacity for the arts of empire  such intermeddlers by working themselves in to be the demagogues of the populace have often perplexed councils and sometimes overthrown kingdoms for as it is the few who govern in all states their strength must necessarly be founded more in authority than force and when once rule or royalty have been rendered the objects of general diffidence or contempt what curb is there left to restrain the many  slaves and fools then pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench and minister in their steads timon scene vi a respect for regality supported by a just claim is ever so strongly impressed in the general bosom of a people that rebels never think they can sufficiently secure themselves against it from whence the common saying that princes seldom remove from a prison but to a grave this thought is well expressed in the following speech edmund to albany who commands him to deliver up his prisoners sir i thought it fit to send the old and miserable king to some retention and appointed guard whose age has charms in it whose title more to pluck the common bosoms on his side and turn our impressed lances in our eyes which do command them   scene viii after edgar has wounded and vanquished edmund he makes the following reflection the gods are just and of our several i have ventured to make a slight alteration here because the word pleasant in the text had no relation to the speech as far as i have quoted it besides that the expression i have substituted renders the maxim more general vices make instruments to scourge us   there have been such frequent instances in life of the above observation that those vices which we have most indulged ourselves in have become the peculiar means of our chastisement that it might naturally lead us into a belief that this may possibl be one among the many secret ways of providence with its creatures  at least the adaptions have often been so very extraordinary and remarkable that it might tempt one to suppose there must have been something more than the common casualty or contingency of events in such cases i could wish however for the sake of morals to encourage the persuasion and render it universal  albany edgar and edmund edgar giving an account of his last interview with his father never o fault revealed myself to him until some half hour past when i was armed not sure though hoping of this good success i asked his blessing and from first to last told him my pilgrimage but his flawed heart alack too weak the conflict to support twixt two extremes of passion joy and grief burst smilingly edmund speak you on you look as you had something more to say  albany if there be more more woeful hold it in for i am almost ready to dissolve hearing of this  edgar this would have seemed a period but such as love to amplify anothers sorrow to much would add much more and top extremity the t has been altered here by doctor warburton much to the advantage of its ense and perspicuity   the difference of natures between albany a man of virtue and consequently of a compassionate disposition and edmund a vicious person and of course of blunted feelings is well marked in the above dialogue the latter would have the sad story continued but the former entreated to hear no more of it and edgar has well observed upon these opposed characters in the preface he makes to the second part of his tale  this would have seemed a period etc scene ix the same albany however immediately after upon seeing the dead bodies of goneril and regan brought in says this judgment of the heavens that makes us tremble touches us not with pity   here a hasty reader might be apt to think that the good duke had forfeited his character for hmanity a little in this instance but there is something inimitably just and fine in the passage we certainly feel ourselves differently affected toward the wretched in the common lot of life and those who seem to be distinguished as the more immediate objects of divine chastisement our minds in the latter case become impressed with a sort of pious awe which restrains our compassion lest the too free indulgence of it might seem to arraign the justice of providence  this is a trait of human nature so very little obvious to common capacities that though all must have been sensible of the feeling so few have had penetration enough to investigate the cause that i dare say many have been ashamed to confess it as imputing it to a deficiency of tenderness in their own hearts  scene x this play concludes with the following most excellent moral albany all friends shall taste the wages of their virtue and all foes the cup of their deservings    it were a consummation devoutly to be wished that the examples of this precept were more numerous in the world than they are  it is a peculiar reproach to the character which utters it when they are not albany was a king see my last reflection upon

when we for recompense have praised the vile it stains the glory in that happy verse which amply sings the good  this remark is extremely just that the flattery which parasites or needy clients are

sacrificial whisperings offer up their prayers and vow gifts to his altar as  was a god shakespeare says in anthony and cleopatra of the queens women they made ther beds adorings in his ear make sacred even his stirrup and through him drink the free air seem only to live upon his breath  when fortune in her shift and change of mood spurns down her late beloved all his dependants which labored after to the mountains top even on their knees and hands let him slip down not one accompanying his declining foot  painter it is common a thousand moral paintings i can show that shall demonstrate these quick blows of fortune more pregnantly than words  yet you do well to show lord timon that mean eyes have seen the foot above the head  the first speech in the above dialogue well describes the general and truly moral satire and properly distinguishes it from the bastard or invidious kind of personal invective styled the libel or lampoon my free drift halts not particularly etc   scene ii timon upon hearing of his friend ventidius being thrown into a gaol says to the messenger commend me to him i will send his ransom and being enfranchised bid him come to me it is not enough to help the feeble up but to support him after   the last lines contain a noble sentiment of friendship charity and generosity  it has merit enough in itself to stand alone but would have double the effect on an hearer if pronounced by a person of a more prudent and provident character  this thought is beautifully expressed in an old elegy written on the good bishop boulter who died primate of ireland some years ago  he thought it mean only to help the poor to beg again   timon says soon after in the same dialogue this gentleman of mine has served me long to build his fortune i will strain a little for it is a bond in men   and again in scene v for i choose to collect like sentiments under the same head he says to ventidius who comes to thank him for his friendship and to repay the debt you mistake my love i gave it freely ever and there is none can truly say he gives if he receives   but to return to our former scene  when timon asks the old athenian whether his daughter likes the young man that courts her he replies she is young and apt  our own precedent passions do instruct us what levitys in youth   this is a sensible and philosophic reflection and should be more attended to than it generally is for there are no persons fit to educate to guide or instruct young people but those who have not forgotten their own youth parents and grandparents are apt too often to require their children and grandchildren should benefit of their earned knowledge and long experience and so go on from thence improving still in sense and virtue it would be a happy thing indeed if we could put morals on the foot of science which is thus progressive but they must be very ignorant of human nature who expect it  old folks as an ingenious modern author expresses it would have young ones as wise as themselves without considering that they must be fools if they were so the friends or original letters vol ii letter lxxix  meaning for he does not stay to explain himself that they must be persons of dull phlegmatic natures without passions without sensibility and consequently incapable of improvement or virtue  whenever i have happened to observe what are called the virtues of age to be innate in youth i have naturally expected to meet with the vices of it there also and have but rarely found any one of such character uninfected with selfishness or avarice  when timon receives a portrait from the painter he makes a satirical reflection upon it which though too just in itself seems to be a good deal out of character in him at that time as being previous to the experience which soon after might have instructed him to have made it  the painting is almost the natural man for since dishonor trafficks with mans nature he is but outside penciled figures are even such as they give out scene iii apemantus on seeing and hearing much embracing and professing between timon and alcibiades mutters thus to himself that there should be small love amongst these sweet knaves and all this courtesy the strain of man is bred out into baboon and monkey  stern said of french politeness that it might be compared to a smooth coin it had lost all mark of character to which i think we may add that courtesy like counters by having attained a currency in the world have come at length to bear an equal rate we might say a superior one with pieces of intrinsic value so that one who should make a difference between them in the modern traffic of life would be looked upon as a mere virtuoso who preferred an otho to a georgius  we must take up with the world at present as we do with the stage to which it has so often been compared there is a fable in both and if the actors but perform their personated characters well we are not to quarrel with them for not exhibiting their natural ones  scene v the noble timon being rendered uneasy at the too servile deferences paid him by his clients justly says nay ceremony was but devised at first to set a gloss on faint deeds hollow welcomes recanting goodness sorry ere it is shown but where there is true friendship there needs none   there is a parallel thought in the merchant of venice taken notice of before in my last remark on that play  further on in this scene there occurs a passage which well deserves to be quoted but needs no note  timon lucius and others lucius might we but have the happiness my lord that you would once use our hearts whereby we might express some part of our zeals we should think ourselves for ever perfect that is arrived at the perfection of happiness    timon o no doubt my good friends but the gods themselves have provided that i should have much help from you how had you been my friends else why have you that charitable title from thousands did i not chiefly belong to your hearts the sense of this passage in the original text is made clearer by an alteration of doctor johnsons  i have told more of you to myself than you can with modesty speak in your own behalf and thus far i confirm you oh ye gods think i what need we have any friends if we should never have need of them they would most resemble sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their sounds to themselves why i have often wished myself poorer that i might come nearer to you we are born to do benefits and what better or properer can we call our own than the riches of our friends o what a precious comfort it is to have so many like brothers commanding one anothers fortunes o joy even made away ere t can be born mine eyes cannot hold water   scene vii apemantus oh that mens ears should be to counsel deaf but not to flattery  it is indeed an unhappy reflection to think how few examples there are in life to controvert this maxim if the first were not the case there would be no such thing as the latter for men would then deserve the praise they get  act ii scene i the following speech may serve to hint a common truth that all gifts or presents from inferiors may be considered but as petitions to their superiors  senator if i want gold steal but a beggars dog and give it timon why the dog coins gold if i would sell my horse and buy ten more better than he why give my horse to timon ask nothing give it him it foals me straight ten able horse  scene iv the honest and anxious steward of timon makes a reflection here which the experience of all times has too fully vouched  flavius heavens have i said the bounty of this lord how many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants this night englutted who now is not timons what heart head sword force means but is lord timons great timons noble worthy royal timons ah when the means are gone that buy this praise the breath is gone whereof this praise is made feastwon feastlost one cloud of winter showers these flies are couched couched smothered   scene v when the reduced and unhappy timon finds himself involved in poverty and distress he directs his steward to call upon the body of the senators who had shared his bounties for its assistance in this exigence in answer to which the steward acquaints him that he had taken the liberty to do this already upon his own prior knowledge in the situation of his affairs the account he then proceeds to give of the reception his application had met with among these shadows of friendship is such i am sorry to say as those who have ever been under a necessity of making the same experiment will readily acknowledge to be genuine faint expressions of good will with a strong reproof for extravagances which they themselves had both encouraged and partaken of and finally closed with an absolute denial of relief  flavius they answer in a joint and corporate voice that now they are at fall want treasure cannot do what they would are sorry  you are honorable  but yet they could have wished  they know not  something has been amiss  a noble nature may catch a wrench  would all were well  it is pity  and so intending intending for attending to other serious matters after distasteful looks and these hard fractions fractions of speech as you are honorable  they could have wished  it is pity etc  with certain halfcaps and coldmoving nods they froze me into silence  to which timon replies with a competent knowledge of human nature for he seems to be inspired here as before see the last passage of scene ii of the former act with the remark upon it  these old fellows have their ingratitude in them hereditary by hereditary he means naturally or connate with old age  their blood is caked is cold it seldom flows it is lack of friendly warmth they are not kind and nature as it grows again towered earth is fashioned for the journey dull and heavy   after having thrown out this stricture against age and avarice he desires his steward to apply to ventidius a young man lately come into the possession of a large fortune whom he had just redeemed from the miseries of a gaol and restrains him only to borrow from him the exact sum he had before paid for his release saying never speak or think that timons fortunes among his friends can sink   to which the more experienced steward replies to himself would i could not that thought is bountys foe being free itself it thinks all others so   the same sentiment is well expressed by zanga in the description he gives of his conqueror is not alonzo rather brave than cautious honest than subtle above fraud himself slow therefore to suspect it in another the revenge  act iii scene i when ventidius has declined to lend his assistance though this circumstance is only hinted at but not produced upon the scene timon dispatches the steward in the text this persons name is flaminius but i have not here distinguished him from flavius to avoid a confusion of persons under the same character of steward to lucullus another young man of promising hopes who answers in the same strain with the evasive and sarcastical reply given before by the senators as related in the fifth scene of the preceding act pleading incapacity and reprehending the too profuse liberality of timon after which he forces some pieces into flaviuss hand by way of bribing him to pretend to his master that he had not met with him and then goes off upon which the honest and indignant steward flinging away the money cries out may these add to the number that may scald thee let molten coin be thy damnation thou disease of a friend and not himself has friendship such a faint and milky heart it turns turns  alluding to milks growing sour in less than two nights o ye gods i feel my masters passion this slave unto this hour has my lords meat in him why should it thrive and turn to nutriment when he is turned himself to poison o may diseases only work upon it and when he is sick to death let not that part of nurture my lord paid for be of power to expel sickness but prolong his hour   the generous and feeling mind must naturally sympathize with the warmth of resentment here expressed though its moral and charity may refrain it from concurring in the anathemas of it  i cannot quit this scene till i have remarked upon the character of ventidius as represented by two seeming contradictory circumstances in the first and second acts  in the former he shows his honesty and gratitude to his benefactor by offering to repay the money which had been given to redeem his liberty scene v of the play but only hinted at here in one of the excursions from scene ii by way of introducing timons fine reply to the offer  and here he betrays the very reverse of these principles is shakespeare inconsistent no it is nature still ventidius had just then succeeded to an ample patrimony a sudden afflux of fortune especially to a person newly emerging from distress is apt to swell and enlarge the heart at first but then in mean minds it is as apt to shrink and contract it as suddenly again  scene ii enter lucius and three strangers that disingenuous nature in mankind which prompts to censure those vices in others which themselves are capable of is well exposed here  when the first stranger has mentioned the forlorn state of timons fortunes and related the story of luculluss unkindness toward him lucius exclaims with surprise what a strange case was that now before the gods i am ashamed on it denied that honorable man there was very little honor shown in that for my own part i must needs confess i have received some small kindnesses from him as money plate jewels and such like trifles nothing comparing to his yet had he not mistook him and sent to me the sense is corrected here by doctor johnsons alteration of the text in a note  i should never have denied his occasions so many talents but immediately after in the same scene upon application made to himself by servilius to the same purpose he thus defends his purse what a wicked wicked for unlucky beast was i speaking to the messenger to disfurnish myself against so good a time when i might have shown myself honorable how unluckily it happened that i should purchase the day before for a little dirt dirt instead of part theobald  and undo a great deal of honor servilius now before the gods i am not able to do  the more beast i say  i was sending to use lord timon myself these gentlemen can witness but i would not for the wealth of athens i had done it now commend me bountifully to his good lordship and i hope his honor will conceive the fairest of me because i have no power to be kind and tell him this from me i count it one of my greatest afflictions that i cannot pleasure such an honorable gentleman good servilius will you befriend me so far as to use my own words to him then turning to the first stranger he says what is too generally experienced through life true as you said timon is shrunk indeed and he that is once denied will hardly speed   upon lucius and serviliuss going out the following dialogue is held between the remaining persons in which some scandalum magnatums are thrown out against the dignity of human nature  first stranger do you observe this hostilius  second stranger ay too well  first stranger why this is the worlds soul and just of the same piece is every flatterers spirit who can call him his friend that dips in the same dish for in my knowing timon has been this lords father and kept his credit with his purse supported his estate nay timons money has paid his men their wages he never drinks but timons silver treads upon his lip  and yet oh see the monstrousness of man when he looks out in an ungrateful shape he does deny him in respect of his in respect of his of luciuss fortune  what charitable men afford to beggars  third stranger religion groans at it  first stranger for mine own part i never tasted timon in my life nor any of his bounties came over me to mark me for his friend yet i protest for his right noble mind illustrious virtue and honorable carriage had his necessity made use of me i would have put my wealth into partition partition substituted for donation hanmer  and the best half should have attorned attorned instead of returned  warburton to him so much i love his heart  but i perceive men now must learn with pity to dispense for policy poliy for selfishness sits above conscience  this latter speech savours too much of the former one of lucius and as the queen says in hamlet the gentleman does profess too much but we shall charitably accept it as sincere since the speakers virtue has not been put to the proof  scene iii sempronius another of timons friends is here assailed who evades the request by pleading surprise that he should be the first person applied to on such an exigence before lucius lucullus and ventidius who had each of them so much higher obligations to his services than himself but being beaten out of that argument by being informed of their all having been before touched and found base metal as the messenger tells him he then makes use of a device not uncommon in such cases to pretend a quarrel or affect a jealousy with a person in order to have ones resentment pass as an excuse for refusing the favor required  sempronius how denied him ventidius lucullus lucius all denied him and does he send to me three hum  it shows but little love or judgment in him ust i be his last refuge his friends like physicians thrice thrice instead of thrive johnson give him over  must i take the cure upon me h has much disgraced me in it  i am angry at him  he might have known my place i see no sense for it but his occasions might have wooed me first for in my conscience i was the first man that ever received gift from him and does he think so backwardly of me that i will requite it last no  so it may prove an argument of laughter to the rest and i amongst lords be thought a fool i would rather than the worth of thrice the sum he had sent to me first but for my minds sake i would such a courage courage for heart or good will then to do him good  but now return  and with their faint reply this answer join who bates mine honor shall not know my coin  when sempronius retires the servant who had brought the message to him makes some reflections which with many other instances of the same kind in these writings show that shakespeare was as prodigal of his wit and sentiment as timon was of his favor and fortune for he often squanders them both upon clowns and lacqueys  servant excellent your lordships a goodly villain the devil knew what he did when he made man politic politic again for selfish see note last but two  he crossed crossed for blessed himself in the romish sense of the word himself by it and i cannot think but that in the end the villainies of man will set him clear set him clear  leave him no longer chargeable with the crime of tempting them  how fairly this lord strives to appear foul takes virtuous copies to be wicked by pretending a pique of honor and a generous resentment at not having been first applied to  like those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire alluding to religious wars   of such a nature is his politic politic encore in the same sense love  this was my lords best hope now all are fled save the gods only i have transposed these words for the sake of the measure in the text they stand thus save only the gods   scene iv another sentimental footman sent by one of timons creditors to press him for his debt speaks the following couplet the last line of which deserves to be made an adage of i know my lord has spent of timons wealt and now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth   scene vi alcibiades pleading before the senate for the life of a friend who had killed his antagonist in a fair rencounter thus addresses himself to the court health honor and compassion to the senate i am an humble suitor to your virtues for pity is the virtue of the law and none but tyrants use it cruelly   our author is always most remarkably strong in his expression and rich in his argument upon the subject of this divine attribute of mercy witness portias speech in the merchant of venice isabellas in measure for measure and several other passages of the same kind throughout his writings to make pity the virtue of the law is a fine idea and a beautiful expression  the argument for and against the practice of duelling is here very philosophically urged on one side and as artfully evaded on the other  snator you undergo undergo for undertake too strict a paradox striving to make an ugly deed look fair your words have took such pains as if they labored to bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling upon the head of valor which indeed is valor misbegot and came into the world when sects and factions were but newly born he is truly valiant that can wisely suffer the worst that man can breathe and make his wrongs his outsides wear them like his raiment carelessly and never prefer his injuries to his heart to bring it into danger if wrongs be evils and enforce us kill what folly it is to hazard life for ill  alcibiades my lord   senator you cannot make gross sins look clear it is not valor to revenge but bear  alcibiades my lords then under favor pardon me i i speak like a captain why do end men expose themselves to battle and not endure all threatenings sleep upon it and let the foes quietly cut their throats without repugnancy but if there be such valor in the bearing what make we abroad why then sure women are more valiant that stay at home if bearing carry it then is the ass more captain than the lion and the felon laden with irons wiser than the judge if wisdom be in suffering the text has been much improved in this latter part by doctor johnson   i shall submit this difficult punctilio of honor duelling to the decision of my male readers for as a woman i cannot be supposed to be a competent judge of it however i shall venture to proceed so far as to observe that as this piece of ancient chivalry is said to have been originally instituted for our defense i must confess i think it should have rested there  alcibiades then concludes the above speech by petitioning again for mercy oh my lords as you are great be pitifully good who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood to kill i grant is sins extremest gust but in defense by mercy it is most just to be in anger is impiety but who is man that is not angry weigh but the crime with this   scene vii when timon meets his late delinquent friends at the mock banquet he had prepared and pressed them to he makes a just sarcasm as well as a justly provoked one upon the insincerity of their professions  senator the swallow follows not summer more willingly than we your lordship   timon aside nor more willingly leaves winter  such summerbirds are men   he again carries on the same strain in the first part of the grace he pronounces before the covers are taken off  timon the gods require our thanks   you great benefactors sprinkle our society with thankfulness for your own gifts make yourselves praised but reserve still to give lest your deities be despised lend to each man enough that one need not lend to another for were your godheads to borrow of men men would forsake the gods   when the dishes are exposed filled only with warm water he thus expresses his resentment in just description and apt epithets for such guests  may you a better feast never behold you knot of mouthfriends smoke and lukewarm water is your perfection that is your perfect resemblance  this is timons last who stuck and spangled you with flatteries flatteries for bounties or favors  washes it off and sprinkles in your faces your reeking villainy live loathed and long most smiling smooth detested parasites courteous destroyers affable wolves meek bears you fools of fortune trencherfriends timeflies summer insects  cap and knee slaves vapors and minutejacks machines of motion which require frequent winding up or a phrase framed for timeservers  act iv scene ii in this scene another of timons servants or rather one of shakespeares see my note following semproniuss speech in scene iii of the foregoing act  delivers himself most affectionately and affectingly upon the unhappy condition of his master  as we do turn our backs from our companion thrown into his grave so his familiars from his buried fortunes slink all away leave their false vows with him like empty purses picked and his poor self a dedicated beggar to the air with his disease of allshunned poverty walks like contempt alone scene iii there are so many unfavourable pictures of the world already given by shakespeare that though each of them may be very proper in its respective place to adorn the fable and maintain the characters in the several dramas yet some of them it may be thought might be spared in a work of this general kind which requires not such minute attentions but as my scope here is not only to instruct the ignorant to warn the unwary and inculcate the moral of our author both from his precepts and examples but to do him honor also as a writer i think it would be a sort of injustice in me to suffer any passage in him to remain unnoted which besides conducing to such great ends may serve to show the fecundity of his powers and genius which has enabled him to treat the same subject in so many different ways with still new thoughts and varied expression  the following speech is a beautiful instance of this observation  timon twinned brothers of one womb whose procreation residence and birth scarce is dividant touch with several fortunes the greater scorns the lesser not even nature to whom all sores lay siege can bear great fortune but by contempt of nature this sentence is obscure it means that men though conscious of the imperfection of human nature when puffed up by fortune will despise others for their common imperfections as if they were themselves exempt from them  raise me this beggar and denude denude strip or deprive him of his possessions that lord the senator shall bear contempt hereditary he uses the word hereditary here with the same latitude he has done before see note  th on scene v of second act in this place it means that contempt is the usual portion or patrimony of poverty  the beggar native native is used in the same sense with hereditary as above explained honor it is the pasture lards the wethers sides the want that makes him lean the text has been cleared of its difficulty and much improved in its sense in this passage by doctor warburton  who dares who dares in purity of manhood stand upright and say this mans a flatterer if one be so are they all for every greeze greeze step or degree of fortune is smoothed by that below the learned pate ducks to the golden fool all is oblique there is nothing level in our cursed natures but direct villainy  in the sixth scene following he exclaims against the world again but myself who had the world as my confectionary the mouths the tongues the eyes the hearts of men at duty more than i could frame employments that numberless upon me stuck as leaves do on the oak have with one winters brush fallen from their boughs and left me open bare for every storm that blows   but to return at the end of the former speech upon finding gold while he was digging for roots he says thus much of this will make black white fair foul wrong right base noble old young coward valiant you gods why this  this you gods why this will lug your priests and votaries from your sides pluck stout mens pillows from beneath their heads kill them before their time for the sake of their wealth  this yellow slave will knit and break religions bless the accursed make the hoar leprosy adored place thieves and give them title knee and approbation with senators on the bench this is it that makes the mourning the word in the text is wappened but the commentators not agreeing about the sense of the expression i have ventured to substitute one that needs no explanation widow wed again come damned earth thou common whore of mankind that puttst odds among the rout of nations i will make thee do thy right nature lie hid in the bowels of the earth where kind providence meant to conceal thee  burying it   and again in the sixth scene of this act looking on the gold he renews the same reflections  o thou sweet kingkiller and dear divorce twixt natural son this adjective is meant in the liberal sense of the word not the legal one and sire thou bright defiler of hymens purest bed thou valiant mars thou ever young fresh loved and delicate wooer whose blush does thaw the consecrated snow that lies on dians lap what a beautiful and poetical passage is here both in the imagery and the expression  thou visible god that solderest close impossibilities and make them kiss that speak with every tongue to every purpose o thou touch of hearts think thy slave man rebels and by thy virtue set them into confounding odds that beasts may have the world in empire i have suffered these last lines to pass as they seem as well to continue the enumeration of the fatal effects of avarice as to denounce a curse against it  scene iv when alcibiades meets with timon wild in the woods he asks with concern and surprise how came the noble timon to this change to which he severely replies but in shakespeares usual sport of fancy even on the most serious subjects as the moon does by wanting light to give but then renew i could not like the moon there were no suns to borrow of alcibiades i have heard in some sort of thy miseries  timon thou saw them when i had prosperity    and in the next scene in an invocation to the earth he says dry up thy marrows vines and ploughtorn leas whereof ungrateful man with lickerish draughts and morsels unctuous greases his pure mind that from it all consideration slips   scene vi here also are some more strictures thrown out contra mundum with which i shall conclude this act  timon and apemantus apemantus what man did thou ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means   timon who without those means thou talk of did thou ever know beloved   act v scene i flavius the good steward upon seeing his master sitting before the mouth of his cave makes the following fond and pathetic exclamation succeeded by reflections in the same style with those which mostly fill this play oh ye gods is yon despised and ruinous man my lord full of decay and failing oh monument and wonder of good deeds evilly bestowed what change of honor desperate want has made what viler thing upon the earth than friends who can bring noblest minds to basest ends how rarely rarely for fitly does it meet with this times guise when man was wished to love his enemies grant i may ever love and rather woo those that would mischief me than those that do this passage is difficult doctor warburton has altered the text to accommodate it to his explanation and doctor johnson has restored it the meaning of it as it here stands is that open enemies are less dangerous than false friends we can shield ourselves from the ne but are prisoners at discretion with the other mr jhnson quotes a spanish proverb to the same effect defend me from my friends and from my enemi i will defend myself    scene ii here also in the same strain our author proceeds when two of timons former sycophants upon hearing that their patron is suddenly become rich again are going together to cajole him as before they hold the following dialogue with each other  poet and painter poet what have you now to present unto him   painter nothing at this time but my visitation only i will promise him an excellent piece   poet i must serve him so too tell him of an intent that is coming toward him   painter good as the best promising is the very air of the time it opens the eyes of expectation performance is ever the duller for his act and but in the plainer and simpler kind of people the deed is quite out of use to promise is most courtly and fashionable performance is a kind of will or testament which argues a great sickness in his judgment that makes it   poet i am thinking what i shall say i have provided for him it must be a personating personating  of his own situation and circumstances of himself a satire against the softness of prosperity with a discovery of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency nay let us seek him then do we sin against our own estate when we may profit meet and come too late    painter true while the day serves before blackcornered night find what thou want by free and offered light  timon overhearing their conversation from behind his cave casts out another invective against gold and concludes his speech with an expression which i have also let pass for the reason beforementioned in the last note on scene iii of the former act for though used in the form of a curse it may however be hardly considered in that light as it is but the natural consequence of the vice and is no more than to say may the man who swallows poison die which he certainly will do  timon what a gods gold that he is worshipped in baser temples than where swine do feed it is thou that riggst the bark and ploughst the foam settlest admired reverence in a slave to thee be worship and thy saints for aye be crowned with plagues that thee alone obey  i shall here conclude my remarks upon this play with dr johnsons character of it as far as the fable has any relation to moral  the catastrophe says he affords a very powerful warning against that ostentatious liberality which scatters bounty but confers no benefit and buys flattery but not friendship  titus andronicus dramatis personae men titus andronicus a noble roman general against the goths marcus andronicus his brother and a tribune of the people bassianus second son of the late emperor women tamora queen of the goths a captive titus andronicus it has been much disputed among the commentators whether this play be originally shakespeares or only the work of some elder author revised and improved for representation by him though if i might be allowed to venture a criticism upon this subject i should suppose the entire piece to be his and for a very singular reason because the whole of the fable as well as the conduct of it is so very barbarous in every sense of the word that i think however he might have been tempted to make use of the legend in some hurry or other for his own purpose he could hardly have adopted it from any other persons composition we are quicksighted to the faults of others though purblind to our own besides he would never have strewed such sweet flowers upon a caput mortuum if some child of his had not lain entombed underneath many of the beauties i hint at being merely poetical imagery without any mixture of moral in them are therefore not inserted among the following notes as not being the proper object of my remarks which must in consequence appear to fall short of the above compliment  the arguments pro and con for the authenticity of this play are not material to our present purpose for as we find it among the musterroll of our authors forces it challenges a right to pass in review along with the rest though there are but very few passages in it to answer the design of this work  i should imagine from the many shocking spectacles exhibited in this play that it could never have been represented on any theater except the lisbon scaffold where the duke daveiro the marquis of tavora cum suis were so barbarously massacred for the supposed jesuits plot against the present king of portugal and yet ben johnson assures us that it was performed in his time with great applause and we are also told that it was revived again in the reign of charles the second with the same success the different humors and tastes of times it would be not only hissed but driven off the stage at present  act i scene ii tamora queen of the goths and a captive pleading here to titus andronicus for her sons life who was going to be offered up as a victim of war speaks in shakespeares usual style as remarked before see timon act iii scene vi the first remark  on the great article of mercy  would thou draw near the nature of the gods draw near them in being merciful  sweet mercy is nobilitys true badge there is something so soothing to the mind in a description of the sequestered scene free from the tumult the vices and the violences of the world that it naturally pleases us even though the grave itself be made the subject of it  i affirm that i was sensible of such a feeling myself on reading the following passage in this scene though without the least manner of disgust to life all the while  titus andronicus on the interment of his sons in peace and honor rest you here my sons romes readiest champions repose you here secure from worldly chances and mishaps  here lurks no treason here no envy swells here grow no damned grudges here no storms no noise but silence and eternal sleep scene iii when bassianus applies to titus for his interest in support of his election to the roman empire he says my faction this innocent word is not to be understood here in the common acceptance of it shakespeare uses it simply to denote any party in a state if thou strengthen with thy friends i will most thankful be  and thanks to men of noble minds is honorable meed   there is something truly great in the above sentiment and shows the speaker of it worthy of being an emperor a grateful heart is all that heaven itself requires for its numerous blessings and mercies toward us  act iii scene iv marcus andronicus endeavoring to repress his brother tituss excess of grief who was laboring under the most unheard of cruelties and misery both in himself and his children addresses him thus oh brother speak with possibilities and do not break into these deep extremes to which titus replies is not my sorrow deep having no bottom then be my passions bottomless with them marcus but yet let reason govern thy lament  titus if there were reason for these miseries then into limits could i bind my woes when heaven does weep does not the earth oerflow if the winds rage does not the sea wax mad threatening the welkin with his bigswoln face and will thou have a reason for this coil then give me leave for losers will have leave to ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues    titus in this speech says a great deal to excuse the shows and expressions of grief though in too poetical a style rather for so sad a subject but i think the first argument of it a very strong one upon this occasion  if there were reason for these miseries etc for we certainly suffer those misfortunes which happen to our lot in the common course of nature or of justice with much more resignation of mind than we can do those which are inflicted on us by the violences of tyranny cruelty or malice  here our detestation and abhorrence of the agent serves to heighten our resentment of the injury  in the two last lines above shakespeare has given an elevation to the common expression of losers have leave to speak there are instances of the same kind in our author before taken notice of this is one of his characteristics and indeed i think that his style and manner are so strongly marked throughout this play take the above speech for one instance the whole of it for i have transcribed it short  that i own it surprises me doctor johnson should say he did not think shakespeares touches discernible in it  in the same scene when some shocking objects of his wretchedness are presented to the view of titus he makes a very natural reflection upon them for a person in such unhappy circumstances  ah that this sight should make so deep a wound and yet detested life not shrink thereat that ever death should let life bear his name where life has no more interest than to breathe in the extremities of anguish either of mind or body we are apt to be surprised at that toughness in our frame which prevents its dissolution and are often tempted to wish our miseries might of themselves have sufficient force to bring us that relief which our virtue or religion forbids us to supply ourselves  macbeth dramatis personae men macbeth duncan macduff banquo malcolm rosse cathness angus doctor old man women lady macbeth lady macduff macbeth act i scene v anquo but it is strange and oftentimes to win us to our harm the instruments of darkness tell us truths win us with honest trifles to betray us in deepest consequence  from this speech may be deduced the nature of temptation to evil which by suggesting some immediate pleasure or profit prompts us on to unhappy consequences  scene vi the following description of the death of a brave man after he has made a peace with his conscience by contrition is a fine one  malcolm speaking to the king of the execution of the thane of cawdor very frankly he confessed his treasons implored your highness pardon and set forth a deep repentance  nothing in his life became him like the leaving it he died as one that had been studied who had frequently philosophised upon it in his death to throw away the dearest thing he owed owed for owned  as twere a careless trifle the bravery of spirit which so many persons both ancient and modern have manifested in this great and last article of their lives seems to argue something more in human nature than mere animal existence  the specious appearances of men by which the ingenuous and unwary are liable to be deceived in their commerce with the world are marked and lamented by duncan in this scene where speaking of the abovementioned rebel he says there is no art to find the minds construction natural disposition in the face  he was a gentleman on whom i built an absolute trust   momus well wished a window in every mans breast physiognomists pretend they can take a peep through the features of the face but this is too abstruse a science to answer the general purposes of life besides that education may render such knowledge doubtful as in the case of socrates the diseases or unsoundness of the body are generally visible in the countenance and complexion of the invalid how infinitely more useful would it be if the vices of the mind were as obvious there it is not necessary in the first case because the patient can tell his disorder but in the other instance the infected person is dumb o heaven that such resemblance of the highest should yet remain where faith and realty remain not milton see the last remark upon twelfth night  scene ix macbeth in his meditations on the murder of duncan has some fine and just reflections on the nature of conscience  if it were done when it is done then twere well it were done quickly  if the assassination could trammel up the consequence and catch with its success surcease success surcease these two words were reversed in the original but proprly transposed by theobald  that but this blow might be the beall and the endall  here but here upon this bank and shoal of time wed jump the life to come  but in these cases we still have judgment here that we but teach bloody instructions which being taught return to plague the inventor this evenhanded justice commends commends for returns the ingredients of our poisoned chalice to our own lips scene x and in this scene when lady macbeth upbraids her husband with cowardice for not being more determined on the purpose of the murder he makes the following noble reflection prithee peace  i dare do all that may become a man  who dares do more is none   doctor johnson very justly says that these lines ought to bestow immortality on the author though all his other productions had been lost  act ii scene ii again  the horrors of a guilty mind are strongly and finely painted in the following speech the images of our crimes not only haunt us in our dreams but often become the visions of our waking thoughts all the bars that providence could oppose to vice it has set against it it could no more without depriving man of his free will and so rendering him equally incapable of merit or blame  macbeth going to commit the murder is this a dagger which i see before me the handle toward my hand come let me clutch thee  i have thee not and yet i see thee still art thou not fatal vision sensible to feeling as to sight or art thou but a dagger of the mind a false creation proceeding from the heatoppressed brain i see thee yet in form as palpable as that which now i draw  thou marshalst me the way that i was going and such an instrument i was to use mine eyes are made the fools of the other senses or else worth all the rest  i see thee still and on the blade of the dudgeon gouts gouts drops  from gout french of blood which was not so before  there is no such thing  it is the bloody business which informs thus to mine eyes the remainder of this speech is worth quoting both on account of the fine poetical imagery it contains and in order to show the strong terror which guilt had impressed on his mind by his invoking even inanimate matter not to inform against him  now over one half the world nature seems dead and wicked dreams abuse the curtained sleep now witchcraft celebrates pale hecates offerings and withered murder alarmed by his sentinel the wolf the wolf and all wild beasts go out to prowl at midnight  whose howls his watch thus with his stealthy pace like tarquins theft alluding to a poem of our authors on the story of tarquin and lucrece where he describes his stealing to her chamber in the dead of night  and in cymbeline he makes jachimo say our tarquin thus did softly press the rushes ere he wakened the chastity he wounded act ii scene ii    gliding towered his design the commentators have disagreed about the original line in this place i do not think any of them have sufficiently squared the sense to the expression the liberty i have ventured to take with it has at least rendered the passage intelligible  moves like a ghost  thou sound and firmset earth hear not my steps which way they walk for fear thy very stones prate of my whereabout and take the present horror from the time the horror he means is the dread silence that would be interrupted by the exclamation of the stones which his terror makes him here suppose possible  which now suits with it scene iii lady macbeth speaking here of duncans grooms says that which has made them drunk has made me bold what has quenched them has given me fire   our sex is obliged to shakespeare for this passage he seems to think that a woman could not be rendered completely wicked without some degree of intoxication it required two vices in her one to intend and another to perpetrate the crime he does not give wine and wassail wassail an ancient beverage of ale apples and honey mixed to macbeth leaving him in his natural state to be actuated by the temptation of ambition alone  macbeth after he had committed the murder speaking of the grooms who lay in the antechamber he had just passed through says one cried god bless us and amen the other as they had seen me with these hangmans hands listening their fear  i could not say amen when they did say god bless us but wherefore could i not pronounce amen i had most need of blessing yet amen stuck in my throat   this is natural  one of the most horrid circumstances of guilt is that total suppression a wicked person is apt to labor under for a time of the ability to pray i should think that from this very extraordinary circumstance divines might deduce a good argument to strengthen the christian system of theology if as the advocates for natural religion say our vices proceed from the violence of our passions merely contrition upon their scheme might immediately succeed the gratification of our purpose but as we are taught that temptation arises from the instigation of an evil spirit the fiend has still a further interest in the postponing of our repentance suicide must certainly be a strong instance of this latter doctrine as it prompts us even contrary to the intent of nature and the general scope both of our affections impressions and feelings to the destruction of our own existence  macbeth methought i heard a voice cry sleep no more macbeth does murder sleep  the innocent sleep  sleep that knits up the ravelled sleeve a loose skein of silk doctor seward of care the birth instead of death  warburton of each days life sore labors bath balm of hurt minds great natures second course chief nourisher in lifes feast  in the first part of my remark on the second scene above i have observed upon the impressions that a disturbed mind is apt to stamp on our dreams and sight this passage adds our sense of hearing also to the testimony of our conscience  toward the latter end of this scene there is another hint given to the same admonitory purpose  macbeth whence is that knocking starting how is it with me when every noise appalls me what hands are here hah they pluck out mine eyes   i continued the quotation of the last speech above but one to the end of it in order to treat my reader with the beautiful description of sleep there given by our author and again at the latter end of the fifth scene of the third act lady macbeth says to her husband you lack the season of all nature sleep  the expression here is not only poetical but philosophical also for the vegetable world requires sleep or rest as well as the animal one  scene iv macbeth the labor we delight in physics pain   this expression is very just in general but more particularly so in the present case supposed respecting the offices of friendship and good will how pleasant how easy is duty when inspirited by affection  act iii scene ii the awe with which a bad man though ever so valiant is naturally impressed by the superiority which virtue gives another brave man is well depicted here macbeth to be thus is nothing but to be safely thus  our fears in banquo stick deep and in his royalty of nature reigns that which would be feared it is much he dares and to that dauntless temper of his mind he has a wisdom that does guide his valor to act in safety there is none but he whose being i do fear and under him my genius is rebuked    the text adds the allusion here as anthonys was by caesar which doctor johnson very judiciously rejects as spurious i agree with him  i do not think it is in shakespeares style  the passage is too warm and immediate to admit of so cold and remote an image besides this is a soliloquy and the speaker needed not to have explained his meaning to himself supposing the expression of rebuked had a reference to that idea  the general causes which render men desperate arising from necessities or vices are here set forth  first murderer i am one whom the vile blows and buffets of the world have so incensed that i am reckless heedless or careless what i do to spite it  second murderer and i another so weary of disastrous tuggs with fortune this line is altered for the better by warburton  that i would set my life on any chance to mend it or be rid on it  scene iii the wretched condition of a mind not only laboring under the sense of guilt but dreading the immediate chastisement of it is more strongly painted in this scene than any where else in shakespeare  lady macbeth sola noughts had all is spent where our desires are got without content it is safer to be that which we destroy than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy enter macbeth how now my lord why do you keep alone of sorriest fancies your companions making using those thoughts which should indeed have died with them they think on things without all remedy should be without regard  what is done is done  macbeth we have scotched to scotch is to cut across to slash or wound the snake not killed it  she will close and be herself whilst our poor malice remains in danger of her former tooth but let both worlds disjoint and all things suffer ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep in the affliction of these terrible dreams that shake us nightly  better be with the dead whom we to gain our place have sent to peace than on the torture of the mind to lie in restless ecstasy ecstasy any strong perturbation or distraction of the mind may be so called though the word is seldom used by any other writer but as an expression of pleasure or joy  duncan is in his grave after lifes fitful fever he sleeps well treason has done his worst nor steel nor poison malice domestic foreign levy nothing can touch him further see my second remark on scene ii act i of the former play  o full of scorpions is my mind dear wife  scene v the true spirit of hospitality is well described in the following expostulation from lady macbeth to her husband upon his neglect of the guests my royal lord you do not give the cheer the feast is sold that is not often vouched while it is making it is given with welcome  to feed were best at home from thence the sauce to meat is ceremony meeting were bare without it   in the same scene macbeth speaking in soliloquy upon the appearance of banquos ghost expresses a common notion which however cannot be too strongly inculcated in the mind of man as whatever tends to the service of religion or virtue ceases to be weakness or superstition though perhaps strict philosophy may not assist to support it  it will have blood  they say blood will have blood  stones have been known to move and trees to speak see last line but two of the last speech in scene ii of the former act  augurs that understand relations have by magpies and by choughs choughs seagulls  and rooks brought forth the secretst man of blood scene vi hecate delivers a truth here which would better have become a more moral speaker but shakespeare can gather honey from the weed and make a moral of the devil himself hen v after having mentioned the magic arts by which she is drawing on macbeth to his destruction she adds he shall spurn fate scorn death and bear his hopes bove wisdom grace and fear and you all know security is mortals chiefest enemy   act iv scene ii macbeth upon hearing that macduff had escaped from his design against his life by flying into england makes a reflection which though wickedly applied in the present case may notwithstanding if it is allowable to extract medicine from poison or gather honey from the weed be considered as a good general rule of action in all enterprises of moment  time thou anticipatst anticipate for prevent my dread exploits the flighty purpose never is oertook unless the deed go with it from this moment the very firstlings of my heart shall be the firstlings of my hand and even now to crown my thoughts with acts be it thought and done the castle of macduff i will surprise seize upon fife give to the edge of the sword his wife his babes and all unfortunate souls that trace him in his line  no boasting like a fool this deed i will do before this purpose cool it was a saying of charles the fifth that we should deliberate under saturn but execute under mercury  scene iii in the following dialogue the reader will meet with many just natural and prudent reflections too obvious to need any comment though perhaps those urged by lady macduff are carried a little too far in the present exigence  lady macduff and rosse lady macduff speaking of her husbands flight what had he done to make him fly the land rosse you must have patience madam  lady macduff he had none his flight was madness when our actions do not our fears do make us traitors our laws put the same construction upon it  flight is taken to imply a tacit confession of guilt and whenever this is the case it is always made one of the articles of the indctment that the person charged with a fact had fled for the same   rosse you know not whether it was his wisdom or his fear  lady macduff wisdom to leave his wife to leave his babes his mansion and his titles in a place from whence himself does fly  he loves us not he wants the natural touch for the poor wren the most diminutive of birds will fight her young ones in her nest against the owl see a parallel passage before quoted in these remarks  unreasonable unreasonable for irrational creatures feed their young etc  henry vi part iii act ii scene iii  all is the fear and nothing is the love as little is the wisdom where the flight so runs against all reason  rosse my dearest cousin i pray you school yourself but for your husband he is noble wise judicious and best knows the fits of the season i dare not speak much further i take my leave of you shall not be long but i will be here again  things at the worst will cease or else climb upward to what they were before  but when lady macduff is warned herself to fly she begins at first to reason upon the proposition as she had before done on her husbands flight by pleading the security of her innocence but it becoming now her own case she quickly falls into a more prudent and rational manner of argument upon the subject  this is nature  whither whither for wherefore should i fly i have done no harm but i remember now i am in this earthly world where to do harm is often laudable to do good sometime accounted dangerous folly why then alas do i put up that womanly defense to say i would done no harm scene iv the different natures of men shown in the same circumstances and situations are well discriminated here  malcolm and macduff malcolm let us seek out some desolate shade and there weep our sad bosoms empty  macduff let us rather hold fast the mortal sword and like good men bestride our downfalln birthdame stand over and defend our country from its enemies doctor johnson has supplied the hint of birthdame instead of birthdoom which had no meaning  each new morn new widows howl new orphans cry new sorrows strike heaven on the face assault echo  that it resounds as if it felt with scotland and yelled out like syllables of dolor  malcolm betrays the same timidity of spirit still further in the continuation of this dialogue in refusing to trust his person with macduff though he supports his apprehensions however upon very reasonable grounds of diffidence  what i believe i will wail what know believe and what i can redress as i shall find the time to friend i will  what you have spoke it may be so perchance this tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues was once thought honest you have loved him well he has not touched you yet i am young but something you may deserve of him through me and wisdom and you might think it wisdom shakespeare often sets grammar at defiance his text seldom needs improvement though it sometimes requires explanation  to offer up a weak poor innocent lamb to appease an angry god macduff i am not treacherous  malcolm but macbeth is a good and virtuous nature may recoil in an imperial charge the influence of kings may be too strong for virtue  i crave your pardon that which you are my thoughts cannot transpose transpose  alter the nature of  angels are bright still though the brightest fell  though all things foul should bear the brows of grace yet grace must look still so if you be honest my suspicions touch you not appearances may deceive for virtue can wear no garb but what hypocrisy can assume   macduff i have lost my hopes  malcolm perchance even there where i did find my doubts why in that rawness rawness  unadvisedly and unprovidedly left you wife and children those precious motives those strong knots of love without leavetaking i pray you let not my jealousies be your dishonours but mine own safeties you may be rightly just whatever i shall think  further on he makes an admirable enumeration of those qualities which a good prince ought to be principally possessed of  malcolm the kingbecoming graces as justice verity temperance stableness bounty persevrance mercy lowliness devotion patience courage fortitude  this indeed is to be a king whose first subjects should be his own appetites and passions  scene vi here follows a true but melancholy description of a people suffering under a state of anarchy and civil war the reader has met with many passages of the same kind quoted in this work before  macduff malcolm and rosse just arrived in england malcolm to rosse stands scotland where it did rosse alas poor country almost afraid to know itself it cannot be called our mother but our grave where nothing but who knows nothing is once seen to smile where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air are made not marked where violent sorrow seems a modern extacy alluding to the grimace of the fanatics warburton  the dead mans knell is there scarce asked for whom and good mens lives expire before the flowers in their caps dying or ere they sicken  macduff oh relation too nice and yet too true  malcolm what is the newest grief  rosse that of an hours age does hiss the speaker for telling an old story  each minute teems a new one  in the same dialogue when rosse has given macduff an account of the murder of his wife and children at which he seems to stand petrified with sorrow malcolm justly warns him of the dangerous consequences of restraining the natural shows and expressions of grief  malcolm merciful heaven what man never pull your hat upon your brows  give sorrow words the grief that does not speak whispers the oerfraught heart and bids it break dispute it like a man  to which macduff as justly replies without any disgrace to philosophy or religion i shall do so but i must feel it as a man i cannot but remember such things were that were most precious to me   but he then proceeds to a reflection which though natural and common for the unhappy to make in such circumstances offends against both the principles abovementioned philosophy and religion as being at once impious and unjust did heaven look on and would not take their part   lear on seeing cordelia dead makes an expostulation of the same sort why should a dog a horse a rat have life and thou no breath at all in the last scene of the play    but all this arises from a too presumptuous and overweening notion of our own consequence in the creation the pride of man prompts each to consider himself as the principal object of providence and we would all of us wrest the stated order of nature to serve our own purposes but the true philosophy of the matter is as pope very justly expresses it in different parts of his essay on man the universal cause acts not by partial but by general laws and sees with equal eye as lord of all an hero perish or a sparrow fall atoms or systems into ruin hurled and now a bubble burst and now a world   act v scene i the effects of a guilty and disturbed mind are extremely well represented here in the person of lady macbeth by the words and actions with which she betrays her crime while she is walking in her sleep a great perturbation in nature as her doctor says to receive at once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching  the doctor upon discovering the cause of her malady very justly declares her to be no fit patient for his art and turns her over accordingly to heaven and her confessors for a cure saying unnatural deeds do breed unnatural troubles infected minds to their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets more needs she the divine than the physician god god forgive us all   and again in the third scene the same subject is continued  macbeth how does your patient doctor  doctor not so sick my lord as she is troubled with thickcoming fancies that keep her from her rest  macbeth cure her of that  can thou not minister to a mind diseased pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow raze out the written troubles of the brain and with some sweet oblivious antidote cleanse the full the word is stuffed in the text which i have taken the liberty of changing to full to avoid the tautology which occurs at the end of the line bosom of that perilous stuff which weighs upon the heart  doctor therein the patient must minister unto himself  macbeth throw physic to the dogs i will none of it  scene ii the situation and description of a wicked usurper involved in a domestic war to defend himself is finely painted here  cathness and angus speaking of macbeth cathness some say he is mad others that lesser hate him do call it valiant fury but for certain he cannot buckle his distempered cause within the belt of rule  angus now does he feel his secret murder sticking on his hands now minutely revolts upbraid his faithbreach those he commands move only in command nothing in love now does he feel his title hng  about him like a giants robe upon a dwarfish thief  cathness this speech is spoken by monteth in the original but i thought it needless to encumber the drama with an additional character for so few lines who then shall blame his pestered senses to recoil and start when all that is within him does condemn itself for being there    scene iii but in this scene the tyrant gives a just and shocking description of such a character himself peaking in and of his own person macbeth i have lived long enough  my way way for stage of life is fln into the fear sar is dy by which he alludes to the autumn of his life as is plain from the nex expessin  yellow laf  the yellow leaf and that which should accompany old age as honor love obedience troops of friends i mut not look to have but in their stead curses  loud but deep mouthhomage i have substituted homage for honor as the latter word is made use of just before  breath which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not    scene v the effect of habitual guilt in blunting all the fine feelings of the human heart is well noted here  macbeth on hearing a cry within i have almost forgot the taste of fears the time has been my senses would have cooled to hear a night shriek and my fell fell is the scalp or skin of the head through which the hair grows of hair would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir as life were in it i have supped full with horrors direness familiar to my slaughtrous thoughts cannot once start me  he then falls into a reflection on the nature of human life which presents us with but a melancholy prospect of our present state of existence  tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty pace from day to day to the last syllable of recorded time and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death out out brief candle lifes but a walking shadow a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more it is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing postscript as i cannot bear the thought of suffering the last gloomy passage cited in the foregoing remarks to dwell upon my readers mind which by tempting him to repine at the ways of providence might give him cause to lament his having ever been sent into such a world of woe i shall endeavor to argue as far as i am able against such representations of life as our author frequently gives us of our condition in it and in which he is too generally seconded by many of the more professed writers on morality  these philosophers are apt to speak too severely upon the sum of human life but only seem to condemn it from distinct parts and particular instances which vice folly passions casualty or intemperance too often furnish for observation but i shall here venture to treat this subject more impartially by considering it upon the whole and according to the general state or condition in which the great author of nature has most benevolently supplied it to us  we are created with five perfect senses and the world is stored with variety of objects to afford pleasures to them all and these we are naturally framed to retain the possession of even to the full term of life prescribed by the psalmist of threescore years and ten till that period of time when we may ourselves become weary of a longer continuance here not from the disgust of our disappointments but merely from the satiety of our enjoyments and though our strength may then or even before become weakness it may not however be encumbered either with decrepitude or pain and even to the last we may be still capable of using as much exercise as age requires or if any accidental ail should render more necessary an horse may restore the full benefit at least though perhaps not the use of our limbs  let us add to these the pleasures of hope imagination reflection reading science conversation love friendship relations dear and all the charities of father son and brother even our most moderate satisfactions and enjoyments though their impressions may not be so sensibly felt during their continuance yet if their moment be calculated by multiplying the degree into the duration we shall find the amount to exceed the quantity of more poignant but shorter sensations  let us also take into our account the vicissitude and variety of seasons with the alternation of day and night sweet is the breath of morn her rising sweet with charm of earliest birds pleasant the sun when first on this delightful land he spreads his orient beams on herb tree fruit and flower glittering with dew fragrant the fertile earth after soft showers and sweet the coming on of grateful evening mild then silent night with this her solemn bird and this fair moon and these the gems of heaven her starry train   thus are described the delights of eden by a poet so enamoured of the beauties of nature that he has certainly exerted his utmost powers to enhance her charms and yet even miltons imagination was not able to transcend the reality of those objects and enjoyments which our common fields and gardens afford us every day  this is the common life of man this the condition of the yeoman the husbandman the labourer the artist the mechanic the servant  the many of mankind and where sickness pain loss of any sense or limb happens to the lot of individuals this is not according to the course of nature but rather a violence against it and these accidents afflict not the many but the few nor is providence any more answerable for the natural than for the moral ills of life one is but incidental to the general constitution and necessity of things and the other to the appetites and free will of man  but sloth luxury ambition vicious passions envy hatred and malice may render some diseased in body and others discontented in mind this is not however the condition of their nature but the corruption of it and these are still not the many but the few not the body of the people but the excrescences which arise out of it and must be nourished at its cost  namely the great the opulent and the proud   the happiness of life depends on our discretion  look into those they call unfortunate and closer viewed you will find they are unwise some flaw in their own conduct lies beneath and it is the trick of fools to save their credit which brought another language into use the revenge if what i have here said upon this comparative view of human nature were not true providence must have shown a manifest partiality to the inferior creation which is certainly placed in an happier state than man according to some  to many writers but plato speaks upon this subject with a much better philosophy than any of these moral sophisters when he says that god is good for he bestows all that is good upon all creatures according to their several capacities each is as happy as it can be or as its nature permits and if any thinks the several creatures could have been happier it is because he does not understand their natures  who sees not providence all good and wise alike in what it gives and what denies pope it may not be improper to quote a passage here out of a letter from mr pope to doctor swift upon the subject of his essay on man  i am just now says he writing or rather planning a book to bring mankind to look upon this life with comfort and pleasure and put morality in good humor with itself  this is the true philosophy of sense and virtue gloomy minds are deficient in both  coriolanus dramatis personae men caius marcius coriolanus cominius menenius agrippa brutus sicinius senators citizens women volumnia virgilia coriolanus act i scene i enter a number of mutinous citizens armed with various weapons first citizen before we proceed any further hear me speak   all speak speak   first citizen you are all resolved rather to die than to famish   all resolved resolved   first citizen first you know caius marcius is the chief enemy to the people   all we know it we know it   first citizen let us kill him and well have corn at our own price is it a verdict   all no more talking on it let it be done away away   second citizen one word good citizens   first citizen we are accounted poor citizens the patricians good what authority surfeits on would relieve us if they would yield us but the superfluity while it were wholesome we might guess they relieved us humanely but they think we are too dear not worth the charge of maintaining  the leanness that afflicts us the object of our misery is as an inventory to particularize their abundance our sufferance is a gain to them let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become rakes this miserable clinch is not worth the trouble of correcting or explaining  for the gods know i speak this in hunger for bread not in thirst for revenge   the nature and reasoning of all mutinous caballers are fully shown in the above short scene the common people are apt to impute all national grievances or calamities to the fault of their rulers though ever so unavoidable from the nature of things failure of seasons or other incidental misfortunes whatsoever if freedom of speech and the liberty of the press were not restrained in turkey i make no doubt but a mussulman populace would charge the plague to the account of their sultans or their viziers  in the same scene that abatement of esteem and praise which is the natural consequence of persons appearing to overrate their own merits more especially when this is betrayed by showing pride or contempt to others is very justly remarked on  second citizen would you proceed especially against caius marcius   all against him first he is a very dog to the commonalty   second citizen consider you what services he has done for his country   first citizen very well and could be content to give him good report for it but that he pays himself with being proud   all nay but speak not maliciously   first citizen i say unto you what he has done famously he did it to that end though softconscienced men can be content to say it was for his country he did it to please his mother and to be partly proud which he is even to the altitude of his virtue   the above expression of to please his mother is taken verbatim from plutarch who in the life of coriolanus says of him the end which others proposed in their acts of valor was glory but he pursued glory because the acquisition of it delighted his mother  though this seems to be a childish reason yet it is very well to be accounted for his father died when caius marcius was but an infant the care of his education then devolved upon the mother who gave him his first lessons of bravery and honor and took pains to inspire his youth with that martial spirit which she thought became a roman and a patrician it was natural then that his exploits should still bear a reference to the person under whose tutelage he had been trained to arms  scene ii here menenius agrippa expostulates with the unruly populace in a manner conformable to my first remark on the preceding scene  menenius why masters my good friends mine honest neighbors will you undo yourselves  citizen we cannot sir we are undone already   menenius i tell you friends most charitable care have the patricians of you for your wants your sufferings in this dearth you may as well strike at the heavens with your staves as lift them against the roman state whose course will on the way it takes cracking ten thousand curbs of more strong links asunder than can ever appear in your impediment for the dearth the gods not the patricians make it and your knees to them not arms must help alack you are transported by calamity thither where more attends you and you slander the helms of the state who care for you like fathers when you curse them as enemies  but this argument not quieting the tumult he proceeds to give them the famous apologue of the belly and members borrowed from aesop which though already so generally known that it need not be related yet as the reader may choose to see the story in shakespeares style and manner of telling it i shall supply the fable here leaving out the several breaks and interruptions of the dialogue in which it is recited  menenius either you must confess yourselves wondrous malicious or be accused of folly i shall tell you a pretty tale it may be you have heard it but since it serves my purpose i will venture to stale t stale it to render it more stale by repeating it theobald the word in the text is scale a little more there was a time when all the bodys members rebelled against the belly thus accused it  that only like a gulf it did remain in the midst of the body idle and unactive still cupboarding the viand never bearing like labor with the rest where fitly for exactly warburton the other instruments did see and hear devise instruct walk feel and mutually participate did minister unto the appetite and affection common of the whole body  the belly answered and tauntingly replied to the discontented members the mutinous parts that envied his receipts  even so most fitly where for whereas johnson  as you malign our senators for that they are not such as you  note me good friend your most grave belly was deliberate not rash like his accusers and thus answered  true is it my incorporate the word incorporate has a double propriety in this place as applying equally to the body natural and the body politic the commentators have given notes upon more insignificant passages friends quoth he that i receive the general food at first which you do live upon and fit it is because i am the storehouse and the shop of the whole body but if you do remember i send it through the rivers of your blood even to the court the heart to the seat of the brain and through the cranks cranks put here for the circulation of the blood and other juices of the body crank signifies a winding passage and offices of man the strongest nerves and small inferior veins from me receive that natural competency whereby they live and though that all at once you my good friends this says the belly mark me though all at once you cannot see what i do deliver out to each yet i can make my audit up that all from me do back receive the flour of all and leave me but the bran  he then gives them the exposition of the allegory in the following words the senators of rome are this good belly and you the mutinous members for examine their counsels and their cares digest things rightly touching the weal of the common you shall find no public benefit which you receive but it proceeds or comes from them to you and no way from yourselves   scene iii here coriolanus in a style of austerity and haughtiness which he preserves through the whole of his spirited but harsh character rates the malecontent citizens in a speech which truly describes the nature of every populace in all free states  he that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring what would ye have ye curs that likes like instead of like nor peace nor war whose dispositions belong both cowardly and insolent are neither suited to a state of peace or war nor peace nor war the one affrights you the other makes you proud he that trusts to you where he should find you lions finds you hares where foxes geese you are no surer no than is the coal of fire upon the ice or hailstone in the sun your virtue virtue for nature or quality is to make him worthy whose offense subdues him and curse that justice did it this passage surely needed an explanation to all but the quick conceptions of the commentators who have therefore neglected it the meaning i take to be this you would chant ut hymns of triumph to the conqueror who should enslave while you would  in arms against the laws that would restrain you  who deserves greatness deserves your hate and your affections are a sick mans appetite who desires most that which would increase his evil  he that depends upon your favors swims with fins of lead and hews down oaks with rushes  hang ye  trust ye with every minute you do change a mind and call him noble that was now your hate him vile that was your garland what is the matter that in the several places of the city you cry against the noble senate who under the gods keep you in awe which else would feed on one another and afterward speaking of them to menenius he adds they will sit by the fire and presume to know what is done in the capitol who is like to rise who thrives and who declines side factions and give out conjectural marriages marriages for leagues or alliances  making parties strong and feeble such as stand not in their liking below their cobbled shoes   scene vi this place affords us a description of the characteristic roman matron of those times set in contrast with the woman of nature  volumnia the mother and virgilia the wife of coriolanus after he had marched against the volscians volumnia i pray you daughter sing or express yourself in a more comfortable sort if my son were my husband i would freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honor than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love when yet he was but tender bodied and the only son of my hope when youth with comeliness plucked all gaze that way when for a day of a kings entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding i considering how honor would become such a person that it was no better than picturelike to hang  the wall if renown made it not stir was pleased to see him seek anger where he was like to find fame to a cruel war i sent him from whence he returned his brows bound with oak the  wreath given as a mark of distinction to those who had saved the l of a citizen in battle  i tell thee daughter i sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man child than now in first seeing he had proved himself a man   virgilia but had he died in the business madam how then   volumnia then his good report should have been my son i therein would have found issue hear me profess sincerely had i a dozen sons each in my love alike and none less dear than thine and my good marcius i had rather eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action   there appears to be a vast difference here between the sentiments of these two matrons but this may well be accounted for from the difference of their situations and circumstances of life volumnia having been left a widow in the infancy of her son and taking upon herself the charge of his education had it may be supposed soon silenced the tenderness of a mother in her breast and assumed the spirit of a father to fulfill her trust and by constantly endeavoring to inspire her pupil with the chief virtues of a roman magnanimity and love of his country she may be said in a manner to have educated herself at the same time to bravery fortitude and contempt of death  scene ix the true character of a soldier is well described in this scene when coriolanus in the heat of battle and covered with blood demands a fresh supply of troops from cominius the general answers take your choice of those that best can aid your action coriolanus those are they that are most willing if any such be here as it were sin to doubt that love this painting wherein you see me smeared if any fear pointing to his bloody front less for his person than an ill report if any think brave death outweighs bad life and that his countrys dearer than himself let him alone or many if so minded wave thus to express his disposition waving his hand and follow marcius    act ii scene ii that warmth of affection with which menenius greets good news from his friend must charm the sensible reader on hearing that coriolanus had defeated the volscians and written a letter to him on that occasion he cries out in transport take my cap meaning i will throw up my cap to the skies for joy doctor warburton changes the word to cup as designing a libation of thanks  i think unnecessarily  jupiter and i thank thee hoo marcius coming home i will make my house reel tonight a letter for me it gives me an estate of seven years health in which time i will make a lip at the physician scorn the aid of physic  the most sovereign prescription in galen is but empiric and to this preservative of no better report of no more value or estimation than a horsedrench  and again in the next scene upon meeting him he expresses the fullness of his heart which exceeds even to pain in very strong and apt terms a hundred thousand welcomes  i could weep and i could laugh i am light and heavy  welcome   these speeches have a double beauty in them if it is considered by whom they are delivered it would not have near the effect upon the reader if spoken by a more stayed and sober person for virtues are apt to strike us more forcibly in slight characters than in solid ones and menenius has already given us a description of himself in the preceding scene which sufficiently justifies me in this distinction i am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves a cup of  wine without a drop of allaying tiber in it said to be somethig imperfect in savouring the first complaint apt too quickly to follow the suggestions of my appetite  hasty and tindlike upon too trivial motion one that converses more with t buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning wha i think i utter and spend my malice in my breath  scene iii as i have quoted several descriptions of character before in the course of this work for the reason already given in its proper place as being within the prescription of moral and besides that those were merely imaginary though truly copied from real life i think that this one of coriolanus being sufficiently vouched from authentic story plutarch livy etc  ought therefore to be more particularly remarked upon in these notes  in the first scene of the former act in a passage above quoted second remark one of the discontented citizens charges him with paying himself for his services with being proud and his reproach was just but yet here he seems to appear in a light the very reverse of such a character for when the herald in the voice of rome is proclaiming his merits he stops him short by crying out no more of this it does offend my heart pray now no more   he manifests the same modesty also in the sixth scene following when he appears to be uneasy in his seat upon the applause given him for his prowess one of the senators says to him sit coriolanus never shame to hear what you have nobly done to which he replies your honors pardon  i would rather have my wounds to heal again than hear say how i got them brutus sir i hope my words disbenched you not this alludes to a speech of his in this sene not quoted here where he charges coriolanus with his contempt of the people   coriolanus no sir yet often when blows have made me stay i fled from words  you soothe not therefore hurt not but your people i love them as they weigh  menenius pray now sit down  coriolanus i had rather have one scratch my head in the sun when the alarm were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monstered monstered so much wondered at   menenius you see to the people he had rather venture all his limbs for honor than one of s ears to hear it    afterward cominius speaking of him says our spoils he kicked at and looked upon things precious as they were the common muck of the world he covets less than misery misery for avarice itself would give rewards his deeds with doing them and is content to spend his time to spend it to do great actions for the sake of doing them the comment and the alteration of the text from end it to spend it is doctor johnsons    again when he is pressed to harangue the people in order to get himself elected consul he answers in the same style and spirit of character i beseech you let me oerleap that custom for i cannot put on the gown stand naked exposing his body to show his wounds  and entreat them for my wounds sake to give their suffrages  please you that i may pass this doing scinius sir the people must have their voices nor will they bate one jot of ceremony  menenius put them not to it  pray it you to the custom and take to ye as your predecessors have your honor with your form  coriolanus it is a part that i shall blush in acting and might well be taken from the people to brag unto them thus i did and thus  show them the unaching scars which i would hide as if i had received them for the hire of their breath only    but these seeming contradictions form in effect but one character still the overvaluing his merits and the undervaluing the applause of them are both equally founded in pride fierceness and impatience plutarch draws a comparison of coriolanus with alcibiades but i think he more resembles achilles as described by horace vigilant irascible inflexible harsh and above all laws acknowledging no rights but those of conquest impiger iracundus inexorabilis acer jra neget fibi nata nihil non arroge armis    let us now return to the third scene again from whence the pursuit of our subject had tempted us to wander  when coriolanus comes home victorious from the volscian war his family and friends gather about him complimenting and congratulating him on his bravery and success all but virgilia his wife whose heart being fuller of joy and fondness than them all put together was therefore rendered incapable of uttering a syllable on that occasion  upon which he salutes her thus my gracious silence hail  doctor warburton gives the following note upon this passage the epithet joined to silence shows it not to proceed from sullenness or reserve but to be the effect of a virtuous mind possessing itself in peace the expression is extremely sublime and the sense of it conveys the finest praise that can be given to a woman  i perfectly agree with the doctor in his opinion both of the beauty of the expression and the merit of the character implied in it i have taken the liberty of leaving out the adjunct good joined to the last word in his note as being superfluous in that place for no bad one can possibly deserve praise  scene vii coriolanus preserves still the same kind of indomitable sturdiness and severity in the following speech where he also takes occasion very justly to censure the superstitious reverence the world is too apt to bear toward customs which are not founded in reason  when he has with infinite difficulty been prevailed upon by his friends to solicit votes for the consulate and having obtained them being left alone he speaks thus to himself most sweet voices  better it is to die better to starve than crave the hire which first we do deserve why in this woolvish the candidates gown was made of rough undyed wool gown should i stand here to beg of hob and dick that do appear their needless voucher custom calls me to it  what custom wills in all things should we do it the dust on antique time would lie unswept and mountainous error be too highly heapt for truth to oerpeer  rather than fool it so let the high office and the honor go to one that would do thus   act iv scene i the difference between the philosophy we preach and that we practice is properly distinguished in this scene  when coriolanus is going into exile and taking leave of his family and friends he endeavors to restrain the immoderate grief of his mother on that occasion by repeating those stoical precepts to her which she had often inculcated to him during the term of his pupilage  coriolanus come leave your tears  a brief farewell the beast with many heads butts me away  nay mother where is your ancient courage you were used to say extremity was the trier of spirits that common chances common men could bear that when the sea was calm all boats alike showed mastership in floating fortunes blows when most struck home being gentle wounded craves a noble cunning this passage is confusedly expressed  the meaning is that when fortune has given us severe blows to preserve a mild or gentle temper under our wounds requires a well practiced philosophy which he calls cunning as being a difficult art  science  you were used to load me with precepts that would make invincible the heart that conned them  volumnia now the red pestilence strike all trades in rome and occupations perish  coriolanus what what what i shall be loved when i am lacked  nay mother resume that spirit when you wee wont to say if you had been the wife of hercules six of his labors you would have done and saved your husband so much sweat cominius droop not adieu  farewell my wife my mother i will do well yet  thou old and true menenius thy tears are salter than a younger mans and venomous to thine eyes my sometime general i have seen thee stern and thou have often beheld hearthardning spectacles  tell these sad women it is fond  s weak idle or foolish to wail inevitable strokes as it is to laugh at them  scene iii in the following speech there is too true a picture given of the instability of human friendships and connections  coriolanus oh world thy slippery turns friends now fast sworn whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart whose hours whose bed whose meal and exercise are still together who twine as twere in love unseparable shall within this hour on a dissension of a doit break out to bitterest enmity so fellest foes whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep to take the one the other by some chance some trick some slight occasion or trivial motive  not worth an egg shall grow dear friends and interjoin their issues  act v scene i menenius when he is going to parley with coriolanus on the part of rome makes a speech which shows a perfect knowledge of human nature for certainly a proper attention to times seasons and circumstances goes a considerable way toward the success of our requests  i will undertake it i think he will hear me  yet to bite his lip and hum at good cominius much unhearts me he was not taken well he had not dined  the veins unfilled our blood is cold and then we pout upon the morning are unapt to give or to forgive but when we have stuffed these pipes and these conveyances of blood with wine and feeding we have suppler souls than in our priestlike fasts therefore i will watch him till he be dieted to my request and then i will set upon him scene iii coriolanus upon seeing his wife mother and son come habited in mourning to solicit in favor of rome says my wife comes foremost then the honored mould wherein this trunk was framed and in her hand the grandchild to her blood  but out affection all bond and privilege of nature break let it be virtuous to be obstinate virgilia bends what is that curtsie worth or those doves eyes which might make gods forsworn i melt and am not of stronger earth than others my mother bows as if olympus to a molehill should in supplication nod and my young boy has an aspect of intercession which great nature cries deny not  let the volscians plough rome and harrow italy i will never be such a gosling to obey instinct but stand as if a man were author of himself and knew no other kin   coriolanus has here carried his sternness and the strained principles of stoical pride whose throne is only in the mind as far as they could go and now great nature whose more sovereign seat of empire is in the heart takes her turn to triumph for upon the joint prayers tears and entreaties of his family he becomes a man at last crying out  not of a womans tenderness to be requires nor child nor womans face to see  i have sat too long endeavors to go but is withheld   and afterward being quite overcome by his affections he thus exclaims o mother mother holding her hands and keeping silent for some time what have you done behold the heavens do open the gods look down and this unnatural scene do laugh at look down with contempt on the unequal strife between pride and nature  oh my mother mother oh you have won a happy victory to rome but for your son  believe it oh believe it  most dangerously you have with him prevailed if not most mortal to him  let it come    the expressions in the first part of this latter speech with the prophetical conclusion of it are taken almost literally from plutarch in his life of coriolanus  julius caesar dramatis personae men julius caesar mark antony brutus cassius octavius metellus cimber messala lucilius artemidorus women none julius caesar in this scene there is a notion delivered which may be productive of good or bad effects according to the characters of the persons who embrace it in rational and virtuous minds it may inspire an active pursuit of fortune in whatever profession or scene of life they are engaged in but in weak or wicked natures may betray to hazardous schemes or tempt to vicious courses the same principle has made generals and admirals of common soldiers and sailors chancellors and bishops of attorneys clerks and sizers sizer the lowest rank of students in an university  on the one part projectors conspirators usurpers and assassins on the other  cassius men at some times are masters of their fates the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings brutus and caesar what should be in that caesar why should that name be sounded more than yours write them together yours is as fair a name sound them it does become the mouth as well weigh them it is as heavy conjure with them brutus will start a spirit as soon as caesar  now in the names of all the gods at once upon what meat does this our caesar feed that he is grown so great  scene iv there is a truly philosophic reflection made here on the several characters of men taken both from their persons and manners this is one of the many instances of our authors knowledge and observation upon human nature  caesar and antony let me have men about me that are fat sleekheaded men and such as sleep anights you cassius has a lean and hungry look he thinks too much  such men are dangerous antony fear him not caesar he is not dangerous he is a noble roman and well given  caesar would he were fatter  but i fear him not  yet if my name i was temped to change this word to mind as being more intelligible but i recollected that shakespeare meant to make caesar affect to speak of his name as his person  he says afterward in the same speech for always i am caesar and throughout in the same sile were liable to fear i do not know the man i should avoid so soon as that spare cassius he reads much he is a great observer and he looks quite through the deeds of men he loves no plays as thou do antony he hears no music seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort as if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit that could be moved to smile at any thing such men as he be never at hearts ease whilst they behold a greater than themselves and therefore are they very dangerous  scene v brutus and cassius brutus speaking of casca what a blunt fellow is this grown to be he was quick mettle when he went to school cassius so is he now in execution of any bold or noble enterprise however he puts on this tardy form this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit which gives men stomach to digest his words with better appetite  the above is a sort of character we often meet with in life and which has generally the effect here attributed to it  in the same scene there is a just and prudent maxim set forth with regard to the persons and characters that men should associate themselves with who would preserve either their understanding their honor or integrity  cassius well brutus thou art noble yet i see thy honorable metal may be wrought from what it is disposed therefore it is meet that noble minds keep ever with their likes for who so firm that cannot be seduced  some moral writer says that if men of sense taste or virtue have not an opportunity of conversing with their equals they had much better live alone they will certainly be able to preserve these rare qualities much better in solitude than in unequal society  there is a contagion in minds and manners as well as in bodies when corrupt  act ii scene i brutus solus it must be by his death and for my part i have no personal cause to spurn at him but for the general  he would be crowned how that might change his nature there is the question it is the bright day that brings forth the adder and that craves wary walking  crown him  that  and then i grant we put a sting in him that at his will he may do danger with the abuse of greatness is when it disjoins remorse from power and to speak truth of caesar i have not known when his affections swayed more than his reason but it is a common proof that lowliness is young ambitions ladder whereto the climber upwards turns his face but when he once attains the utmost round he then unto the ladder turns his back looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees by which he did ascend so caesar may  then lest he may prevent  and since the quarrel will bear no color for the thing he is we have no pretense for destroying him from his present appearance of character  fashion it thus that what he is augmented would run to these and these extremities and therefore think him as a serpents egg which hatched would as his kind grow mischievous and kill him in the shell  in this soliloquy or selfdebate upon the intended assassination of caesar the too common frailty of man in the circumstances of successful ambition is strongly described under two very just and poetical images but the inference drawn from it in the conclusion is certainly carried too far it might perhaps have become an heathen to prevent an ill without respecting the means but a christian thank god is forbidden to do evil even though good should come of it  in the continuance of this soliloquy brutus gives a strong description of the state of mind which precedes the execution of any great or hazardous purpose  since cassius first did whet me against caesar i have not slept between the acting of a dreadful thing and the first motion all the interim is like a phantasma or a hideous dream the genius and the mortal instruments he supposes a struggle between the good genius and the passions  are then in council and the state of man like to a little kingdom suffers then the nature of an insurrection mr addison in his cato has a reflection of the same kind but it would be illiberal to quote it here after the strength of imagery and expression in this of shakespeares  besides indeed as doctor warburton heartily allows there was a great difference between the two occasions  even as much we may add as there is between the two speeches  scene ii the needlessness of oaths to bind compacts between honest men to which indeed might be added the insufficiency of them to bind knaves is well urged in this place  when the cautious cassius proposes to the conspirators that they shall all enter into a solemn covenant together to sanctify their mutual engagements the nobler brutus opposes it in the following words no not an oath if not the face of men the face of men either the dejected looks of the people or their countenance and approbation of the measure  the sufferance of our souls the times abuse if these be motives weak break off betimes and every man hence to his idle bed so let highsighted tyranny range on till each man drop by lottery  but if these as i am sure they do bear fire enough to kindle cowards and to steel with valor the melting spirits of women then countrymen what need we any spur but our own cause to prick us to redress what other bond than secret romans that have spoke the word and will not palter to palter to shift or shuffle  and what other oath than honesty to honesty engaged that this shall be or we will fall for it swear priests and cowards and men cautelous old feeble carrions and such suffering souls that welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear such creatures as men doubt but do not stain the even virtue of our enterprise nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits to think that or our cause or our performance did need an oath when every drop of blood that every roman bears and nobly bears is guilty of a several bastardy if he does break the smallest particle of any promise that has past from him   cicero is then proposed to be added to their league and for the following good and prudent reason metellus cimber o let us have him for his silver hairs will purchase us a good opinion and buy mens voices to commend our deeds  it shall be said his judgment ruled our hands our youth and wildness shall no whit appear but all be buried in his gravity    but he is objected to on account of a sort of character which is not uncommon in life and is justly descriptive also of the person to whom it is applied who though certainly a very great man was notwithstanding a vain and selfopinionated one likewise  brutus o name him not let us not break with him impart the secret to him  for he will never follow any thing that other men begin  afterward when cassius urges the expediency of involving antony in the same doom with caesar brutus very nobly refuses to concur upon the following reasons our course will seem too bloody caius cassius to cut the head off and then hack the limbs like wrath in death and envy envy for malice afterward for antony is but a limb of caesar and in the spirit of man there is no blood oh that we then could come by caesars spirit and not dismember caesar but alas caesar must bleed for it  and gentle friends let us kill him boldly but not wrathfully let us carve him as a dish fit for the gods not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds and let our hearts as subtle masters do stir up their servants to an act of rage and after seem to chide them this passage is very obscure and the commentators according to their usual supineness have left it unnoticed the meaning may be this  let us impute the act to our passions instigated by our fears and then appear to lament the violence of their proceedings  this shall make our purpose necessary and not envious which so appearing to the common eyes we shall be deemed purgers not murderers   it were much to be wished for the sake both of decency and humanity that such a sentiment as this was the spirit of laws relative to all capital punishments  breaking on the wheel empaling and other foreign penalties of death are horrible even to thought and what must they be to the view even our own code though reckoned milder than our neighbors is hardly less barbarous in the instances of quartering burning and pressing to death if executed according to the full rigor of the sentence but the hangman it seems has more humanity than the legislature as he is said always to render the criminal senseless before he proceeds to the severity of the statute he first kills the spirit the demon of the law and then only executes the dead letter of it  there is a sentiment upon this subject in a late writing which i think may very properly be quoted here i would have all laws mild but executed with the utmost strictness so that justice and humanity may go hand in hand together i am not for severe executions for when the penalty exceeds the offense it is not the criminal but human nature that suffers death alone is sufficient to remove the offender series of letters between henry and frances   but methinks this argument might be urged still further in favor of clemency  suppose we should reason thus all laws are a mutual compact of society entered into with itself the many can confide to the few those rights only which they respectively possess in themselves to confer a power of death then should seem to imply a right of suicide i declare myself unable to detect any manner of sophistry in such a syllogism  scene iv caesar cowards die many times before their deaths the valiant never taste of death but once  of all the wonders that i yet have heard it seems to me most strange that men should fear seeing that death a necessary end will come when it will come  the philosophy of death is well enough argued here according to the old stoical doctrine of fate or predestination this should seem to be a good notion for a mere soldier but yet we do not find in the late carnage the war between the czarina and the port  that it rendered the turks braver who believe in it than it did the russians who do not  act iii scene i caesar speaks a sentence here which shows him to have been worthy of a better fate  when artemidorus upon seeing the number of papers presented to him on his march to the capital cries out o caesar read mine first for mine is a suit that touches caesar nearer  read it great caesar  he replies in the true spirit of a prince what touches us ourself shall be last served  and afterward when metellus cimber pleads for the repeal of his brothers banishment he answers him with the proper steadiness of a person entrusted with the executive province of a legislature i must prevent thee cimber  these couchings and these lowly courtesies might stir stir instead of fire warburton the blood of ordinary men and turn preordinance and first decree into the law law instead of lane of children whose minds are easily wrought on johnson of children be not fond be not so weakly persuaded  to think that caesar bears such rebel blood that will be thawed from the true quality with that which melts fools i mean sweet words low crooked courtesies and base spanielfawning  thy brother by decree is banished if thou do bend and pray and fawn for him i spurn thee like a cur out of my way  know caesar does not wrong nor without cause will he be satisfied   i cannot help thinking that the poet has not given either caesar fair play for his life or brutus for his character in bringing on the assassination so immediately after the one has uttered and the other heard the two foregoing speeches  the last sentence above was not necessary to be quoted for the purpose of the speech merely as far as it had been specified in the note which precedes it but i confess that i was anxious to produce it in order to take an opportunity of vindicating our author from an absurdity of expression which has been so disingenuously imputed to him by his rival ben johnson who charges him with having wrote that passage thus caesar never did wrong but with just cause  now o rare ben johnson the epithet by which he is characterised on his tomb  what manner of foundation could thou have for such a sarcasm except in the envious malice of thine own nature for the very copy from which the present text is taken was published in thine own lifetime  or suppose that the line had really stood as johnson has pretended to have quoted it might not any candid critic who was at all versed in the latitude of expression generally made use of by shakespeare have sufficiently obviated the contradiction in the terms by only construing the word wrong into the sense of injury for a penalty is certainly an injury in the sense of hurt or detriment  though not a wrong  i hope my reader will not think this note to be any manner of interruption to the general tenor of these remarks as he must acknowledge that there is a proper moral in defending the author of this great code of ethics from any aspersion thrown out against his sense meaning or character  in the last passage of this scene the two principal patriots brutus and cassius show a noble spirit in not endeavoring to support themselves after the deed by faction in the common sense of the word trusting solely to the justice and policy they had presumed in the act itself for their security and defense  cassius speaking to publius who was present at the transaction but not any way concerned in the conspiracy says leave us publius lest that the people rushing on us should do your age some mischief brutus do so and let no man abide this deed but we the doers    scene ii besides that inward complacency which a virtuous person is sensible of in the consciousness of his merits there is something further in human nature which prompts his reflection forward to the fame which may attend his actions in future times our author has placed this incitement in the strongest light by delivering the sentiment from the confession of two such stoical interlocutors as the following cassius how many ages hence shall this our lofty scene be acted over in states unborn and accents yet unknown  brutus how many times shall caesar bleed in sport that now on pompeys basis lies along no worthier than the dust  cassius so often as that shall be so often shall the knot of us be called the men that gave their country liberty    scene iii antony on seeing the body of caesar o mighty caesar do thou lie so low are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils shrunk to this little measure the above exclamation is a dirge which may be justly pronounced over the graves of all heroes or other great men whose fame is not founded in virtue  act iv scene i as the following description falls under the head of character for which i have long since opened an account in these remarks as relative to manners at least but often to morals i shall present it to the reader who must have made but little observation on life if it does not bring many resemblances of the same picture into his mind  antony and octavius speaking of lepidus whom they had just dispatched to bring them caesars will antony this is a slight unmeritable man meet to be sent on errands  octavius but he is a tried and valiant soldier  antony so is my horse octavius and for that i do appoint him store of provender it is a creature that i teach to fight to wind to stop to run directly on his corporal motion governed by my spirit and in some taste is lepidus but so  he must be taught and trained and bid go forth a barrenspirited fellow one that feeds on abject orts orts refuse scraps or lumber of philosophy or literature  and imitations which out of use and staled become vulgar and commonplace by other men begin his fashion do not talk of him but as a property    scene ii the following passage may be added to the many instances of our authors knowledge of human nature collected from his close observations on mankind  brutus having sent lucilius to cassius upon some friendly or confederate business between them asks him on his return a word lucilius how he received you let me be resolved lucilius with courtesy and with respect enough but not with such familiar instances nor with such free and friendly conference as he has used of old  brutus thou have described a hot friend cooling ever note lucilius when love begins to sicken and decay it uses an enforced ceremony there are no tricks in plain and simple faith but hollow men like horses hot at hand make gallant show and promise of their mettle but when they should endure the bloody spur they fall their crest and like deceitful jades sink in the trial    scene v brutus on hearing of his wifes death why farewell portia we must die messala with meditating that she must die once i have the patience to endure it now cassius i have as much of this in art as you but yet my nature could not bear it so    here brutus speaks like a stoic and cassius like a man such instances of apathy are not captivating  a little after he says the deep of night is crept upon our talk and nature must obey necessity which we will niggard with a little rest now pray why should nature be more obedient to necessity in sleeping than in weeping she has her course in both let proud man boast what he will  a modern writer asks very justly why we should be more ashamed of weeping than of laughing the first emotion says he arises from nobler motives and more generous principles man has been defined to be a risible animal methinks it would be more for the honor of his nature to have been styled a lachrymate one understanding the expression in a moral sense by distinguishing between the effect of pain and grief  further on in the same scene the critical contingencies of human life are finely illustrated by an apt and beautiful simile  brutus there is a tide in the affairs of men which taken at the flood leads on to fortune omitted all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries on such a full sea are we now afloat and we must take the current when it serves or lose our ventures  act v scene iii brutus o that a man might know the end of this days business ere it come but it suffices that the day will end and then the end is known  here the disciple of zeno father of the stoic philosophy  being off his guard betrays a portion of human frailty in his curiosity and anxiety about the event of the battle but upon recollecting his philosophy he recovers himself to his posture of defense again such pretenders are but performers actors of parts  when closely examined  scene v when cassius has killed himself through despair from his having mistaken the appearances of an action which had turned out in his favor our author makes a just reflection upon the fatal effects of error and precipitancy  messala mistrust of good success has done this deed oh hateful error melancholys child why do thou show to the apt apt for quick credulous easily alarmed thoughts of men the things that are not o error soon conceived thou never come unto a happy birth but killst the mother that engendered thee  scene ix i shall here conclude my remarks upon this play with that fine character which antony draws of brutus in the generous elogy he makes upon his death  this was the noblest roman of them all  all the conspirators save only he did that they did in envy of great caesar he only in a general honest thought and common good to all made one of them his life was gentle and the elements so mixed in him that nature might stand up and say to all the world  this was a man postscript the assassination of caesar is a fact famous in history but notwithstanding the heroic opinion which the world has been taught to conceive of it i confess that i have ever reputed its fame as a matter of notoriety rather than of applause  i shall only consider this action in the person of brutus alone because it has been thought that he was the only one among the conspirators who had engaged in it upon principle solely as antony has said above  plutarch has debated this subject in his comparison of brutus with dion and in my opinion seems to condemn it upon the whole at least if we take in the character he there draws of caesar with the state and circumstances of the commonwealth at that political crisis it plainly appears that he meant to declare against it  his words are with respect to caesar though whilst his imperial power was in its infancy he treated his opponents with severity yet as soon as that power was confirmed the tyranny was rather a nominal than a real thing for no tyrannical action could be laid to his charge nay such was the condition of rome then that it evidently required a master and caesar was no more than a tender and skilful physician appointed by providence to heal the distempers of the state of course the people lamented his death and were implacably enraged against his assassins  cowley in his fine ode to brutus brings heavy charges also against him on account of this action though he seems only to do so in order to vindicate him from them but then he does not pretend to defend him from the facts themselves justifying him only upon the higher principle which had rendered him guilty of them  however i think that he is severer upon his hero even than plutarch by mentioning that weak and unphilosophic exclamation of his where he says he had mistaken virtue for a good but found it only a name  what can we say but thine own tragic word that virtue which had worshipped been by thee as the most solid good and greatest deity by this fatal proof became an idol only and a name this circumstance his biographer had favorably suffered to pass unnoticed and of which balzac says that brutus seems to lament his disappointment here as if he was upbraiding a jilting mistress if he had acted solely from virtue he would not have complained that he had missed the reward  but though the principle might have been ever so right in itself the action was certainly wrong in him there are duties involved in duties sometimes which may counteract each other and thereby render what might be the virtue of one person the vice of another many situations and cases of this kind may be proposed but i shall not launch beyond my subject  brutus had many and great obligations to caesar he owed him his life  nay it is said even his first life caesar had an amor with servilia the mother of brutus before his birth  and had the lives of several of his friends saved also at his intercession he had ever lived with him in the greatest intimacy and on the footing of his first friend nay caesar had created himself enemies by his partiality toward him in the preferring him to posts of profit and honor which others from their services were better entitled to one of these malcontents was cassius who from that very resentment became the first mover and principal actor in the conspiracy and were all these obligations to be cancelled by one dash of the stoics pen  stoical virtues are not always moral ones those metaphysical braveries for i was wrong in calling them virtues which exceed the feelings of humanity have never as i said before see first observation on scene i act ii and another on first part of scene v act iv  been able to inspire my mind with either admiration or esteem  the sympathy of nature is wanting and true philosophy has good reason to suspect every principle or motive of action to be sophisticate that bears not this original impression  antony and cleopatra dramatis personae men m antony octavius caesar agrippa mecaenas ventidius enobarbus sextus pompey menas menocrates eros scarus clown women cleopatra her women charmian iras  antony and cleopatra act i scene iii the usefulness of listening to advice and the expediency of bearing to be admonished of our faults are well recommended in this place  antony to the messenger from rome who seems to conceal ill tidings speak to me home mince not the general tongue name cleopatra as she is called in rome rail thou in fulvias fulvia wife to antony phrase and taunt my faults with such full license as both truth and malice have power to utter  oh then we bring forth weeds when our quick minds minds instead of winds warburton lie still and our ill told us is as our earing earing for ripening    in the same scene the uncertain and wavering mind of man is well described by antony upon hearing of his wifes death there is a great spirit gone thus did i desire it what our contempts do often hurl from us we wish it ours again the present pleasure by revolution lowering does become the opposite of itself the allusion is to the suns diurnal course which rising in the east and by revolution lowering or setting in the west becomes the opposite to itself  warburton  she is good being gone the hand could pull her back that shoved her on  i must from this enchanting queen break off ten thousand harms more than the ills i know my idleness does hatch   scene v here occurs one of those reflections which shakespeare abounds in upon the instability of popular favor and the simile by which he expresses himself is admirably suited to the occasion  octavius this common body like to a vagabond vagabond for floating flag upon the stream goes to and back lacqueying comparing the flag fluctuating with the ebbing and flowing of the tide to a page or lacquey following the motions of his master theobald the varying tide to rot itself with motion  act ii scene i pompey menecrates pompey if the great gods be just they shall assist the deeds of justest men  menecrates know worthy pompey that when they do delay they not deny  pompey while we are suitors to their throne decays the thing we sue for his meaning is that a gift may lose its value before it is obtained health and fortune for instance may come too late for enjoyment   menecrates we ignorant of ourselves beg often our own harms which the wise powers deny us for our good so find we profit by losing of our prayers  the above passage needs no comment except to observe upon the impatience of one of the speakers and the resignation of the other it has often surprised me to see the intemperance of mind which the generality of men are apt to betray on the ordinary course of providence whenever it happens to run counter to their interests or inclinations rather as the sentiment of menecrates delivered above renders the first expression doubtful one would fancy that such people had never laughed at the story of xerxes whipping the sea  scene v the last passage in this scene is descriptive of that natural curiosity with which jealous persons are usually affected of enquiring anxiously into every article of mind or feature relative to their rivals  cleopatra upon being informed of antonys marriage with octavia having first struck the messenger of ill news and drove him off the scene speaks thus to her women  lead me from hence  i faint  oh iras charmian  it is no matter  go to the fellow good alexas bid him report the feature of octavia her years her inclination her character or natural disposition   let him not leave out the color of her hair bring me word quickly  ex alex let him for ever go meaning antony  let him not charmian though he be painted one way like a gorgon the other ways a mars  bid you alexas bring word how tall she is  pity me charmian but speak not to me this is natural in great misfortunes we refuse comfort  lead me to my chamber queen elizabeth according to sir james melvilles report made the same kind of minute inquiries from him about her rival the queen of scots  scene vii on board pompey s vessel pompey octavius antony lopidus and menas menas aside to pompey will thou be lord of the whole world pompey how shall that be  menas thou art if thou dare be the earthly jove whatever the ocean pales or sky inclips is thine if thou will have it  pompey show me which way  menas these three

betrayed thine act  being done unknown i should have found it afterward well done but must condemn it now  the dangerous salvo which men sometimes apply to their consciences in profiting of anothers crime at free cost as they imagine is fully exposed in this scene but in morals there is no difference between the receiver and the thief and as the wages of sin are pronounced to be death in the scripture sense of the word the delinquent who accepts the emoluments of vice must expect to be included under the same sentence  act iii scene i moral writers have been distinguished into two classes of philosophy whereof one set of them are said to elevate human nature to the rank of angels while the other depreciates it to the vileness of those who had once been so but our author represents it more impartially neither inclining to one side or the other for there is not perhaps a virtue or a vice in mankind which he has not pointed out to us in the several characters he has occasionally introduced into his general drama in this scene he has afforded us an instance in the latter predicament by a description of that invidiousness with which men are apt to regard superior merit in others more especially in those talents which they are ambitious of shining in themselves  when silius advises ventidius to complete his conquest over the parthians in order to recommend himself the more eminently to the favor of antony his general the old soldier makes a reply which shows him not only to have been versed in camps but in courts also  oh silius silius i have done enough a lower place note well may make too great an act for learn this silius better to leave undone than by our deed acquire too high a fame when he we serve s away caesar octavius caesar and antony have ever won more in their officer than person sossius one of my place in syria his lieutenant for quick accumulation of renown which he achieved by the minute lost his favor  who does in the wars more than his captain can becomes his captains captain and ambition the soldiers virtue rather makes choice of loss than gain which darkens him i could do more to do antonius good but t would offend him and in his offense should my performance perish scene ii here follow two passages which for elegance of thought or beauty of expression it is not in the power of poetical imagery or language to exceed  when octavia is taking leave of her brother octavius caesar with all the shows of a tender affection antony says the aprils in her eyes it is loves spring and these the showers to bring it on be cheerful   and afterward when she endeavors to speak to him but cannot her difficulty is thus described antony her tongue will not obey her heart nor can her heart inform her tongue  the swans down feather that stands upon the swell at full of tide and neither way inclines    scene v octavius upon seeing his sister returning in a private character to rome without having afforded him timely notice to send forth a proper retinue to escort her says nay the dust should have ascended to the roof of heaven raised by your populous troops but you are come a marketmaid to rome and have prevented the ostentation of our love which left unshewn is often left unloved   there is something more to be understood in this last sentiment than can be perceived on a careless perusal of it a warm affection within naturally inspires correspondent emotions without these are a sort of setting of the jewel which not only ornaments but helps to preserve it in all the refined passions the delicacy of a sentiment insures our constancy even more than the strength of it the nice observances the petits soins which in such cases may be almost deemed petites morales also increase the mutual pleasures and confidences of love and friendship they are the comets which feed the sun even virtue itself all perfect as it is requires to be inspirited by passion for duties are but coldly performed which are but philosophically fulfilled  octavius to his sister cheer your heart  be not you troubled with the time which drives over your content these strong necessities but let determined things to destiny hold unbewaild their way here is very good advice given if by the word destiny be understood providence which must certainly have been what the ancients meant by it whenever they had any meaning about it at all for most of the heathens made use of the expression as too many christians often do of an higher one without affixing any manner of determinate idea to it in their minds but the old wiseacres were not satisfied to leave nonsense where they found it they picked up the common speech and elevated vulgar phrases into philosophical principles hence the doctrines that nature created the world and that fate governed it etc  scene vii here follows a thought which though false in the sentiment is but too true in the practice and which therefore all men should be taught to be aware of  antony taking leave of his friends after his shameful flight at actium pray ye look not sad nor make replies of loathness  take the hint which my despair proclaims let them be left which leave themselves   as my gentle readers may expect to be treated with a little of the all for love of antony in this play i shall here quote a passage relative to this subject which we meet with in the present scene  when cleopatra appears before him after his defeat which was occasioned by his quitting the sea fight at actium to pursue cleopatras galley when it was sailing away  he addresses himself to her thus o whither have thou led me egypt see how i convey my shame out of thine eyes turning from her by looking back on what i have left behind stroyed in dishonor cleopatra oh my lord my lord  forgive my fearful sails i little thought you would have followed  antony egypt thou knewst too well my heart was to thy rudder tied by the string heartstring  and thou should tow me after over my spirit thy full supremacy thou knewst and that thy beck might from the bidding of the gods command me  cleopatra oh pardon pardon weeps  antony fall not a tear i say one of them rates all that is won and lost  give me a kiss  even this repays me    shakespeare in the above instance appears to have been more galant than milton who does not suffer adam to expostulate so mildly with eve  out of my sight thou serpent  book x l      however we are to consider the infinite difference between the worlds that were lost upon those occasions but as i do not think that the first man was more excusable for following the advice than the other was for pursuing the galley of his mistress when such prizes were at stake their resentments ought to have been expressed only against themselves  scene ix the natural connection and dependence of the inward upon the outward man as it is here expressed is well marked in this place  when antony in a fit of despair goes out to pen a personal challenge to octavius the following reflection is made enobarbus yes like enough highbattled victorious caesar will unstate his happiness and be staged to the show against a sworder  i see mens judgments are a parcel of their fortunes and things outward do draw the inward quality after them to suffer all alike  that he should dream knowing all measures the full caesar will answer his emptiness  caesar thou have subdued his judgment too    in this same scene enobarbus seeing the downfall of his masters fortunes enters into debate with himself whether he shall preserve his fidelity to him still or shift about and take part with the conqueror in which soliloquy he seems fairly to give the preference to the nobler side of the question in his argument though he afterward determines against it in his conduct  but it is usually so in all deliberations of this sort for virtue and vice are of such opposite natures that there is no possibility of bringing them at all into comparison by any sophister whose judgment has not before been rendered partial and corrupt so that in such cases one may venture generally to pronounce as the poet does of women that they who deliberate are lost  enobarbus mine honesty and i begin to square to square to quarrel so used by shakespeare  the loyalty well held to fools does make our faith mere folly  yet he that can endure to follow with allegiance a fallen lord does conquer him that did his master conquer and earns a place in the story in fame or history   act iv scene v when antony is told that enobarbus had gone over to the enemy but left his chests and effects behind him he says go eros send his treasure after  do it  detain no jot i charge thee  write to him  i will subscribe gentle adieus and greetings  say that i wish he never find more cause to change a master oh my fortunes have corrupted honest men dispatch my eros   there is such an heroic liberality of soul expressed here as must make one lament the misfortunes of the unhappy antony even at this distance of time  for the fact here represented is taken from historical record we may justly say of him as the soldier does here upon delivering the message to enobarbus your emperor continues still a jove  antony was not only a braver and a greater but a better man than his competitor for empire augustus was of a worthless mean jealous and vengeful nature though poets and some historians have deified him but princes will have their flatterers milton has given one even to the prince of darkness see beelzebubs compliments to satan book iii   scene vi here enobarbus appears to have been equally struck with the generosity of his master and his own vileness upon which joint reflection he passes a very just sentence on himself  i am alone the villain of the earth and feel i am so most o antony thou mine of bounty how would thou have paid my better service when my turpitude thou do so crown with gold this blows for swells my heart if swift thought break it not a swifter mean shall outstrike thought  but thought will do it i feel i fight against thee  no i will go seek some ditch where i may die the foulst best fits my latter part of life scene viii the contrition of enobarbus was sincere for here the strong sense of his baseness bursts his swollen heart o bear me witness night be witness to me o thou blessed moon when men revolted shall upon record bear hateful memory poor enobarbus did before thy face repent o sovereign mistress of true melancholy the poisonous damp of night dispunge upon me that life a very rebel to my will may hang no longer on me i have left out a passage here which only disgraces this fine speech  o antony nobler than my revolt is infamous forgive me in thine own particular but let the world rank me in register a masterleaver and a fugitive  oh antony oh antony dies   i shall not pretend to dispute a knowledge of human nature with shakespeare but if he had not given us a representation of this character i should hardly have been brought to imagine that a breast capable of harboring such treachery and vileness could ever at the same time have contained a spirit of so much honor and so strong a sense of shame  one of the sentinels upon seeing him sink down on the ground says to his companion that he has fallen asleep but the other who had overheard his soliloquy replies very justly swoons rather for so bad a prayer as his was never yet for sleep   scene xi in this place our author describes the vicissitudes of life and the quick shiftings of fortune by an apt and beautiful simile  antony and eros antony eros thou yet beholdst me  eros ay noble lord  antony sometime we see a cloud that is dragonish a vapor sometimes like a bear or lion a towerd citadel a pendant rock a forked mountain or blue promontory with trees upon it that nod unto the world and mock our eyes with air thou st seen these signs they are black vespers pageants  eros ay my lord  antony that which is now a horse even with a thought the rack this word is explained in my last note on act iv of the tempest here it means only the dissolution of a cloud dislimns and makes it indistinct as water is in water  eros it does my lord  antony my good knave knave an old english expression for a servant or attendant  eros now thy captain is even such a body  here i am antony yet cannot hold this visible shape my knave  the rest of the speech is affecting but relates not to the description  act v scene v we meet with nothing in this act worth noting except a speech made by one of shakespeares inspired clowns in this scene  i know that a woman is a dish for the gods if the devil dress her not miltons fine compliment to the sex is only this expressed with more politeness o fairest of creation last and best of all gods works but the clowns expression has a peculiar propriety in it here as being applied to cleopatra whose vices had demonised such distinguished talents and transcendent beauty as here is  cymbeline dramatis personae men jachimo bellarius guiderius arviragus cloten pisanio lucius women imogen cymbeline act i scene viii when the insidious jachimo drops mysterious hints to the guileless imogen that he is possessed of some secret relative to her husband which he hesitates to reveal she urges him to the discovery of it in these words you do seem to know something of me or what concerns me pray you since doubting things go ill often hurts more than to be sure they do for certainties or are past remedies or timely known the remedys then born discover to me what both you spur and stop   the nature of the human mind is well shown here it presses still to know the worst of every apprehended evil though not on account of the argument above proposed which is rather ingenious than just but merely to satisfy the impatience and relieve the suspense of doubt providence has certainly a design in every kind of impression it makes upon its creatures and the reason that imogen gives here may perhaps be its true one in this case but what i contend for is that such a reflection is not the real source of our curiosity upon these occasions philosophy may serve to govern our impulses but is incapable of inspiring them  act iii scene iii the reader will require no assistance to note the morality of the reflections in the following speech as he goes along and will also be able to recollect the several observations already made upon many similar ones on the same reconciling subject in the foregoing part of this work  bellarius speaking to his two pupils guiderius and arviragus concealed princes as they are going ahunting now for our mountain sport up to yon hill your legs are young i will tread these flats  consider when you above perceive me like a crow that it is place which lessens and sets off and you may then revolve what tales i told you of courts of princes of the tricks in war where service is not service so being done but being so allowed to apprehend thus draws us a profit from all things we see and often to our comfort shall we find the sharded beetle shards are clefts in timber between which the beetle is hatched in a safer hold than is the fullwinged eagle oh this life is nobler than attending for a check richer than doing nothing for a bauble earning titles or ribbands by mean adulation or court subserviency  prouder than rustling in unpaidfor silk  such gain the cap of him that makes them fine yet keeps his book uncrossd unpaid  no life to ours   in the same scene this subject is renewed again by the same speaker with further instances and richer reflections  did you but know the citys usuries and felt them knowingly the art of the court as hard to leave as keep whose top to climb is certain falling or so slippery that the fears as bad as falling the toil of war a pain that seems to seek out danger in the name of same and honor which dies in the search and has as often a slanderous epitaph as record of fair act nay many time does ill deserve by doing well what is worse must curtsy at the censure scene iv pisanio speaking of slander says whose edge is sharper than the sword whose tongue outvenoms all the worms of nile whose breath rides on the posting winds and does belie all corners of the world kings queens and states maids matrons nay the secrets of the grave this viperous slander enters   the above passage needs no comment but what every readers experience either in his own case or that of others may enable him to supply  in the same scene which is a forest imogen upon reading her mistaken husbands mandate to pisanio requiring him to put her to death on a presumption of her having been false to his bed thus exclaims false to his bed what is it to be false to lie in watch there and to think on him to weep twixt clock and clock if sleep charge nature to break it with a fearful dream of him and cry myself awake that is false tos bed is it   nothing in situation of circumstance in thought or expression can exceed the beauty or tender effect of the above passage it catches such quick hold of our sympathy that we feel as if the scene was real and are at once transported amidst the gloom and silence of the forest in spite of all the glare of the theater and the loud applause of the audience it is in such instances as these that shakespeare has never yet been equalled and can never be excelled what a power of natural sentiment must a man have been possessed of who could so adequately express that kind of ingenuous surprise upon such a challenge which none but a woman can possibly feel shakespeare could not only assume all characters but even their sexes too  this whole scene is beautiful but falls not within our rule to transcribe any more of it here the commentators are all dumb upon this fine passage  not silent in admiration but frozen into scholastic apathy one may say of such cold critics on shakespeare what addison does of lukewarm christians that they want parts to be devout and could as soon make an epic poem as a fervent prayer  scene vii the following speech includes too many different articles in it to be comprehended under any one general head but the reader will note the several particulars of it in the perusal  imogen in boys clothes traveling alone through the forest makes this soliloquy i see a mans life is a tedious tedious for fatiguing one i have tired myself and for two nights together have made the ground my bed i should be sick but that my resolution helps me milford when from the mountain top pisanio showed thee thou wast within a ken o jove i think foundations fly the wretched such i mean where they should be relieved two beggars told me i could not miss my way will poor folks lie that have afflictions on them knowing it is a punishment or trial yes no wonder when rich ones scarce tell true to lapse in fullness is sorer than to lie for need and falsehood is worse in kings than beggars my dear lord you are one of the false ones  now i think on thee my hungers gone but even before i was at point to seek for food but what is this seeing a cave here is a path to it  it is some savage hold it were best not call  i dare not call  yet famine ere clean it oerthrow nature makes it valiant  plenty and peace breed cowards hardness ever of hardiness is mother   act iv scene iii there is a true spirit of natural bravery expressed here when cloten meets guiderius in the forest and challenges him to yield himself a prisoner he replies to whom to thee what art thou have not i an arm as big as thine a heart as big thy words i grant are bigger for i wear not my dagger in my mouth  say what thou art why i should yield to thee cloten art not afraid  guiderius those that i reverence those i fear the wise  at fools i laugh not fear them    scene iv after guiderius has slain cloten in fight his brother arviragus says he envies him the action and wishes for some such trial of danger to exercise his own spirit upon on this occasion old bellarius makes the following reflection o thou goddess thou divine nature how thyself thou blazonst in these two princely boys they are as gentle as zephyrs blowing beneath the violet not wagging his sweet head and yet as ough their royal blood enchafd as the rudest wind that by the top does take the mountain pine and make him stoop to the vale it is wonderful that an invisible instinct should frame them to royalty unlearned honor untaught civility not seen from other valor that wildly grows in them but yields a crop as if it had been sowed   the notion here expressed is one of the many ancient pieces of superstition that modern philosophy has finally destroyed the lion has long since lost its instinct for princes as well as for virgins human nature is the same throughout it is education alone that distinguishes man from man there are indeed great differences often observable between the talents and intellects of the species but this distinction is remarked in individuals only not in the classes of mankind  scene v but though i dispute the argument of bellarius in the last scene i allow him perfectly right in this one where on giving order for the funeral of cloten he says he was a queens son boys and though he came our enemy remember he was paid for that though mean and mighty rotting together have one dust yet reverence that angel of the world reverence or a due regard to subordination keeps peace and order in the world johnson  does make distinction of place twixt high and low our foe was princely and though you took his life as being our foe yet bury him as a prince   as i do not meet with any thing further in this play for my purpose except a few thoughts which are better expressed in former places already taken notice of i shall here conclude my quotations and remarks on this piece  troilus and cressida dramatis personae men agamemnon nestor ulysses achilles aeneas alexander squire to cressida women cressida troilus and cressida act i scene iii the description of ajax in this play is worth transcribing as being humorous in itself agreeing with the representation of him in the iliad and because it may be applied also in part to many and in the whole to a few medley characters that are frequently to be met with in life  alexander to cressida this man lady has robbed many beasts of their particular additions he is as valiant as the lion churlish as the bear slow as the elephant a man into whom nature has so crowded humors that his valor is crusted into folly his folly sauced with discretion there is no man has a virtue that he has not a glimpse of nor any man an attaint but he carries some stain of it he is melancholy without cause and merry against the hair he has the joints of every thing but every thing so out of joint that he is a gouty briareus many hands and no use or purblind argus all eyes and no sight  scene iv cressidas speech here in reference to her wooer troilus contains very just reflections and prudent maxims for the conduct of women in the dangerous circumstance of love what she says would become the utterance of the most virtuous matron though her own character in this piece is unluckily a bad one but our authors genius teemed so fertile in document that he was unable to restrain its impulse and coolly wait for a fit opportunity of adapting the speaker to the speech shakespeares faults arise from richness not from poverty they exceed not fall short his monsters never want a head but have sometimes two  yet hold i off  women are angels wooing things won are done joys soul lies in the doing that she beloved knows naught that knows not this men prize the thing ungained more than it is that she tha she that is the woman was never yet that ever knew love got so sweet as when desire did sue therefore this maxim out of love i teach athievement is command ungained beseech for beseeching  then though my hearts content content for capacity warburton firm love does bear nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear scene v the following dialogue can hardly be thought too long by those readers who carefully attend to the several admirable reflections comprehended in it upon the dilatory nature of great events the necessity of patience and fortitude with the expediency of deference and obedience to order and authority  a council held in the grecian camp agamemnon princes what grief has set the jaundice on your cheeks the ample proposition that hope makes in all designs begun on earth below fails in the promised largeness checks and disasters grow in the veins of actions highest reared as knots by the conflux of meeting sap infect the sound pine and divert his grain tortive and errant from his course of growth nor princes is it matter new to us that we come short of our suppose so far that after seven years siege yet troy walls stand since every action that has gone before whereof we have record trial did draw bis and thwart not answering the aim and that unbodied figure of the thought that gavt surmised shape why then ye princes do you with cheeks abashed behold our works and think them shame which are indeed naught else but the protractive trials of great jove to find persistive constancy in man the fineness of which metal is not found in fortunes love for then the bold and coward the wise and fool the artist and unread the hard and soft seem all affined and kin but in the ind and tempest of her frown distinction with a broad and powerful fan puffing at all winnows the light away and what has mass or matter by itself lies rich in virtue and unmingled  nestor in the reproof of chance lies the true proof of men the sea being smooth how many shallow bauble boats dare sail upon her patient breast making their way with those of nobler bulk but let the ruffian boreas once enrage the gentle thetis and anon behold the strongribbd bark through liquid mountains cut bounding between the two moist elements like perseus horse when he rode through the air and clouds to rescue andromeda  where is then the saucy boat whose weak untimberd sides but even now corivalld greatness  or to harbor fled or made a toast for neptune even so does valors show and valors worth divide in storms of fortune for in her ray and brightness the herd has more annoyance by the brize brize the gadfly  than by the tiger but when splitting winds make flexible the knees of knotted oaks and flies get under shade why then the thing of courage sir thomas hanmer says from his own authority that tigers are fiercest in high winds  as roused with rage with rage does sympathize and with an accent tuned in selfsame key returns to chiding fortune  ulysses troy yet upon her basis had been down and the great hectors sword had lacked a master but for these instances the speciality of rule has been neglected and look how many grecian tents do stand hollow upon this plain so many hollow factions when that the general is not like the hive to whom the foragers shall all repair what honey is expected degree being vizarded the unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask the heavens themselves the planets and this center observe degree priority and place insisture course proportion season form office and custom in all line of order and therefore is the glorious planet sol in noble eminence enthroned and sphered amidst the rest whose medcinable eye corrects the ill aspects of planets evil and posts like the commandment of a king sans check to good or bad but when the planets in evil mixture to disorder wander what plagues and what portents what mutiny what raging of the sea shaking of earth commotion in the winds frights changes horrors divest and crack rend and deracinate the unity and married calm of states quite from their fixture so when

when degree is suffocate follows the choking and this neglection of degree is it that by a pace goes backward with a purpose it has to climb the generals disdained by him one step below he by the next that next by him beneath so every step exampled by the first pace that is sick of his superior grows to an envious fever of pale and bloodless bloodless more malignant than active emulation and it is this fever that keeps troy on foot not her own sinews to end a tale of length troy in our weakness lives not in her strength  to which ulysses further on in the same scene adds they tax our policy and call it cowardice count wisdom as no member of the war forestall our prescience and esteem no act but that of hand  the still and mental parts that do contrive how many hands shall strike when fitness calls them on and know the measure by their observant toil of the enemys weight why this has not a fingers dignity they call this bedwork mappery closetwar  so that the ram that batters down the wall for the great swing and rudeness of its poize they place before his hand that made the engine or those that with the fierceness of their souls by reason guide its execution   may i venture here to challenge any thing in the iliad where the same argument is deliberated upon by the same chiefs with homers gods to assist their counsels to equal the justness of observation the richness of imagery and the copiousness of reflection presented to us in this resplendent passage but as i said before on a comparison between shakespeare and sophocles it is enough to determine the literary critics against me that one had written in english and the other in greek  scene vi in this place is given us a specimen of the ancient chivalry as first inspired by love and galantry and exercised in honor or defense of women aeneas attended by an herald bringing a challenge from hector to any champion in the grecian camp who will accept it delivers himself thus kings princes lords if there be one amongst the fairest of greece that holds his honor higher than his ease that seeks his praise more than he fears his peril that knows his valor and knows not his fear that loves his mistress more than in profession with truant vows to her own lips he loves and dare avow her beauty and her worth in other arms than hers to him this challenge  hector in view of trojans and of greeks shall make it good or do his best to do it he has a lady wiser fairer truer than ever greek did compass in his arms and will tomorrow with his trumpet call midway between your tents and wall of troy to rouse a grecian that is true in love  if any come hector shall honor him if none he will say in troy when he retires the grecian dames are sunburned and not worth the splinter of a lance even so much   to which agamemnon replies this shall be told our lovers lord aeneas  if none of them have soul in such a kind we have left them all at home but we are soldiers and may that soldier a mere recreant prove that means not has not or is not in love if then one is or has or means to be that one meets hector  if none else i am he   old nestors speech upon this occasion is well worth adding here both for the humor of his expressions and to complete the idea of knighterrantry in which profession of arms neither difference of age or other imparity whatsoever were allowed to be pleaded as exemptions by the laws of such romantic chivalry  tell him of nestor one that was a man when hectors grandsire sucked he is old now but if there be not in our grecian host one noble man that has one spark of fire to answer for his love tell him from me i will hide my silver beard in a gold beaver and in my vantbrace put this withered brawn and meeting him will tell him that my lady was fairer than his grandam and as chaste as may be in the world  his youth in flood i will pawn this truth with my three drops of blood act ii scene viii the last passage in this scene contains a good stricture against pride though somewhat too quaintly expressed in the first and last part of the proposition  vantbrace a shield or buckler agamemnon he that is proud eats up himself pride is his own glass his own trumpet his own chronicle and whatever praises itself but in the deed devours the deed in the praise  of all the faults of men their pride is apt to give us most offense perhaps because it hurts our own i am not sure but this has been said by somebody else before    act iii scene vii the following speech may very well take ecce mundum for its motto as it is full of melancholy and mortifying truths but i dont think the philosophic and humiliating reflections it contains become the character of the speaker as given us by homer achilles on seeing the grecian chiefs pass by his tent without taking notice of him says to patroclus what am i poor of late it is certain greatness once fallen out with fortune must fall out with men too what the declined is he shall as soon read in the eyes of others as feel in his own fall for men like butterflies show not their mealy wings but to the summer and not a man for being simply man has any honor but honor by those honors that are without him as place riches favor prizes of accident as often as merit which when they fall as being slippery standers the love that leaned on them as slippery too does one pluck down another and together die in the fall   in the latter end of the same scene the investigating faculties necessary for a minister with the arcana imperii or mysteries of government are strongly and poetically described  ulysses the providence that is in a watchful state knows almost every grain of plutos gold acquainted with all the resources of trade commerce or finances  finds bottom in the incomprehensive deep keeps place with thought and almost like the gods does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles there is a mystery with which relation recital explanation or comment  durst never meddle in the soul of state which has an operation more divine than breath or pen can give expressure to  romeo and juliet dramatis personae men romeo benvolio friar lawrence women none romeo and juliet were it my province to have selected the poetical beauties of our author there are few of his plays that would have furnished me more amply than this the language abounds with tenderness and delicacy and seems to breathe the soul of youthful fondness but neither the fable nor the dialogue can afford much assistance toward my present purpose as the first is founded on a vicious prejudice unknown to the liberal minds of britons that of entailing family feuds and resentments down from generation to generation and the second as far at least as the lovers are concerned though poetical and refined is dictated more by passion than by sentiment  but as my young readers might not forgive my passing over this play unnoticed i shall just observe that the catastrophe of the unhappy lovers seems intended as a kind of moral as well as poetical justice for their having ventured upon an unweighed engagement together without the concurrence and consent of their parents see my reflection on the first scene act i midsummer nights dream where this duty and obedience is both enforced and restrained  act i scene ii the first passage worthy of remark that occurs is the following definition or description of that passion which with respect to the generality of mankind frames the happiness or misery of their lives  romeo and benvolio benvolio alas that love so gentle in his view should be so tyrannous and rough in proof  romeo why then o brawling love o loving hate oh any thing of nothing first create o heavy lightness serious vanity misshapen chaos of wellseeming forms feather of lead bright smoke cold fire sick health still waking sleep that is not what it is love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs being purged a fire sparkling in lovers eyes being vexed a sea nourished with lovers tears  what is it else a madness most discreet a choking gall and a preserving sweet  act ii scene iii the allegory here drawn from a comparison of the qualities of herbs with the nature of man is just ingenious and poetical  enter friar lawrence with a basket in order to cull simples for medicinal uses  the greyeyed morn smiles on the frowning night checkring the eastern clouds with streaks of light and darkness fleckered like a drunkard reels from forth days path and titans burning wheels now ere the sun advance his burning eye the day to cheer and nights dank dew to dry i must fill up this osiercage of ours with baleful weeds and preciousjuiced flowers the earth that is natures mother is her tomb what is her burying grave that is her womb and from her womb children of diverse kind we sucking on her natural bosom find many for many virtues excellent none but for some and yet all different o mickle is the powerful grace that lies in plants herbs stones and their true qualities nor naught so vile that on the earth does live but to the earth some special good does give nor aught so good but strained from that fair use revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse virtue itself turns vice being misapplied and vice sometimes by actions dignified within the infant rind of this small flower poison has residence and medicine power for this being smelt with that sense cheers each part being tasted slays all senses with the heart two such opposed fees encamp them still in man as well as herbs grace and rude will and where the worser is predominant fullsoon the canker death eats up that plant in the same scene when romeo comes to acquaint the friar that his former flame for the fair rosaline is extinct this hint of romeos infidelity is left out in the modern representation of this play  and a new one for juliet like another phoenix had arisen out of its ashes the honest priest thus exclaims holy st francis what a change is here is rosaline whom thou did love so dear so soon forsaken young mens love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes holy st francis what a deal of brine has washed thy sallow cheeks for rosaline how much salt water thrown away in waste to season love that of it does not taste the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears lo here upon thy cheek the stain does sit of an old tear that is not washed off yet  if ever thou wast thyself and these woes thine thou and these woes were all for rosaline and art thou changed pronounce this sentence then women may fall when there is no strength in men   with this very just reflection i shall here conclude my notes upon this play the remainder of it affording but little matter for further observation being mostly action narration and confusion but if my readers should require some apology to be made for the quick conception of passion in the character of juliet i must refer them to my preface to scene iv act i of the taming of the shrew  hamlet dramatis personae men hamlet king polonius laertes horatio rosincrantz reynoldo women queen ophelia players hamlet act i scene ii if reasoning could control our grief the king and queen offer sufficient arguments to hamlet in this scene to moderate his  good hamlet cast thy nighted color off and let thine eyes look like a friend on denmark do not for ever with thy veiled lids seek for thy noble father in the dust thou know it is common all that live must die passing through nature to eternity the king then takes up the subject and enlarges on it  it is sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to give these mourning duties to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father his and the survivor bound in filial obligation for some term to do obsequious the word here is framed from obsequies or funeral rites johnson sorrow but to persevere in obstinate condolement condolement for sorrow because it requires condolement warburton  is a course of impious stubbornness unmanly grief it shows a will most incorrect to heaven a heart unfortified a mind impatient an understanding simple and unschoold for what we know must be and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sense why should we in our peevish opposition take it to heart fie it is a fault to heaven a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theme is death of fathers and who still have cried from the first corse till he that died today this must be so scene v in this scene laertes gives most excellent advice and matronly caution to his sister upon the subject of hamlets addresses to her  for hamlet and the trifling of his favor hold it a fashion and a toy in blood a violet in the youth of primy nature forward not permanent though sweet not lasting the perfume and suppliance of a minute  no more think it no more for nature crescent does not grow alone in thews thews and bulk synonimous and bulk but as this temple waxes the inward service of the mind and soul grows wide withal perhaps he loves you now and now no soil nor cautel cael this wrd from the latin cautela signifies simply caution but by the abuse of languge is thught here to mean  does besmirch the virtue of his will but you must fear then weigh what loss your honor may sustain if with too credent ear you list his songs or lose your heart or your chaste treasure open to his unmastered importunity fear it ophelia fear it my dear sister and keep within the rear of your affection out of the shot and danger of desire the chariest maid is prodigal enough if she unmask her beauty to the moon virtue itself escapes not calumnious strokes the canker galls the infants of the spring too often before their buttons button or grmen of a plant be disclosed and in the morn and liquid dew of youth contagious blasments are most eminent  be wary then best safety lies in fear yth to itself rebels though none else near scene vi polonius on his sons going to travel gives him admirable rules and instructions for his conduct in life  my blessing with you and these few precepts in thy memory see thou character give thy thoughts no tongue nor any unproportioned thought his act be thou familiar but by no means vulgar the friends thou have and their adoption tried grapple them to thy soul with clasps of steel but do not dull thy palm with entertainment of each newhatchd unfledged comrade beware of entrance to a quarrel but being in beart that the opposer may beware of thee give every man thine ear but few thy voice take each mans censure but reserve thy judgment costly thy habit as thy purse can buy but not expressed in fancy rich not gaudy for the apparel often proclaims the man neither a borrower nor a lender be for borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry and loan often loses both itself and friend i have ventured to transpose these two lines to avoid confusion in the argument  this above all  to thine own self be true and it must follow as the light the day the text says the night the day  warburton has made the alteration much to the advantage of the passage  thou can not then be false to any man in the continuation of this scene polonius renews the same topic with his daughter that her brother had begun with her in the former which is urged with higher authority and enforced by additional arguments i shall give the dialogue as it stands  polonius what is it ophelia he has said to you laertes  ophelia so please you something touching the lord hamlet  polonius marry well bethought it is told me he has very often of late given private time to you and you yourself have of your audience been most free and bounteous if it be so as so it is put on me and that in way of caution i must tell you you do not understand yourself so clearly as it behooves my daughter and your honor what is between you give me up the truth  ophelia he has my lord of late made many tender of his affection to me  polonius affection pugh you speak like a green girl unsifted in such perilous circumstance do you believe his tenders as you call them  ophelia i do not know my lord what i should think  polonius marry i will teach you think yourself a baby that you have taken his tenders for true pay which are not sterling tender yourself more dearly or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase wronging it thus you will tender me a fool  ophelia my lord he has importuned me with love in honorable fashion  polonius ay fashion you may call t  go to go to  ophelia and has given countenance to his speech my lord with almost all the holy vows of heaven  polonius ay springes to catch woodcocks i do know when the blood burns how prodigal the soul lends the tongue vows these blazes oh my daughter giving more light than heat extinct in both even in the promise as it is a making you must not take for fire from this time be somewhat scantier of thy maiden presence set your intreatments at an higher rate than a command to parley for lord hamlet believe so much in him that he is young and with a larger tether with a freer scope he may walk than may be given you in few ophelia do not believe his vows for they are brokers not of that die which their investments show but mere implorers of unholy suits breathing like sanctified and pious bawds bawds instead of bands theobald this alteration gives an obvious sense to the passage and saves the expense of a comment with which a text should never be encumbered unless it may no otherwise be rendered intelligible  the better to beguile this is for all  i would not in plain terms from this time forth have you so slander any moments leisure as to give words or talk with the lord hamlet look to t i charge you  scene vii i shall here quote what hamlet says against the vice of drinking as it may suit the latitude of england as well as that of denmark  horatio is it a custom  hamlet ay marry is t but to my mind though i am native here and to the manner born it is a custom more honored in the breach than the observance this heavyheaded revel east and west makes us traduced and taxed of other nations they clepe us drunkards and with swinish phrase soil our addition and indeed it takes from our achievements though performed at height the pith and marrow of our attribute as our natural bravery is often imputed to our potvaliantry   from hence the speaker takes occasion to extend his reflection into a general observation which most peoples experience may enable them to support that some accidental peculiarity of mind of manners nay even of features have often hurt the characters and marred the fortunes of particular persons of intrinsic worth and merit  so often it chances in particular men that for some vicious mole of nature in them as in their birth wherein they are not guilty since nature cannot choose his origin by the oergrowth of some complexion constitutional predominance  often breaking down the pales and forts of reason or by some habit that too much oerleavens the form of plausive manners that these men carrying i say the stamp of one defect being natures livery or fortunes scar their virtues else be they as pure as grace as infinite as man may undergo shall in the general censure take corruption from that particular fault the dram of base does all the noble substance of worth out to his own scandal i shall leave the reader to interpret this last passage to himself for though theobald has amended the text so as to hint the meaning the sense of it is still left imperfect in the expression  scene viii there is something extremely remarkable and pleasing in the following part of the ghosts speech to hamlet here  but howsoever thou pursust this act taint not thy mind nor let thy soul contrive against thy mother aught leave her to heaven and to those thorns that in her bosom lodge to prick and sting her he repeats the same fond caution to him again in act iii scene x  but look amazement on thy mother sits o step between her and her fighting soul conceit in weakest bodies strongest works  speak to her hamlet no eastern sentiment inspired by the first beams of the sun and refined by the sublimest morality of confucius ever rose to so high a pitch as the tenderness expressed in these two passages toward his wife  even after her crimes have either the greek or latin masters of the epic afforded us so beautiful an instance of forgiveness and of love subsisting even beyond the grave they have both of them presented us with scenes after death but compare the behavior of dido upon meeting aeneas in the elysian fields with this as being the most parallel passage i can recollect he had not been any thing near so culpable toward her as this queen had been to her husband and yet the utmost temper that the heathen poet could bring his ghost to upon that occasion was merely to be silent and not upbraid in speech though he makes her sufficiently mark her resentment by her looks and behavior  act ii scene i here polonius gives some instructions to a person he is sending over to carry money to his son at paris in which though he requires him to sift narrowly into the manner of life company and conversation of laertes yet he does it with so becoming a tenderness and parental respect to the character of the young man as is extremely interesting and engaging  polonius and reynoldo polonius you shall do mavelous wisely good reynoldo before you visit him to make inquiry of his behavior  reynoldo my lord i did intend it  polonius marry well said  very well said  look you sir inquire me first what danskers danes are in paris  and how and who  what means  and where they keep what company at what expense and finding by this encompassment and drift of question that they do know my son come you more near then your particular demands will touch it  take you as twere some distant knowledge of him as thus i know his father and his friends and in part him  do you mark this reynoldo  reynoldo ay very well my lord  polonius and in part him  but you may say not well but if t be he i mean he s very wild addicted so and so  and there put on him what forgeries you please  marry none so rank as may dishonor him  take heed of that  but sir such wanton wild and usual slips as are companions noted and most known to youth and liberty  scene ii polonius it seems it is as proper to our age to cast beyond ourselves in our opinions as it is common for the younger sort to lack discretion  upon this reflection doctor johnson says this is not the remark of a weak man it is not indeed but why should polonius be deemed so he certainly speaks very good sense throughout though with the natural and respectable mixture of the old man in it which methinks as addison says of cornaros he wrote a treatise on health and long life at fourscore commended in the spectator no     style is an improvement to it as to the manner in which he describes hamlets madness in scene iv following i take it to be only designed by shakespeare in ridicule of the old pedantic mode of definitions or quaint distinctions in logic and philosophy the categories predicaments and predicables of the schools used in those times there are many instances of the same oblique strictures upon other subjects in our author i have therefore ever thought this character mistaken and consequently misrepresented on the stage by its being generally given to a comic actor  act iii scene ii the famous soliloquy of hamlet here to be or not to be is so generally remembered and has been so often remarked upon that i might possibly be thought guilty of a neglect in passing it by without a comment but the subject is a hazardous one and therefore had better not be meddled with it might perhaps bear a discussion in philosophy but religion forbids any manner of debate upon it  scene iii shakespeare not only affords documents to real life but supplies them even to the mimic one as may be seen in this scene where he makes hamlet give instructions to actors how they should perform their parts but as there is no moral to be extracted from the passage i shall not quote it here  but all these rules however excellent in themselves may be considered rather as strictures on bad performers than precepts for their reformation actors like poets must be born not made and a receipt to form an actor may be considered in the same light with the one to frame an epic poem it is not so much from want of notion as of nature that so many of the dramatis personae are found to be deficient in the expression of sentiment and representation of character  talents are as necessary to actors as genius is to authors if i may be allowed such a distinction of terms  but neither are to be acquired in the schools all mr garricks art without his nature would produce no effect as may be seen in the many who have laboriously but vainly attempted to copy him i have known persons capable of writing a part who were incapable of performing it our author himself was an instance of this inconsistency who though he formed the rule could not supply the example  scene vi in the strollers play here introduced where the lady is said to protest too much the speech which the duke her husband makes upon that occasion shows a perfect knowledge in the mind and manners of human nature  i do believe you think what now you speak but what we do determine often we break purpose is but the slave of memory of violent birth but poor validity which now like fruits unripe sticks on the tree but fall unshaken when they mellow be most necessary it is that we forgot to pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt this sentiment is improperly expressed but the meaning of the passage is that we think we may remit engagements made only to ourselves without a strain of conscience  what to ourselves in passion we propose the passion ending does the purpose lose the violence of either grief or joy their own enactures with themselves destroy where joy most revels grief does most lament grief joys joy grieves on slender accident this world is not for aye nor is it strange that even our loves should with our fortunes change for it is a question left us yet to prove whether love leads fortune or else fortune love the great man down you mark his favorite flies the poor advanced makes friends of enemies and hitherto does love on fortune tend for who not needs shall never lack a friend and who in want a hollow friend does try directly seasons him his enemy but orderly to end where i begun our wills and fates do so contrary run that our devices still are overthrown our thoughts are ours their ends none of our own scene vii there is something very affecting in the selfexpostulation entered into by hamlet in this place just before he proceeds to hold the conference with his mother soft now to my mother  o heart lose not thy nature let not ever the soul of nero enter this firm bosom let me be cruel cruel for sever  but not unnatural i will speak daggers to her but use none my tongue and soul in this be hypocrites how in my words soever she be shent shent sentenced or condemned  to give them seals to give them warrant or authority to execute justice  never my soul consent   the filial tenderness here expressed toward her is in the same generous strain with the conjugal one before taken notice of in the ghosts speech but howsoever thou pursuest this act etc  scene viii upon the kings expressing an apprehension of some commotion in the state which might arise from hamlets madness rosincrantz makes the following speech the single and peculiar life is bound with all the strength and armor of the mind to keep itself from noyance but much more that spirit on whose weal depends and rests the lives of many the cease of majesty dies not alone but like a gulf does draw what is near it with it it is a massy wheel fixed on the summit of the highest mount to whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things are mortified and adjoined which when it falls each small annexment petty consequence attends the boisterous ruin never alone did the king sigh but with a general groan   the reflections in the above speech contain a very just and political moral in them which ought to be opposed to all rebellious motions that may ever arise in the minds of a discontented people if after such a pause of deliberation it shall fail of producing its proper effect there must be sufficient cause to suspect that the private advantage of individuals is more intended than the general one of the community i do not mean to plead here for the old and justly exploded doctrines of passive obedience and nonresistance but only to hint a distinction between reason and resentment between rebellion and defense  the following speech in the same scene will supply its own reflections and morals without the assistance of a comment  king oh my offense is rank it smells to heaven pray i cannot though inclination be as sharp ast will my stronger guilt defeats my strong intent and like a man to double business bound i stand in pause where i shall first begin and both neglect what if this cursed hand were thicker than itself with brothers blood is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens to wash it white as snow whereto serves mercy but to confront the visage of offense and what is in prayer but this twofold force to be forestalled ere we come to fall or pardoned being down then i will look up my fault is past but oh what form of prayer can serve my turn forgive me my foul murder that cannot be since i am still possessed of those effects for which i did the murder my crown mine own ambition and my queen may one be pardoned and retain the offense in the corrupted currents of this world offences gilded hand may shove by justice and often it is seen the wicked prize itself buys out the law  but it is not so above there is no shuffling there the action lies in his true nature and we ourselves compelled even to the teeth and forehead of our faults to give in evidence what then what rests try what repentance can what can it not yet what can it when one cannot repent that is show their penitence sincere by making restitution  oh wretched state o bosom black as death oh limed soul that struggling to be free art more engaged help angels make assay bow stubborn knees and heart with strings of steel be soft as sinews of the newborn babe all may be well  kneels  after some time he rises and says my words fly up my thoughts remain below words without thoughts will never to heaven go   scene x in the latter end of the conference between hamlet and his mother he makes a speech upon the power of custom which should be engraved on our hearts and be the matin soliloquy of our lives  good night but go not to mine uncles bed assume a virtue if you have it not that monster custom who all sense does eat of habits devil is angel yet in this that to the use of actions fair and good he likewise gives a frock or livery that aptly is put on refrain tonight and that shall lend a kind of easiness to the next abstinence the next more easy for use can almost change the stamp of nature and master even the devil or throw him out with wondrous potency act iv scene iv the following speech of hamlet contains a very philosophic reflection and is the proper sentiment of men who are not brutes in their nature and deserve to perish like them  what is a man if his chief good and market of his time be but to sleep and feed a beast no more sure he that made us with such large discourse with such investigating powers and faculties of reasoning  looking before and after gave us not that capability and godlike reason to fust in us unused scene v when the queen suffers ophelia in her madness to be admitted to her presence lest her pitiable condition might raise a tumult in the city she makes this soliloquy let her come in  to my sick soul as sins true nature is each toy seems prologue to some great amiss so full of artless jealousy is guilt it spills itself in fearing to be spilt a tainted conscience as the proverb says in other words is apt to betray itself    act v scene iv here follows the description of an obsequious empty but imposing character such as is frequently to be met with in life mostly in courts or among those who by a modern unmeaning title are styled the ton  vox et praeterea nihil virtue and vice sense and folly are the only just natural or adequate differences in mankind these made the first distinctions between men and ought still to preserve them   hamlet speaking of osrick  he did compliment with his dug before he sucked it thus has he and many more of the same breed that i know the drossy age dotes on only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter a kind of yesty from yest or harm in general it means spumy or frothy collection which carries them through and through the most fanned and winnowed opinions and do but blow them to their trials the bubbles are out  in the same scene just before his going to engage with laertes on the trial of skill hamlet hints at one of those forebodings frequent in the human mind and already remarked upon in former places  hamlet to horatio thou would not think how ill all is here about my heart  but it is no matter  horatio nay my good lord   hamlet it is but foolery but it is such a kind of gaingiving gaingiving for misgiving a most extraordinary kind of synonima and only met with here  as would perhaps trouble a woman   horatio if your mind dislike any thing obey it i will forestal their repair hither and say you are not fit   to which the gallant hamlet replies with a manly and philosophic spirit hamlet not a whit we defy augury there is a special providence in the fall of a sparrow pope seems to have borrowed a hint from this passage where he says speaking of providence who sees with equal eye as lord of all a hero perish or a sparrow fall   if it be now it is not to come if it be not to come it will be now if it be not now yet it will come the readiness is all since no man knows aught of what he leaves what is it to leave betimes     this is in my opinion a much better speech than the one that julius caesar makes in our authors play under that title cowards die many times before their death etc  postscript shaftsbury speaking of hamlet says that piece of shakespeares which appears to have most affected english hearts and has perhaps been oftenest acted of any that have come upon our stage is almost one continued moral a series of deep reflections drawn from one mouth upon the subject of one single accident and calamity naturally fitted to move horror and compassion  it may be said of this play if i mistake not that it has properly but one character or principal part it contains no adoration or flattery of the sex no ranting at the gods no blustering heroism nor any thing of that curious mixture of the fierce and tender which makes the hinge of modern tragedy and nicely varies it between the points of love and honor  othello dramatis personae men duke of venice othello cassio iago brabantio rodorigo women desdemona aemilia othello shakespeare has written three pieces on the subject of jealousy the winters tale cymbeline and this one besides the character of ford in the merry wives but such was the richness of his genius that he has not borrowed a single thought image or expression from any one of them to assist him in any of the others the subject seems rather to have grown progressively out of itself to have inspired its own sentiments and have dictated its own language this play in my opinion is very justly considered as the last and greatest effort of our authors genius and may therefore be looked upon as the chef doeuvre of dramatic composition  how perfectly does othellos conduct throughout correspond with iagos description of it in the latter end of the first act  the moor is of a free and open nature that thinks men honest who but seem to be so such a character is not uncommon in life whose virtues arising more from an excellence of nature than an exertion of philosophy is led to judge of others by itself and of course become the dupe of art and villainy  act i scene iv othello here expresses a very just and liberal sense of a matrimonial connection  but that i love the gentle desdemona i would not my unhoused free condition put into circumscription and confine for the seas worth scene ix the argument between philosophy and feeling in cases of misfortune or grief is well debated here the duke preaching patience to the father upon his daughters elopement with the moor says good brabantio take up this mangled matter at the best men do their broken weapons rather use than their bare hands when remedies are past the griefs are ended by seeing the worst which late on hope depended to mourn a mischief that is lost and gone is the next way to draw new mischief on what cannot be preserved when fortune takes patience her injury a mockery makes the robbed that smiles steals something from the thief he robs himself who spends a bootless grief brabantio so let the turk of cyprus us beguile we lose it not so long as we can smile he bears the sentence well who nothing bears but the free comfort which from thence he hears alluding to the homily usually made by a judge on passing sentence  but he bears both the sentence and the sorrow that to pay grief must of poor patience borrow these sentences to sugar or to gall being strong on both sides are equivocal but words are words i never yet did hear that the bruised heart was healed through the ear    i may possibly be reprehended by some severe moralists for noting the equipoise of such an argument as this in this instance indeed i confess that i act contrary to the usual tenor of document which always takes part on the wise side of a question but as i have said before last part of postscript to julius caesar with other passages referred to in the notes  i do not think that ethic philosophy can ever be a gainer by overstraining the sinews of the human mind we ought neither to be votaries to the cynic nor the stoic sects we should not with diogenes follow nature in the mere animal sense of the expression nor with zeno fly beyond it in the metaphysical one true virtue has no extremes its sphere extends not beyond the temperate zones it sleeps in the frozen and but raves in the torrid ones  scene x i have before observed upon the exuberance of shakespeares document and moral he so much abounds in maxim and reflection that he appears frequently at a loss to find proper characters throughout even his own extensive drama sufficient to parcel them out to so that he is frequently obliged to make his fools talk sense and set his knaves apreaching an instance of the latter impropriety may be seen in the following passage which contains both sound philosophy and useful admonition but that it may have the better effect on my readers i wish that whenever they remember the speech they could contrive to forget the speaker  rodorigo what should i do i confess it is my shame to be so fond but it is not in my virtue to amend it   iago virtue a fig it is in ourselves that we are thus or thus our bodies are our gardens to the which our wills are gardeners so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many either have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our will if the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions   the plea that rodorigo offers above for remaining still under the dominion of a lawless passion is framed upon a fatal error too prevalent in the world that virtue is a peculiar gift from heaven granted speciali gratia as it were to particular and chosen persons hence indolent minds are apt to conclude it a vain task to restrain their passions or resist their temptations without the supernatural aid of such an innate endowment iago in his reply reasons very justly against this dangerous and discouraging doctrine of partial grace in support of which argument i shall here add a passage from a modern writer who speaking on this subject says the difficulties we apprehend more than those we find in the strife with all our passions is the only thing that prevents philosophy or virtue from being commonly attainable in general life what makes the difference between a chaste woman and a frail one the one had struggled and the other not between a brave man and a coward the one had struggled and the other not an honest man and a knave one had struggled the other not the posthumous works of a late celebrated genius deceased   act ii scene xiv there is a good deal of afterwit reflection here which however may serve as a forewarning perhaps to some of my readers iago seeing cassio desponding on being cashiered by othello asks if he be hurt to which he replies cassio past all surgery  reputation reputation reputation oh i ave lost the immortal part of me and what remains is bestial oh thou invisible spirit of wine if thou have no name to be known by let us call thee devil  i will ask him for my post again and he shall tell me i am a drunkard had i as many mouths as hydra such an answer would stop them all to be now a sensible man by and by a fool and presently a beast every inordinate cup is unblessed and the ingredient is a devil     act iii scene v the following passage will speak for itself iago good name in man or woman dear my lord is the immediate jewel of their souls who steals my purse steals trash it is something nothing twas mine it is his and has been slave to thousands but he that filches from me my good name robs me of that which not enriches him and makes me poor indeed    in the same scene othello while his alarmed mind is struggling between confidence and conviction delivers himself on the subject with a liberal and manly spirit  think thou i would make a life of jealousy to follow still the changes of the moon with fresh suspicions no  to be once in doubt is once to be resolved exchange me for a goat when i shall turn the business of my soul to such exsuffolate exsuffolate buzzing and blown surmises he compares these whispered slanders to waterbubbles floating in the air  matching thy inference it is not to make me jealous to say my wife is fair feeds well loves company is free of speech sings plays and dances well where virtue is these are most virtuous nor from mine own weak merits will i draw the smallest fear or doubt of her revolt for she had eyes and chose me no iago i will see before i doubt when i doubt prove and on the proof there is no more but this away at once with love or jealousy scene xii it has often surprised me to find the character of desdemona so much mistaken and slighted as it too generally is it is simple indeed but that is one of its merits for the simplicity of it is that of innocence not of folly in my opinion she seems to be as perfect a model of a wife as either this author or any other writer could possibly have framed she speaks little but whatever she says is sensible pure and chaste the remark she makes in this place on the alteration of othellos manners toward her affords a very proper admonition to all women in her situation and circumstances  something sure of state has puddled his clear spirit and in such cases mens natures wrangle with inferior things though great ones are their object it is even so  for let our finger ache and it endues our other healthful members with a sense of pain nay we must think men are not gods nor of them look for such observance always as fits the bridal she had said to himself before be it as your fancies teach you  whatever you be i am obedient   and afterward in confessing herself before iago and aemilia here i kneel  if ever my will did trespass against his love or it discourse or thought or actual deed or that mine eyes mine ears or any sense delight thn on any other form or that i  and ever did and ever will ough he do shake me off to beggarly divorcement love him dearly comfort forswear me unkindness may do much and  unkindness may defeat my life but never  love   and further on where aemilia says to her of othello i wish you had never seen him she replies so would not i my love does so approve him that even hi stubbornnes his checks and frowns have grace and favor in them   as the married state is both the dearest and most social connection of life i think this a proper passage to conclude my observations with on a work in which is comprehended the compleatest system of the oeconomical and moral duties of human nature that perhaps was ever framed by the wisdom philosophy or experience of uninspired man  a general postscript there are many favorite passages in shakespeare which most of my readers have got by heart and missing here may possibly object to my having neglected to quote or observe upon them in their proper places but my intention in this work was not to propound the beauties of the poet but to expound the document of the moralist throughout his writings  so far from being insensible to the other excellencies of this author i have ever thought him by much the greatest poet of our nation for sublimity of idea and beauty of expression perhaps i may even think myself guilty of some injustice in limiting his fame within the narrow confines of these kingdoms for upon a comparison with the much venerated names of antiquity i am of opinion that we need not surrender the british palm either to the grecian bay or the roman laurel with regard to the principal parts of poetry as thought sentiment or description  and though the dead languages are confessed to be superior to ours yet even here in the very article of diction our author shall measure his pen with any of the ancient styles in their most admired compound and decompound epithets descriptive phrases or figurative expressions the multitudinous sea earpiercing fife big war giddy mast skyaspiring heavenkissing hill timehonoured name cloudcapt towers heavenlyharnessed team rash gunpowder polished perturbation gracious silence golden care trumpettongued thoughtexecuting fires with a number of other words both epic and comic are instances of it but with regard to the moral excellencies of our english confucius either for beauty or number he undoubtedly challenges the wreath from the whole collective host of greek or roman writers whether ethic epic dramatic didactic or historic  mrs montagu says very justly that we are apt to consider shakespeare only as a poet but he is certainly one of the greatest moral philosophers that ever lived and this is true because in his universal scheme of doctrine he comprehends manners proprieties and decorums and whatever relates to these to personal character or national description falls equally within the great line of morals horace prefers homer to all the philosophers qui quid sit pulchrum quid turpe quid utile quid non before et melius chrysippo et crantore dicit and surely shakespeare before et melius excels him again as much as the living scene exceeds the dead letter as action is preferable to didaction or representation to declamation  example is better than precept a dramatic moral affords us the benefit of both at once plato wished that virtue could assume a visible form dramatic exhibition gives one both to virtue and to vice the abstract idea is there materialized the contrast of character too affords an additional strength to the moral as we are led to love virtue on a double account by being made to abhor vice at the same time the dramatic moralist possesses a manifest advantage over the doctrinal one mere descriptions of virtue or vice do not strike us so strongly as the visible representations of them richard the thirds dream lady macbeths soliloquy in her sleep the dagger scene in the same play cardinal beauforts last moments with many other passages in our author of the same admonitory kind avail us more than whole volumes of tullys offices or senecas morals  in this scenic province of instruction our representations are much better calculated to answer the end proposed than those of the ancients were on account of the different hours of exhibition theirs were performed in the morning which circumstance suffered the salutary effect to be worn out of the mind by the business or avocations of the day ours are at night the impressions accompany us to our couch supply matter for our latest reflections and may sometimes furnish the subject of our very dreams  but shakespeare seems to have extended his views still further by frequently interspersing allusions to the scriptures throughout his writings i would not have the old mysteries restored to the stage nor should dramatic dialogue exceed into sermons but i think that such occasional hints or passages as this author has supplied when thrown in sparingly and introduced with discretion may sometimes serve to add a strength and dignity to the style and subject of such compositions besides the advantage of producing perhaps effects of an higher nature by calling our attention to more serious reflections in the very midst of our pleasures and dissipations without sinking our spirits or damping our enjoyments awakening us to the contemplation of a religion so pure so equally free from the severities of discipline and the superstitions of devotion of a system of theology framed even as man himself would choose in fine of a faith and doctrine which has but stronger bound the social ties given an higher sanction to moral obligations and proved our duty to be our interest also  having now arrived at the last page of my task i must confess the apprehensions i am sensible of on presenting to the public a work of so much difficulty and danger though with regard to the first of these articles i acknowledge this to have been one in the class of those of which ferdinand in the tempest says there be some sports are painful but their labor delight in them sets off but in respect to the latter i must here throw myself not only upon the candor but the indulgence of my readers hoping that the many failures in the execution may be pardoned on the single merit of the design  the end
