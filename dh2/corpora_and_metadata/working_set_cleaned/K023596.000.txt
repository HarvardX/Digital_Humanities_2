a treatise on the extraction of the cataract  by frederick bishoff fms oculist to his majesty in the electorate of hanover and to her majesty in england  london printed by w bulmer and co and sold by g nicol pall mall        to john heaviside esquire surgeon extraordinary to his majesty sir the friendship with which you have honored me during my residence in london for these two years past could not fail to impress me with the most lively sense of gratitude  in the course of this time you have done me the honor of being present at some operations which i have performed  your extensive knowledge and professional abilities are so generally known that it is out of my power to enlarge on your merits  i trust that you will accept the dedication of the following sheets as a small token of the great esteem with which i am  sir your most obedient humble servant frederick bischoff grosvenor street may      introduction it may not be unnecessary to state in this brief address the tenor of the present treatise and the reasons which led to its publication  it is not meant to contain either a systematical description of all the species of the cataract or an explanation of all the different methods of performing the operation the intention of the writer is simply to explain to the young surgeon the extraction of the cataract and that in a way so familiar and intelligible as to induce him to adopt the operation in his practice  professional men it has been found and even those of acknowledged abilities have sometimes shrunk from this operation on account of the peculiar difficulties with which it is attended the consequence has been that the person afflicted by this disease has been compelled to apply either to some traveling oculist who is seldom much interested in the welfare of his patient or else to some empiric by whom every case is undertaken merely because his confidence is equal to his ignorance  another reason for this publication is that some of the particularities of the authors method have already been made the topic of conversation but verbal communications of this nature being always vague and liable to be mistaken it was his opinion that on a subject at once so delicate and so important nothing should be left to uncertainty  many excellent works have been produced and by celebrated names on the extraction of the cataract but of these it is to be observed that they contain in general little more than first principles seldom entering into particular detail they have all the merit of first discoveries but those works are so imperfect that they leave wholly to the judgment of the practitioner those minutiae which though they at first sight appear insignificant yet are known to contribute essentially to the expedition and completion of the cure  to supply this defect is the particular intent as has been stated of the present treatise  to absolute novelty in all its parts the author makes no pretension nor indeed in the present advanced state of the sciences does he conceive it to be attainable he rests his work he trusts on the sure basis of utility he is therefore free to confess that perhaps the smaller part of the work is made up of his own ideas in the greater part he has compared his own experience with the principles laid down by those celebrated writers to whom he has alluded  it will depend on the reception of this treatise whether or not he shall lay before the public his ideas on the more complicated diseases of the eye with the modes of cure most warranted by the success of his practice  the author  a treatise etc the definition of a cataract an opaque body placed between the pupil and the vitreous humor intercepting and thereby debilitating or destroying vision forms the disease termed a cataract  the seat of the cataract strictly defined is either in the crystalline humor itself or in its capsule or in the transparent mucous fluid which is between the crystalline lens and its capsule humor morganius in opacities of either of these parts it is called the true cataract and if all these three parts are affected at the same time it is termed the mixed cataract but if the opacity is on the outside of the capsule it is denominated a false cataract to adduce an instance of this last it sometimes occurs that either pus or some other viscid and cloudy matter is found in the anterior chamber the thinner parts of which have been absorbed whilst the thicker remain or that a mucus of a brown color supposed to descend from the pigmentum choroideae is found in the pupil before the capsule which constitutes this description of the disease if after an operation of a cataract the capsule or the tunica hyaloidea or any mucous matter should come behind the pupil opaque this is termed a secondary cataract each of these species of the cataract is subdivided into several others to explain these is not within my present intention my purpose is to confine myself to one of the most common species of the true cataract i mean that disease which consists in an opacity of the crystalline lens only and the operation for its cure is by no means difficult  the diagnosis of the true cataract the indications of this disease may be divided into those which are observed by the patient and those which occur to the practitioner on inspection it is the more necessary to attend to these signs as the amaurosis has in the beginning symptoms not dissimilar to those of a cataract though the distinction manifests itself decisively in the progress of the disease  of the symptoms which occur to the observation of the patient in the case of a cataract are to be remarked first that the vision is gradually debilitated small and remote objects appear in the first instance to be covered with a mist or as it were enveloped in smoke in the progress of the disorder this appearance increases until by degrees it extends itself to the largest and nearest objects from the first affecttion of the organ this symptom is constant and invariable though its progress is accelerated or retarded in different cases in the last stage of its advancement the patient is unable to distinguish any objects and there remains nothing more than a glare of light  secondly the patient in the commencement and progress of the disease can see better by twilight than by daylight the same occurs if the ingress of light be moderated by the intervention of the hand or a screen the reason of this is that as the place is darkened the pupil is enlarged and the result is the same as if the opaque body behind the pupil was in the same degree diminished  thirdly they can see lateral objects much better than those which are diametrically opposite them because the rays of light which enter laterally find the outer part of the crystalline lens less obscured than its center  fourthly some aid is frequently obtained in the commencement of this disease from the use of unequal glasses this may appear until the cause be assigned to contradict some of the preceding remarks it is that objects seen through a unequal glass are represented under a larger angle  fifthly the power of distinguishing light from darkness most generally remains in the last stage of the disease and looking at the sun or a clear fire occasions a bright glare on the eye of the patient  observation of the operator the operator must examine the diseased eye both by daylight and in a darkened room by candlelight and in all directions if only one eye is affected and the operator wishes to observe the motion of the pupil the eye which is not affected must always be kept closely covered as without this precaution the operator may often be greatly mistaken for the pupil of the sound eye being exposed to the light communicates its motion to the pupil of the other and they have commonly one motion which the surgeon will find on close examination of the eye affected    in the middle part of the pupil he will observe an opacity or a cloud which is not natural it sometimes appearing of a white gray yellow green blue or black color but differing from the natural black of the pupil this color in the beginning of the disease is scarcely visible but as the visual faculty diminishes the color becomes more apparent and diffuses itself more and more over the whole pupil forming those little specks or clouds behind the pupil it continues to extend itself in the progress of this disease and the diminution of the sight is always in exact proportion to this extension    if you examine the eye laterally you will observe a black circle around the opacity which in the beginning is large but in the increase of the disorder it appears occasionally larger and smaller in proportion to the dilatation or contraction of the pupil    the iris always preserves its natural color and has at times more and less motion  the operation for the cataract it is very seldom possible to cure the true cataract with medicine only and those few cases where the cataract has been said to be cured without operation by internal and external medicine alone are not sufficiently proved it is matter of great doubt whether the practitioner has not in these cases mistaken an opacity in the transparent cornea or before the pupil for a true cataract in the former cases some relief may possibly be given by medicine internally and externally administered but in a true cataract where the crystalline lens is not only opaque but its whole organization destroyed it is plain that no effectual relief can be obtained but by resorting to an operation  of what the medicines consist which are tried in those cases it is not my purpose to state i confine myself solely to the only efficacious remedy the operation  the operation is practicable in two different methods viz depression and extraction in the first mode of practice the oculist depresses the opaque crystalline lens from its natural situation to the bottom of the eye where being no more behind the pupil it cannot intercept or prevent the rays of light from passing to the retina in the second mode the oculist extracts the opaque crystalline lens by making an incision into the transparent cornea and removing theopaque crystalline lens entirely out of the eye the first operation has been long known and is called depression or couching the second operation is more novel and is called extraction both these modes of operating have their respective preference but it is generally to be observed that the cases where extraction is preferable are much more frequent than those which are to be cured by depression  the season of the year for the performing this operation is not material it is only necessary that the patient be in a moderate degree of warmth and that at all seasons can be effected should any epidemic disorder prevail the time must be considered as unsuited to this as to all other great operations violent heat in summer is at all times fatiguing and under some circumstances dangerous to the patient and should on that account be avoided  the operator may with reason hope for success   when the patient independent of the cataract is in perfect health   when the proximate or occasional cause no longer exists i mean that acrimony arthritic or venereal etc which might have produced the opacity   when the patient after the beginning of the cataract is not affected with frequent headachs and inflammations of the eyes   when the patient can clearly distinguish light from darkness   when the pupil moves free and lively and retains its natural roundness   when the eye has a spacious anterior chamber   when the cataract is at a certain distance behind the pupil and   when the other parts of the eye are perfectly well and free from blemish  but even though there should be a concurrence of all these favorable circumstances yet the operator must be very cautious and indeed can never with propriety insure the success of the operation for even if attended by the most favorable symptoms it may sometimes fail and yet the operator be blameless  preparation of the patient a patient intending to submit to the operation must be prepared and here the golden medium should be observed to which too many operators neglect to attend long experience has proved that excessive or tedious preparation is not only useless to a person who is to undergo the operation for the cataract but it is often injurious  the preparation is special or general special if a patient afflicted with a cataract labors at the same time under other diseases which may have an influence on the operation these diseases must be first removed or the operation will be attended with more hazard such dangerous influence may be caused for example from sordes biliosae plethora congestion from the blood to the head etc etc the general preparation is that which is recommended to every patient afflicted with the cataract and who is in a good state of health  every heat of the body and agitation of the mind is injurious  all strong food and spices etc must for some days preceding the operation be avoided also every thing that causes general heat and obstruction should be disused to clear the primae viae he must take a few days before the operation an opening medicine one great point as well in this as in other operations is to keep the primae viae clear plethora through bleeding and cooling attenuating remedies congestions from the blood to the head must be removed by using lukewarm pediluvia etc etc but this regards the special preparation and every intelligent surgeon must without my advice understand how such complaints are to be removed  in general the preparation must be as short and simple as the constitution of the patient will permit the longer the preparation and the more formality that is used the longer the patient is kept in fear and anxiety this disturbs the secretions and occasions weakness in the nervous system and sharpness in the juices the principal circumstances to be observed in this operation are that the patient is in good spirits free from vexation and anxiety and if possible from any fear of the operation for these reasons i should therefore never defer the time when once fixed avoid letting the patient be acquainted with the hour intended and take him by surprise i have before said that it is impossible to insure success but the operator should always give the greatest hope and take all possible precaution to divert the thoughts from the operation he should conceal every thing that may offend the sound eye of the patient he should avoid a consequential bustle of preparation and be careful not to exhibit his instruments be they ever so magnificent as these always produce apprehension and terror in the patient he should not for the purpose of increasing his own merit make the operation appear more difficult and hazardous than it really is this practice may suit the charlatan but every skilful surgeon must be well convinced it is equally ridiculous and despicable  of the surgeons preparation care and caution are requisite on the part of the surgeon in all operations but he should attend more particularly to this for though it does not affect the life there depends on it one of the most valuable senses the sight  he should at least have every thing in readiness which is necessary for the operation some days before and lest any thing should be wanting at the appointed time it will be proper to examine his apparatus a few hours preceding the operation the delay occasioned by waiting for any thing at that time is awkward and disagreeable both to the surgeon and patient and may perhaps be injurious  the main point is that the surgeon should know well how to place himself that nothing may embarrass him and that he may be free from all involuntary motion he should likewise be careful to keep all the actions of his patient in his power  you cannot sufficiently admonish the patient to refrain from every sudden motion of the head and eyes which always impedes and frequently defeats the whole of the operation therefore this operation is seldom practicable on children with success because this advice is useless  most surgeons to fix the head of the patient press it against the breast of an assistant but it is obvious that the least motion even the assistant drawing breath occasions a corresponding motion of the head of the patient it is impossible that a man should be as immovable as a machine that the operator may have the head of the patient fast and wholly in his power i propose therefore a chair which i have for many years found to be useful see tab i fig   it is a strongmade chair to which is fastened a back a which on each side by means of a screw b moves backwards and forwards in the top d which can by c if necessary be turned back is a little concave cloth cushion for the greater security of the head and to prevent slipping as i always perform the operation standing the chair is made convenient for my size and to make the patient a proper height i have different pieces of wood tab ii fig   e e to put under the cushion each of these pieces of wood has two pegs f f which fit in the holes of the seat the cushion tab ii fig   h is made in a wooden frame to which is fixed tab ii fig   two pieces of iron i i which go through the holes f f in the chair and fasten at the back in the hind part of the chair with an iron peg tab i fig   g g there is nothing to be observed more than two bars fig   h h to support the top i is a stand to prevent its falling received into the notches k which enable the operator by their different distances to incline the moveable top as much backwards as he thinks suited to the most favorable position of the head during the operation  let the patient be seated a few days before the operation upon this chair and bring the seat to the proper height that the head may exactly rest within the concave cushion that on the day of the operation he may not have any secondary things to claim his attention  in the like manner have ready all the instruments and bandages the bandage which i use for this operation is tab ii fig   a double piece of linen a a about three fingers broad and proportioned in its length to the circumference of the head at each end of this bandage are to be fixed two strings b b to tie it upon the forehead to this piece are sewed two pieces of double dark colored silk or linen c c about six fingers square so that the piece which covers the diseased eye should be a little under the other piece that no light may possibly reach the eye on which the operation has been performed these two pieces must not reach below the nose this bandage two thin pledgets for using after the operation some lint to cover the sound eye during the operation a thin silk handkerchief to tie up the sound eye and a linen one to dry the tears are all that is necessary on this occasion  some inconveniences result during this operation from the necessity of keeping up the upper eyelid with the finger alone as it easily slips clown and the tears which flow incessantly make it so slippery that it is impossible to retain it with the finger without either drying it continually or making a dangerous pressure upon the eye  much advantage must arise therefore from keeping up the eyelid without causing any irritation or pressure on the eye and to obtain this end i use the elevator vide tab iii fig   which is of silver wire about two lines thick it has on the upper part by a a ring by which the assistant keeps it from b to b it should be well nealed that by this means becoming softer it may be more easily adapted to the form of the orbit of the upper eyelid and fit well without pinching  the knife which i use for this operation tab iii fig   is the same as that improved by the celebrated professor richter in gottingen and which i have found certainly to be the best for this operation i shall therefore in the description use this great oculists own words  the knife which i use is different from every other knife intended for the same purpose simple as it may appear there are still a great many things to be remarked concerning it it may perhaps be supposed that more depends on the hand that guides the knife than on the knife itself and there is some truth in this but we shall soon be convinced that the ease and nicety with which the operation is executed depends very much indeed on the structure and make of the knife and who would not rather use a convenient knife than such a one as is managged with difficulty and inconvenience one of the great requisites in this operation is not to allow the aqueous humor to flow out until the incision be ended therefore the blade of the knife must be constructed in such a manner that it gradually increases in breadth from the point to the heel in order both to enlarge the wound as it passes along and also to fill up the incision as it is made and thus prevent the discharge of the aqueous humor both mr berangers knife and mine are of this shape and all others not so constructed are worth nothing the whole depends upon this that the knife with which we are to cut the cornea should at its broadest part be fully as broad as half the diameter of the cornea the cornea is in general about six lines in diameter the knife therefore must be three lines in breadth and at least ten lines distant from the point taking it for granted however that no more than the under half of the cornea is intended to be cut through in using a knife such as i have described we shall find that as soon as it has traversed the anterior chamber and that that part of its blade which is three lines in breadth enters the eye then the inferior portion of the cornea will be divided it is unnecessary to draw the instrument back the whole is done with one cut and the aqueous humor does not flow out before that is finished in the case of a prominent eye this knife of professor richter is very useful but i think not in those where the eye lies deep there will certainly be danger in the latter instance that this projecting point may lacerate some part of the internal angle of the eye and thereby produce a sudden motion of that organ so as to disturb the whole operation therefore have some broader knives in readiness of which the blade should increase in breadth so rapidly that the broadest part of it be only seven or eight lines from the point   the blade of my knife is about an inch and an half in length it is unequal on both sides whilst the knife traverses the anterior chamber of the eye the convexity of its side presses the iris back and keeps it from falling under the edge a unequal blade also is easier pushed through the cornea than a flat one and it does not rub so much on the iris  the point of the knife must be sharp on both edges for the least the breadth of one line in order that it may enter quickly and easily  particular care ought to be taken that the point of the knife is well conditioned i have seen it happen that the point of the knife has bent on the cornea i saw in the year      from the famous oculist the brother p  ii  r a worse accident viz the point of the knife was too rigid and in the coming out at the internal angle of the cornea the point broke off more than one line they would not wait till i could send for a magnet but opened the wound in the cornea larger and through an inapt manner the lens with capsule and a part of the vitreous humor suddenly came out the broken piece of the knife fell into the posterior chamber a violent inflammation and a purulent eye was the consequence the other eye on which the operation has been performed with the best success was in consequence of the accident to the last affected with the same inflammation and the poor woman after having suffered much was entirely blind with both eyes if such a knife be not very sharp it does not enter and upon the surgeon making use of more force it suddenly pierces the cornea and lacerates the iris the great error consists in making the point too thin and too flexible in a word too much like the point of a lancet a knife whose point is so constructed subjects the operator almost to a certainty of lacerating the iris it is true that with a little dexterity especially if the point be very sharp the knife may be made to enter the anterior chamber of the eye with apparent ease but as soon as it comes in contact with the opposite and internal surface of the cornea owing to the density of that membrane and the obliquity of its direction the thin flexible point is reflected posteriorly and unavoidably lacerates the iris before it can be pushed through the other side particular direction ought therefore to be given to the instrumentmaker to have the point made pretty strong and firm although not rigid nor inelastic  the back of the knife must be made quite blunt as we push the knife forward its back ought to be turned a little toward the iris this would be impossible were it sharp from the risk we should run of wounding that part it is evident that a knife with a sharp back such as poyets etc must cut the cornea both upwards and downwards which is quite contrary to the intention of the surgeon who only wishes to cut the inferior half of that membrane for which reason the knife ought to cut only downwards  the back of the knife must not therefore be sharp nor must it be too thick the thinner the better for when it is thick it dilates the upper angle of the wound too much and causes a small opening at the top through which the aqueous humor may flow out the back of my knife is thin and therefore has not that inconvenience i must here take notice that the person who sharpens the instrument very often through inattention sharpens it on the back especially near the point this neglect if not discovered may be attended with bad consequence for my part before i make use of a new sharpened knife i always pass the back of it over a fine stone  the back of the knife must be perfectly straight not bent nor curved a knife perfectly straight on the back which is made to enter the anterior chamber of the eye at the external point of the transverse diameter of the cornea will easily follow that direction and come out exactly at the opposite point but on the contrary if a knife be made use of with the back curved or bent it must happen that the point although entered exactly opposite the center of the cornea will come out much lower at the opposite side and indeed always the lower the more bent it is it is true this fault may be corrected by elevating the point of the knife in the chamber of the aqueous humor as soon as it approaches the inside of the eye and then pushing it through the cornea but that is a particular maneuver that requires much attention and renders the operation at least more difficult for the fewer steps there are in any operation the easier will that operation be  so far professor richter  tab iii fig   is a straight knife the blade about an inch and an half long and two lines in breadth on the point is a little button  tab iii fig   is the needle for opening the capsule  tab iii fig   is a hook which i use for extracting the obscured capsule etc  tab iii fig   is the parma spear corrected by casaamata to make an unsteady eye firm this spear is two inches in length with a handle as long again the needle is bent like an s a half line behind the sharp point is a large blunt button to prevent the point going too deep in the cornea  tab iii fig   is a little broad hook for keeping down the under eyelid while using the spear fig   by a it is hooked in the under eyelid and by b a little weight or a key is suspended  it is a frequent complaint of the surgeons in this operation that the knife for cutting the cornea is never sufficiently sharp this complaint is often very just therefore it would be better if the surgeon were to endeavor himself to sharpen his instruments than that he should be obliged to rely on the word of the instrumentmaker sometimes this complaint is unjust as bluntness will often seem to exist but is in reality produced by resistance from the hardness and thickness of the cornea and as often from the fearful and unsteady hand of the operator  all the instruments that are necessary for this operation must as i have before said be ready at least a day before the operation and the chair brought to such a height that the patients head may rest exactly within the concave cushion the elevator tab iii fig   properly bent and every thing in due readiness  from the room in which the operation is to be performed all false light must be excluded and for that purpose every window except the one which gives the best light for the operation must be effectually closed not only a double but a too strong light is dangerous therefore at the same time be careful to regulate the unclosed window in such a manner that at any moment during the operation you may have as much more or less light as may be necessary for your purpose  the patients bed must be adjacent or if possible in the same room in which the operation is performed every motion after the operation is not only troublesome but dangerous to the patient the sleeping room must be made dark and carefully preserved from any possible entrance of strong light  let the patient be released from all superfluous clothing and let him be in a nightgown or greatcoat that he may not be after the operation long occupied or in useless motion by undressing  if the patient is remarkably timid it may be as well that he should not know when you propose to perform the operation for which purpose you may therefore give him frequent visits at unappointed times if he should absolutely desire to be acquainted with the fixed hour for the operation rather tell him a day later than that actually fixed for the purpose that if any unforeseen impediment should make it necessary to postpone the operation the surgeon may still keep his word with the patient  one cannot too scrupulously adhere to a promise made to those who count with passionate expectation each minute looking forward to that happy one when they hope to receive their sight every disappointment should likewise be avoided on another account as it tends to disturb the serenity of the patient and by ruffling his spirits to render him less fit to undergo so important an operation  the surgeon to return to necessary minutiae should take every care to have a strong chair for himself in case he should sit during the operation he should likewise choose as clear a day and sky as possible the light of the sun is injurious and a sky which is one moment bright and the next clouded is apt to derange the operator  if the patient has not had an evacuation on the day of the operation let him have an emollient opening clyster a few hours before and if he should be very fearful of the operation give him an hour preceding one grain of opium with some wine which will be found of service  when every thing is thus prepared i now come to the operation itself but here let me remark that in my judgment it should be performed on one eye only at a time in case the patient should be blind of both the contrary practice can only have originated in the precipitance of some itinerant oculist who not having patience to wait for the recovery of the first eye undertake the double operation for the sake of the double fee he then departs and frequently leaves the patient in a state of incurable blindness to show the hazard and to demonstrate the inhumanity of this practice it is only necessary to observe that the operation for a cataract may be performed on one eye with the best success yet through some unexpected circumstance fail with respect to the other the immediate communication between the eyes is well understood the strong inflammation of the eye on which the operation has miscarried affects the other in its weakened state and by this means both are frequently lost a variety of such cases have come within my knowledge in the course of my practice and all arising from that indecent precipitation which i have stated if the patient can see after the operation of one eye then he does not require to undergo a second on the other but on the contrary if it should so happen that the first miscarries there is a remaining hope of success from the second this hope as i have observed is totally extinguished by a double operation  here a question occurs which i think this the proper place to discuss namely whether the assistant should be a surgeon or a man acquainted with this operation or not my opinion is he should not it is supposed that an informed man can assist the operator but he wants no other aid than the simple act of keeping up the eyelid the assistant need not therefore be acquainted with the operation on the contrary i maintain that an assistant who thinks himself possessed of knowledge is of much more injury than use his curiosity and earnestness to see the operation as he stands behind the patient causes him to bow his head over and to forget to take care of the eyelid or he makes a dangerous pressure on the eye his confidence may even go far enough if he keep up the eyelid with the finger to think that he may aid the operator by a push or a pressure in the operation which is enough to defeat the whole i have seen many instances of this it is therefore clear that an assistant having any knowledge of the business instead of advantage occasions inconvenience and danger i therefore should recommend for an assistant an intelligent man who is unacquainted with the operation and attentive only to the instructions of the operator  the assistant should have been previously instructed to watch the eyes of the surgeon who must let him know by their means to lift the eyelid or the contrary it is proper to accustom every assistant to understand by signs from the operator what he has occasion for as a blind person is ever attentive to hear what passes and the calling for instruments knives scissors etc make fearful impressions on the patient the surgeon should rather during the operation converse with him on indifferent subjects and endeavor to turn his thoughts from what is doing  the operation first take from the patient his neckcloth unbutton his shirt collar and release him from every thing which may hinder the free circulation then seat him in the chair that is already adapted to the height required let him put his hands across his back or secure them in such a manner by a strong inflexible cane placed between his arms and back as to be certain that during the operation he cannot direct them to his eyes or the instruments of the operator if this situation should incommode a lusty person you must direct the assistants to give strict attention to his hands the operator must either stand or sit on a strong chair but in such a position that his mouth may be exactly on a level with the eyes of the patient the feet of the latter must be stretched out betwixt those of the operator the surgeon must in this situation be near to a window that he may have a clear light the patient must sit so that the light may fall sideways over the nose to the affected eye for if the patient sits opposite the light the surgeon himself being in the shadow this interposition hinders him observing if the pupil be clear on the contrary if the light comes from the side of that eye on which the operation is to be performed the shadow of the hand or the knife is always an obstruction some pretend that the eye always turns toward the light this is not quite certain in the case of a patient afflicted with the cataract it is more clear that the blade of the knife or the hand always make a shadow and that the eye is otherwise too much exposed to the light but in this particular every surgeon may do as he thinks best  let the assistant be now placed behind the patients chair the latter being seated as before directed in such a manner that the light falls sideways over the nose upon the eye affected take then some doubled lint and put it on the eye which is not to be operated and tie it fast with a thin silk handkerchief which is preferable because it takes but little room lest the sound eye should come into motion and by its communicating with the other render the operation more difficult it is necessary to have some wine ready to refresh the patient during the operation and some cold and warm water the surgeon should select all the necessary instruments and place them on a napkin in a dish in the probable order he may want them and let an assistant hold this near to him that he may readily take those for which he has occasion  during the time that the cornea is divided much light must fall on the eye for through that the pupil contracts itself and the iris will not so easily press under the edge of the knife and at the same time you have less to fear from the sudden protrusion of the crystalline lens after the incision is finished  with the elevator tab iii fig   the upper eyelid must be kept up give this into the hand of the assistant who is behind the patients chair but never let the assistant put it on if it is the left eye which i now propose for the operation the assistant must keep his right hand under the chin of the patient and support it in such a manner that his face may be a little turned upwards and at the same time let the head be gently pressed against the back of the chair the assistant keeps the elevator with the left hand by a pressing it gently upwards against the edge of the orbit  many oculists during the operation keep the hand with which they make the incision in the cornea firm on the cheek of the patient some put their elbow on their knee and rest their foot on a stool others lay their elbow on a table etc etc to make their hand more firm but all these positions seem to me to be too confined and to hinder that freedom of motion which is necessary to an operator my method is to press the upper part of the arm and elbow of that hand with which i perform the operation strongly against my own breast and ribs and lean my little finger about an inch from the outside of the eye on the cheekbone of the patient and as soon as i see the eye in a good position i at once hold my breath and remain in that situation while i make the incision in the cornea which assists greatly the firmness of the hand though this may appear trifling it will be found of great utility  to command the patient in harsh words to keep his eye steady is absurd it only tends to excite apprehension as the motion of the eye is not in his power any harshness can only add to his fear and thereby render the eye more unsteady therefore leave him to himself give him a small quantity of wine and you will find that the patient will be quiet and in a few minutes the eye quite steady  the surgeon in this operation on the left eye must press with the first and middle finger of his left hand the under eyelid down and if the eye is a little unsteady he must make the pressure rather stronger with the middle finger which hinders it retreating into the inner corner  the knife he must take in his fingers like a pen and lean the little finger of his right hand on the cheekbone of the patient and he should give great attention to the motion when the eye is directly straight forward but looking a little up and outward as soon as the eye is in that direction introduce the knife a little over the horizontal diameter and a half line from the albuginea in the cornea but do not insert the knife in the cornea if the eye be not in the position just now stated the impatience of the surgeon sometimes so far misleads him that although the eye is not in the right direction by introducing his knife into it he hopes to bring it right but in this case he is greatly mistaken it will be found infinitely better to wait the favorable moment the coolest patience is necessary as well as the strongest presence of mind in an operation on which depends the greatest happiness of life  the sight  the incision in the cornea must be shaped like an half circle and must begin in the outer corner of the eye a little over the horizontal diameter as i have stated in the transparent cornea and come out in the same direction in the inner corner of the eye that the under half of the cornea may be cut and this incision must be the distance of half a line from the albuginea  in this part of the operation much depends on the incision being sufficiently large and it is always better that it should be a little too large than too small the only way of making the incision sufficiently large is by keeping the knife in passing through the oblique diameter as near as possible to the outer edge of the cornea the farther the entering of the knife is from the outer edge of the cornea the less will be the incision the larger the incision is the more easily and gently the crystalline lens is extracted through the pupil it is not my intention to advise the incision to be twothirds of the circle of the cornea there may be an apprehension in this case of a sudden protrusion of the crystalline lens and also of the vitreous humor and iris  particular care should be taken by the operator that he performs this incision well that the aqueous humor does not run out before the whole incision be finished if the aqueous humor flows out sooner the anterior chamber collapses while the knife is still in it the iris becomes then close to the cornea and comes before the point and under the edge of the knife in this case it is impossible to bring the knife through the anterior chamber to the inner corner of the eye without hurting or wounding the iris and to continue the incision in the collapsed cornea with the same knife would make the wound too high and uneven and by this means the whole operation often miscarries of this i shall speak hereafter but take all possible precautions to finish the operation with proper quickness by making the whole incision with an even movement in the cornea at once before the aqueous humor escapes  as soon as the eye is in the direction that is desired you must make with that finger with which you keep down the under eyelid a soft easy pressure on the eye as i have before said put in the point of the knife a little right angular then if you put it a little awry you will soon come betwixt the lamellae of the cornea and push through the cornea  now the knife is through the cornea in the anterior chamber change the direction so that the point be directed to the spot at the inner corner where it must come out keep the knife quite parallel with the iris but with the edge a little outward from it and push it with an even movement to the inner corner and finish the incision as i directed before  if the eye is prominent the anterior chamber large the patient not very timid the eye quiet and the operator has firmness enough in his hand sufficient presence of mind and be not precipitate this part of the operation may always be performed with a sufficient share of certainty  but in spite of every previous rule and every possible precaution it will sometimes happen through unforeseen circumstances or mistake of the operator that the incision is not properly finished this is occasioned either by the motion of the eye on the internal angle or the aqueous humor escaping too soon or the iris falling before the point or under the edge of the knife etc  if the surgeon as soon as he observes that the eye begins to turn to the inner canthus cannot prevent it by a soft pressure with the finger on the under and inner side he will do best to press the knife directly downwards and divide through as much of the cornea as possible and if it should be only a half of the incision he intended he can afterward finish it with a pair of scissors to draw the eye forward in this case with the knife that is in it and to finish the incision requires all the dexterity of an experienced and cool hand and even then seldom succeeds it is said only through prejudice that the opening by a pair of scissors makes a wound which is apt to suppurate and frequently leaves behind an opaque cicatrix repeated experience proves that an opening in the cornea with a good sharp pair of scissors will heal as even and as well as if done with a knife those which are used for this purpose are different i make use of a pair like those of daviel with blunted points the method of using these scissors is quite simple i lay in an operation of the left eye my fore finger of my left hand fast on the cheek of the patient to keep down the eyelid i then place my scissors on the back of the finger as a firm point and make the incision in the cornea sufficiently large  the cases in which the iris generally falls before the point and under the edge of the knife are when it is inserted too near the outer edge of the cornea too near the albuginea when the aqueous humor flows out too soon when the assistant makes a pressure upon the eye or through any other cause occasions a spasm from irritation on the muscles of the eye by which the iris is pressed forwards if with every precaution observed the iris should fall before the point of the knife you must try by a soft pressure and rubbing upon the cornea to make the iris retreat and move the point of the knife a little to the cornea and over the iris if the iris falls forward and the knife is in the inner canthus and through the cornea try likewise through a soft rubbing upon the cornea and by keeping your knife still to make the iris recede and to finish the incision  if notwithstanding all these endeavors the iris will not recede be not precipitate turn not the edge of the knife more toward the cornea to finish the incision it never can in this manner be made as it should be and you endanger the patient for the cicatrix will after the operation appear too high and on its size and situation depends the sight the best mode under these circumstances is to withdraw the knife and to finish the opening with a pair of scissors or with a knife with a blunted point as will be mentioned in the sequel  sometimes before the operation the eye is in such an unquiet and convulsive state that all the repose and intervals that are given cannot make it quiet if the surgeon retaining his presence of mind has lost all hopes of fixing the eye and is convinced that there remains nothing else but to secure it with an instrument i believe that out of all the number of instruments recommended for this purpose the spear of parma corrected by casaamata tab iii fig   is one of the best the inconvenience of this instrument is that it requires the whole hand of the surgeon and will not admit a finger to be left for keeping down the under eyelid but this fault is to be remedied by affixing the little hook tab iii fig   to the under eyelid by a and by b hang a small key heavy enough to keep it down by this is spared a hand extraordinary but be sure to avoid as much as possible all superfluous instruments  in the operation of the left eye you take the spear tab iii fig   by a in the left hand put up by b the fore finger and watch when the eye is in the direction before mentioned and push at once the point of the spear horizontally about a half line over the oblique diameter of the cornea and half a line from the albuginea in the inner part of the cornea in this manner you can by a soft pressure with the spear keep the eye without harm immoveably fixed when you find that this is effected push the knife at the same moment into the opposite side tab iv fig   as i before intimated and complete the incision but if you make use of the elevator tab iii fig   to sustain the upper eyelid then make a soft pressure with the finger with which you keep down the under eyelid and take care that the point of the knife be well sharpened and choose one which has not too thick a blade you will be very seldom incommoded through the strong motion of the eye and it is not often that the use of the spear will be necessary  the method thus described of cutting the cornea at once and with one knife can always be used when the eye is quiet but every experienced oculist knows that though before the operation the patient and the eye are quiet he cannot rely on the same degree of quiet during the operation  the slight irritation which arises from keeping up the upper eyelid and the beginning of the operation in piercing the cornea though void of feeling particularly with sensitive and irritable patients often occasion a sudden spasm in the muscles of the eye though the cornea be cut at once and in the best manner yet if the eye be prominent with a large moveable pupil the crystalline lens with or without its capsule may suddenly gush out and frequently with it a part of the vitreous humor this case often happens and sometimes without detriment to the patient but there too frequently arises from this an irregularity a prolapsus and paralysis of the iris and concretion of the pupil synizesis by which the whole operation is frustrated  this is sufficiently proved by a great variety of cases where the best skill of the most experienced oculist was of no avail  in such a delicate operation as that which has for its object to restore the sight nothing dare ultimately be hazarded it remains therefore only to state the safest and most efficacious mode of proceeding in case of the accident happening which i have just stated  i am not for my own part of the number of oculists who pride themselves on the mechanical adroitness of performing this operation the credit of quickness must not be attained by the operator at the price of the patients safety  some oculists advise in the case of a spasm when the knife is in the eye or the point through the anterior chamber and such convulsion should occur to keep the knife for a moment steady and to finish the incision slowly i have tried at different times this manner but always found that the crystalline lens sprung forwards suddenly and frustrated every precaution  experience proves the success of the operation to be the better the more slowly the crystalline lens comes forwards because the pupil is the more gradually dilated but on the contrary the quick coming forward of the crystalline lens by its distending too suddenly tends to lacerate and to destroy the figure of the pupil afterward in the latter case the pupil loses its motion and changes its figure and the consequence is a proportional diminution of the sight vide tab iv fig   when i observe therefore in this operation such an irritation and convulsive contraction of the muscles of the eye which chiefly manifests itself from the suddenly starting and pressing forward of the eye an immediate bloodshot appearance in the vessels the conjunctiva an advance of the crystalline lens and iris toward the cornea etc an experienced hand will aslo in a moment perceive a stronger and closer pressure against the knife and combining all these circumstances the operator is clear of a spasm coming on violently in this case when i have my knife in the eye i push it into the inner corner through the cornea at least more than a line outward vide tab iv fig   and draw it in the same direction backward out of the eye with the certainty of not wounding the iris however being so far advanced it would be easy for me to complete the incision at once but by drawing back the knife the aqueous humor flows out the eye from that circumstance becomes collapsed the muscles not moving with such strength it begins to be quieter and comes into that state which is desired the pupil is now more dilated and the crystalline lens more forward but by a gentle rubbing on the closed eye and applying a handkerchief with cold or a little warm water as the circumstance requires the crystalline lens will soon recede and set the iris free this moment must be waited for with patience when the patient and his eye are at length quiet i order the upper eyelid to be again kept up and take that knife at the point of which is a little round blunted button vide tab iii fig   with this knife i reenter the opening vide tab iv fig   a and come out through the anterior chamber by b in the inner corner without the least injury to the iris and then can as shows the white points by c finish the incision as large as i desire  my reasons for using two knives when i could finish the incision with one are that in the first place i wish the eye to be perfectly quiet the spasm mitigated and to prevent the dangerous sudden starting out of the crystalline lens etc etc and secondly i cannot see of what dedetriment this second knife can be as having at the point a little round button by which it cannot wound or irritate as it acts only on the insensible cornea i never knew any great inflammation follow in consequence of this treatment  let us now suppose the cornea cut as it should be and large enough for the passage of the crystalline lens be not precipitate in drawing out the crystalline lens but let the eye become again quiet  the room must soon after the opening of the cornea be more darkened to promote the dilatation of the pupil and then try if the crystalline lens with its capsule will come out by a soft pressure in this instance the operator himself must keep the upper eyelid up with his finger this soft pressure is made by the two underlaid fingers alternately which occasions the crystalline lens to revolve on its axis and at length come out of the eye  but if the operator should perceive that the crystalline lens with its capsule will not come near to the pupil and that the latter is not much enlarged let him desist in a moment from the attempt and bring the eye again into a state of rest for if he should venture to press more strongly the vitreous humor would protrude first leaving the cataract with its capsule behind this is the worst event which can attend the operation it sometimes happens also that by too violent a pressure the capsule is forcibly rent at the moment the cataract comes forward  eminent oculists have observed and my own experience has confirmed it that if the capsule be forcibly rent in the operation the greater part of it becomes thereby afterward opaque and there remains either a weak sight or very often a second blindness caracta secundaria but on the contrary if the capsule be well opened and cut with a sharp instrument if a strong inflammation should not occur the capsule commonly remains clear and transparent  but to return to the operation if the eye is again quiet then let the upper eyelid be kept up by the assistant with the elevator and let the operator proceed to open the capsule  the opening in the capsule must be made as large as possible it sometimes happens that the crystalline lens while it comes through the capsule leaves behind an opaque slime or a broken piece which must be carefully extracted this sometimes is not done without much difficulty but it seldom happens if the capsule is sufficiently opened but if the incision in the capsule is not large enough it is in vain to attempt the taking out of the opaque part remaining  a second reason for largely opening the capsule is that if for any particular reason the opaque remainder cannot be extracted you have the hope founded upon repeated experience that the aqueous humor whilst it flows in the capsule will dissolve the opaque body this will be more certain in proportion to the size of the opening some oculists open the cornea and the capsule at the same time but in this mode the opening in the latter never can be large enough some open it with the cystotom of lafaye etc etc but i make use of a doubleedged needle tab iii fig   of a lancet form in the following manner by the operation of the left eye make the flap d of the chair fall over behind and let the head of the patient lean a little back if the operator has before been seated he must now stand to have free motion in finishing the other part of the operation with my right hand i take the spoon of daviel and with it keep up the wound in the cornea i take in the left hand this needle and keep the under eyelid down with the little finger of the same hand i then pass this needle through the wound in the cornea into the pupil and open the capsule as much as possible and try to cut it in two half circles that a whole piece may be taken out from the center to cut a large piece out of the capsule a great degree of dexterity is necessary to the dilatation of the pupil namely to press with the underlaid little finger softly the globe of the eye whereby the crystalline lens with its capsule comes nearer to the pupil which dilates but this as i have said requires great caution as the capsule is easily torn by this pressure and by the touch of the needle the cataract will be found suddenly to come out which must be avoided if the capsule be cut as well as it is required the cataract now by the soft pressure of the underlaid fingers turns about its axis and falls out of the wound in the cornea it is to be observed that the lower edge of the crystalline lens turns forward and upward and comes into the pupil before it presses or distends the lower part of the iris outward in any considerable degree then presses it so forward and downward that it may be out at the wound in the cornea till at last the lower edge and the posterior part of the crystalline lens slips down over the lower edge of the pupil and out at the wound of the cornea if the operator takes care after this extraction to keep the eye in a horizontal situation this slow dilatation of the pupil is of no detriment the pupil will be perfectly round and come into its former place  in case the cataract is wholly come out of the eye more light should be admitted into the room to observe if the pupil be quite clear  the operator must be very cautious and keep his hand over the operated eye and let just as much light fall on it as he finds by his examination to be necessary he should observe most accurately if any part of the cataract or of the humor morgagnii or of the capsule remains behind opaque if any should be found he must endeavor to bring the first out with the spoon of daviel and the latter with a pair of small nippers or the hook tab iii fig   those opaque particles often remain in the eye undiscovered by the strictest examination and make their appearance after the wound in the cornea is closed they are concealed during the operation in the upper part of the capsule because the pupil is frequently drawn down after the operation it is therefore the more necessary to examine the pupil by different degrees of light that if any thing opaque remains behind it may be discovered  in this examination the greatest caution is requisite on account of the irritation occasioned by the entrance of the light into the tender eye if the pupil be quite clear and black and no portion of the iris fallen within the wound of the cornea instantly close the eye and by no means try to make any experiment whether the patient can or cannot see he can seldom see distinctly on account of the extracted crystalline lens the flowing out of the aqueous humor which renders the cornea wrinkled and flabby but at all events it is a vain glorious essay which is dangerous for the patients tender eye which being accustomed to darkness is irritated by the light this curiosity seldom goes unpunished  accidents by this operation in this operation accidents may occur the principal of these are an escape of the vitreous humor or sometimes a protrusion of the iris or both may happen on these i shall say a few words  if this humor comes forward before the cataract it is for the most part assignable to some fault of the operator as soon as the vitreous humor appears either with or after the coming out of the cataract the head of the patient should instantly be placed in a horizontal position and the eye immediately closed i know that the vitreous humor is propelled not only by its specific gravity but is pressed out by a spasm in the muscles of the eye but in either case i believe this horizontal situation to be the best that can be adopted when the eye is closed the rest should be left entirely to nature every effort to cut away with scissors or to return the part of the vitreous humor that hangs out of the cornea is not only unnecessary but certainly injurious as in all these practices light is required which occasions an irritation of the tender eye and increases the contraction of the muscles which press on the globe of the eye and of course tends to promote the flowing out of the vitreous humor  i have often had occasion to observe that if a part of the vitreous humor comes out of the wound it is not always injurious in the event on the contrary some patients have again received their sight in a greater degree it is supposed in such cases that the vitreous humor fills up the vacancy where the crystalline had before been placed and this with more advantage to the sight than the thin aqueous humor which would be otherwise in that place but notwithstanding this apparent advantage i always endeavor as much as i can to prevent the flowing out of the vitreous humor it has been observed that the inflammation is always much greater with those patients who have lost a part of this humor than commonly happens to those who have suffered no such accident and it likewise mostly leaves behind a deformed and an imperfect pupil too near to the cicatrix this does not always impair the sight but depends on the greater or less thickness of the cicatrix vide tab iv fig   it often happens by the flowing out of this humor that a secondary cataract arises however completely the whole crystalline lens with its capsule are come out of the eye the cause of this secondary cataract is the torn and after obscured tunica hyaloidea which i have observed in several places  if the cataract is suddenly or heedlessly pressed put of the eye it seldom occurs at the same time but in general soon after the operation that the iris falls into the wound of the cornea this appears also after the operation if the patient presses himself on the eye as well as if the operation was inaccurately performed  this protrusion of the iris occasions pain for ever which is sometimes vehement and principally increases with the motions of the eye the fallen part of the iris rubbing continually on the eyelid the operator should therefore endeavor with all possible care to detect this prolapsus of the iris soon after the operation much depends on this circumstance that the iris be put back immediately before it is inflamed and swollen and before it adheres to the cornea or becomes obdurate  if the eye after it is covered should prove very unquiet and the patient feel a pricking pain on the least motion of the organ if the eye which has not shed many tears after the operation at once begins to run much then you have reason to suppose such protrusion of the iris especially if something has happened in the operation to give occasion to this accident the operator has then just grounds with sufficient precaution to open that eye if his fear should be confirmed his first effort should be to bring back again that protruded part of the iris this can be done without difficulty if it is recent and the wound in the cornea large and open with the spoon of daviel and by soft pressure and rubbing the iris will be restored to its situation again in this case let the patient lie a few days in bed with his head in an horizontal position and do not make the least pressure upon the eye now and then let a strong light fall through the eyelid on the eye because by this means the eye is irritated and the pupil contracted  it is not my aim to speak at present on more complicated cases on a future occasion i shall probably enter on those parts of the subject not comprised in the present treatise  the treatment of the patient after the operation when the operation is finished make the room almost quite dark untie the handkerchief from the sound eye and take two pledgets about three inches long and two broad of long linen with the threads one way pulled out wetted with cold water and lay them cold and wetted on both eyes then fasten the bandage tab ii fig   with the strings on the forehead now bring the patient with slow steps supported by the assistants and with his head in a horizontal position to his bed which in cold or damp weather must be first warmed with a patient who is plethoric and has a short neck you should observe not to suffer him to be with his head too low because you would drive more blood to his head which is hurtful therefore let him rather sit in an inclined posture with his head lying rather horizontally  when he is in bed let him be released from all unnecessary clothing and give him a cup of warm tea to restore the perspiration which was suppressed through fear but let it be given him with a spout or a teapot without raising or moving the head  i know that some surgeons reject all bandages after the operation and they are in the right if the meaning of such bandages is to bind or tie up the eye with a compress from twelve to twentyfour hours or for some days every practitioner has his own particularities not founded on caprice but which his own experience has proved to him to be the best  the principal reason why i mostly use the cold and wetted pledgets from twentyfour to fortyeight hours is that the coldness contracts the vessels and diminishes the impetus of the blood the ungovernable motion of the eye with the eyelids after the operation is also diminished by laying any thing on the eyelids without making a strong pressure for this purpose i find the pledgets to be the best they should be made of linen the threads being one way pulled out and not scraped lint the former not being so raw and ragged of course clings less to the eyelashes it also lies better and more even than such a compress of lint the pledget should not be too small because it will cover better and can be easier taken hold of in applying and taking it away it should be taken away and applied from the outside to the inside because it may otherwise injure the eyelashes if they stick together and if you would take it from below upward it is liable to be pulled asunder the eyes being so nearly connected it is my practice to cover both after one or two hours i take off the pledget which serves the purpose of a thermometer to discover from its dryness or moisture the state of the operated eye by comparing it with that of the sound one  on account of the heat arising from the incipient inflammation the pledgets should never be quite dry as it occasions pain therefore without taking it off it must be often wetted with a sponge dipped in cold water from which the patient will find much mitigation of his suffering i never remember to have had an oedematous swelling of the eyelids of which those who make use of dry bandages complain i will by no means say that in all cases the cold wet bandages is to be advised on the contrary the former is to be preferred with irritable and susceptible patients and such as are inclined to take cold or subject to catarrhs to mitigate the disagreeable situation of the patient lying on his back he should also have every additional aid from pillows and changing cushions etc this restraint is in my opinion indispensably necessary for the first twelve or twentyfour hours as the extraction of the cataract and the flowing out of the aqueous humor for a short time occasions a vacuum if therefore the patient was to have his head upright the vitreous humor would press with the iris toward the wound in the cornea the pupil would sink downwards the aqueous humor would flow out and hinder the healing of the wound in the cornea but by this horizontal situation the vitreous humor has not an external cause to change its place the iris can move freely without falling into the wound of the cornea the pupil comes in the middle where it has before been and the operator obtains his purpose completely  amongst the necessary precautions one is that you be secure of the patients hands if you are convinced that when awake and governable he will not touch his eyes yet the least irritation occasions him if asleep to rub or press the eye and through it frustrate the whole operation you cannot trust to the attendants of the patient as they often are unable to prevent the quick movement of the hands therefore i take a ribbon one yard long and fasten it at each end to the wrists of the patient to the middle of this ribbon i knot another which i fasten to the foot of the bed in such a manner that the patient can only reach his mouth with the points of his fingers  let the lower part of his body be kept sufficiently warm as well as his feet and the head cool but not so bare as to expose him to taking cold  after the operation there is nothing more to be feared than the inflammation and its consequence it will be less if the patient is well prepared more if this is at all neglected it however sometimes appears sooner sometimes later when the first fever which commonly comes in the first night if the eye has suffered much by the operation is high it is always expected to be violent be not careless with a patient who should be some days without pain inflammation or fever as sometimes he is without either until the sixth or eighth day when the inflammation comes on suddenly and vehemently i have seldom had occasion to complain of any high inflammation after this operation and the few cases which i have experienced the first period has always passed and on the sixth or eighth day the inflammation has begun at once with much vehemence and always through some fault of the patient  it is impossible to advise specific rules for these cases the constitution of the patient and the degree of injury the eye has suffered during the operation must indicate to the surgeon what remedies he must use if the eye has suffered much during the operation and a violent inflammation is to be feared i have always found great benefit from a copious bleeding in the arm as soon as the patient is in bed whereby the blood out of a large orifice can run free and quick but according to the constitution of the patient afterward a cooling opening medicine should be given and an antiphlogistic diet be observed recommend him to be calm and to prevent as much as lies with him any thing which may produce irritation in his eye or his nervous system in case the patient has not had every day after the medicine an opening of his bowels it should be promoted by a clyster among the consequences of this operation there is one bad accident which sometimes occurs viz spasm this happens most frequently with such patients as have been very fretful before and during the operation and who are very susceptible and irritable in such habits it often happens that during or soon after the operation they begin to vomit or to have cholicky complaints or restlessness and general irritability of the whole nervous system every thing must be tried which can lessen these consequences as lukewarm pediluvia emollient clysters warm fomentations upon the belly etc and internal opiates a warm fotus of flor cham romans etc often diminishes or removes these accidents very soon as long as the patient is in this situation i should instead of applying the cold compress upon the eye use a warm fomentation viz from a decoction of flor sambuci etc etc but the surgeon who undertakes this operation must know how such accidents are to be treated  some hours after the operation perhaps eight or ten sometimes sooner or later the patient perceives a fullness and a sensible pain in the eye on which the operation has been performed and this pain is always increasing this is occasioned by the cohesion of the eyelids and of the puncta lachrymalia which hinder the tears from running out and consequently occasion a pain and pressure on the eye the surgeon should take care in this instance that the patient may not be in any needless fear this evil is in a moment cured if he makes with his finger in the inner corner of the eye upon the puncta lachrymalia a gentle and cautious rubbing in a moment the tears will run out and the patient will receive great mitigation of his anguish  the wound in the cornea unites in twelve or twentyfour hours if the patient be without pain and no accident has occurred so that nothing bad may be presumed do not open the eye before the fourth or sixth day in most cases you will find that if you open it sooner it will begin to be painful if it was even before without pain the eye always suffers in the first opening from the irritation of the light and air and the cicatrix is tender so that by the least inattention or through this irritation a spasm is produced in the muscles of the eye which make a pressure on the globe the cornea is opened again and the iris falls into the wound etc in a case of such importance to the patient and where his happiness is depending he should be cautioned against all haste and premature curiosity  i know there are some oculists who advise that the eye should be open and cleared every day immediately after the operation because they say the cornea is soon closed etc that may be a fact and i myself have had patients where i was obliged to open the eye some hours or a day after the operation and found the cornea quite closed but with so slight a degree of cohesion that the smallest pressure or the least spasm in the eye opens it again it is evident therefore that to open the eye so soon always exposes the patient to danger  every expert oculist knows and has observed that generally on the third or fifth day after the operation the patient feels more pain and even if the eye has been nearly without pain it is on this day more sensible and more hot tears gush out if the eye be not opened and left quiet this sensation soon goes away to open it at that moment would only cause a needless irritation and perhaps through it augment the inflammation  it is on the contrary as much against my opinion to keep the eye too long closed in general cases the danger of an inflammation is past the sixth or eighth day the reunion of the cornea is firm and even and the eye being rather stronger is not so much exposed to the danger of an irritation  the first time the eye is opened should be in twilight let the eyelids which cohere be first washed with lukewarm water and when they are well cleaned proceed to open the eye the patient being with his back toward the window avoid all strong light in the beginning accustom him to it cautiously and by degrees and let him make use of a shade or eyescreen in the first instance  in the use of eyewater be very cautious and if you apply any let it not be till the decrease of the inflammation because if it be used before it adds to the irritation and often augments the inflammation as soon as you permit the patient to keep his eye open let him sometimes in the day wash it with a little brandy in four or six times as much cold water if the vessels of the conjunctiva are still relaxed and full or the cicatrix of the cornea not even use sometime a solution of a few grains of white vitriol in two ounces of distilled water or a drop of the tinctura thebaic etc but the appearance must direct the operator what in such cases is to be done  the more simple the treatment of the patient the better and as soon as the eye is strong enough to bear a middling glare of light assist him with convexground spectacles recommend caution and then commit him to his own attention care and conduct  tab i fig   depiction of chair for eye surgery  fig   depiction of chair for eye
