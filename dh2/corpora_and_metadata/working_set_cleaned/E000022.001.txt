unnumbered apology for the work the following treatise was written at the desire of miss s and miss m par∣ker who were themselves educated for the purpose of educating others and on that account were originally placed in dif∣ferent seminaries for female tuition and afterwards engaged themselves for a time as teachers in other schools and in private families the better to qualify themselves for the arduous task of conducting a board∣ing school for the education of young ladies page  unnumbered about four years ago a house was offer∣ed for sale at ashborne in derbyshire at the very extremity of the town in a most pleasant and healthy situation on a dry sandy soil with excellent water well shel∣tered from the northeast and command∣ing an extensive prospect of sir brooke boothbys park and its beautiful environs a spacious walled garden adjoins the house at the bottom of which is a stream of water which may sometime be convert∣ed into a riverbath miss parkers procured this eligible situation and had the house well fitted up for the purposes of a boarding school it consists of an ample schoolroom and an ample diningroom and four smaller par∣lours page  unnumbered on the principal floor with two staircases one of which is of stone the whole is airy and well lighted and now contains about thirty pupils without being crowded they next had the good fortune to en∣gage very excellent teachers in dancing music and drawing from nottingham derby c with a polite emigrant as french master and lastly applied to me for any ideas i could furnish them with on the subject of female education and now as their establishment has succeeded to their utmost wish have expressed a desire that i would give to the public what i wrote originally for their private inspec∣tion page  unnumbered i have only to add that a copy of the manuscript has been seen by many of the ingenious of both sexes and much improv∣ed by their observations to whom i here beg leave to return my most grateful ac∣knowledgments page  unnumbered a plan for the conduct of female education section i the female character the parents and guardians of young ladies of the last half century were less solicitous about procuring for them so extensive an education as modern refine∣ment requires hence it happens that female education has not yet been reduced to a perfect system but is frequently di∣rected by those who have not themselves had a good education or who have not stu∣died the subject with sufficient attention and tho many ingenious remarks are to be page   0 found in the works of locke rousseau genlis and other writers still more mo∣dern yet few of them are exactly appli∣cable to the management of boarding schools the improvement of which is the intent of the present treatise the advantages of a good education consist in uniting health and agility of bo∣dy with cheerfulness and activity of mind in superadding graceful movements to the former and agreeable tastes to the latter and in the acquirement of the rudiments of such arts and sciences as may amuse our∣selves or gain us the esteem of others with a strict attention to the culture of mo∣rality and religion the female character should possess the mild and retiring virtues rather than the bold and dazzling ones great eminence in almost any thing is sometimes injurious to a young lady whose temper and disposi∣tion should appear to be pliant rather than page     robust to be ready to take impressions ra∣ther than to be decidedly marked as great apparent strength of character however excellent is liable to alarm both her own and the other sex and to create admira∣tion rather than affection there are however situations in single life in which after the completion of their schooleducation ladies may culti∣vate to any extent the fine arts or the sci∣ences for their amusement or instruction and there are situations in a married state which may call forth all the energies of the mind in the care education or pro∣vision for a family which the inactivity folly or death of a husband may render ne∣cessary hence if to softness of manners complacency of countenance gentle un∣hurried motion with a voice clear and yet tender the charms which enchant all hearts can be superadded internal strength and activity of mind capable to transact the business or combat the evils of life page     with a due sense of moral and religious obligation all is obtained which education can supply the female character becomes complete excites our love and commands our admiration education should draw the outline and teach the use of the pencil but the exertions of the individual must afterwards introduce the various gradations of shade and colour must illuminate the landscape and fill it with the beautiful figures of the graces and the virtues page  unnumbered section ii music and dancing are generally taught by masters who profess those arts concerning which we shall only observe that they are fre∣quently believed to be of too great impor∣tance in female education and on that ac∣count that too much time is expended on their acquirement it is perhaps more desirable that young ladies should play sing and dance only so well as to amuse themselves and their friends than to prac∣tise those arts in so eminent a degree as to astonish the public because a great appa∣rent attention to trivial accomplishments is liable to give a suspicion that more va∣luable acquisitions have been neglected and as they consist in an exhibition of the person they are liable to be attended with vanity and to extinguish the blush of youthful timidity which is in young ladies the most powerful of their exterior charms page     such masters should be chosen to in∣struct young ladies in these accomplish∣ments as are not only well qualified to sing and play or to dance themselves but also who can teach with good temper and genteel behaviour they should recollect that vulgar manners with the sharp ges∣tures of anger and its disagreeable tones of voice are unpardonable in those who profess to teach graceful motion and me∣lodious expression and may affect the taste and temper of their pupils so as to be more injurious to their education than any thing which they are able to teach them can counterbalance page  unnumbered section iii reading as reading is as much a language to the eye as speaking is to the ear it re∣quires much time and labour for children to acquire both these languages such books should therefore be put into their hands as join amusement with instruction and thus lighten the fatigue of continued application as sandford and merton pa∣rents assistant evenings at home and ma∣ny others in learning to read aloud a clear and distinct enunciation is seldom acquired at schools which is owing to the child stand∣ing close to the teacher who looks over the book along with it and hence the pupil finds no difficulty in being understood even when she pronounces only half words this however is easily remedied by placing the reader at the distance of page     two yards or more from the hearer then the young scholar soon finds that she is not understood unless she expresses her∣self with clear articulation for this pur∣pose the teacher should always be provided with a duplicate of the book she teaches that she may not be necessitated to look over the shoulder of her pupil as the young scholars advance in the knowledge of language other books must be taught them both in prose and poetry such as may improve their minds in the knowledge of things in morality religion or which may form their taste a great number of books for the use of children has been published in late years many of them by very ingenious writers and well adapted to the purpose designed of such of these as have come to my knowledge a catalogue shall be given at the end of this treatise page  unnumbered section iv writing writing as it keeps the body in a fixed posture as well as drawing and needlework should not be too long appli∣ed to at a time since the body and even the countenance may thus get a certain tendency to one attitude as is seen in children who are brought up to some me∣chanic art as in polishing buttons or pre∣cious stones on a lathe a proper manner of holding the pen or pencil or needle with an easy but graceful attitude of the person and an agreeable moderate atten∣tion of the countenance should first be taught for which purposes an inclined desk has many advantages over an horizon∣tal table for the books or working frames as the body is thence less bent forwards and the light in general situations more vi∣vidly reflected to the eye page     if the desk be sixteen inches broad the furthermost edge of it should rise about three inches and half from the horizontal line which produces the most convenient inclination and the table or frame which supports it for the use of the taller chil∣dren should rise about two feet eight inch∣es from the ground page  unnumbered section v grammar which is an abstract science teaching the texture of language is too hard for very young minds and is there∣fore generally taught too early and the same may be said of arithmetic the english grammars in general use at schools are both tedious and defective composi∣tions an epitome or extract from lowths grammar with the late improvements of mr horne tooke in the theory of lan∣guage would well supply this branch of knowledge and might be given to the public under the name of a rational english grammar mrs devis has published a small and useful rudiment of grammar purposely for the use of young ladies which may be taught as an introduction to lowths grammar the abbe gaultiers jeu de page   0 grammaire may perhaps be rendered a∣musing to children and convey to them ideas of the french grammar page  unnumbered section vi languages the necessity of learning some an∣tient or foreign languages imposes a labori∣ous task on the youth of both sexes which consumes years of their precious time which might otherwise be employed in the acquisition of sciences the difficulty of obtaining a competent knowledge of the greek or latin language is many times greater than that of obtaining any modern one as may be deduced from the innu∣merable changes of the termination of their nouns adjectives and verbs which to a beginner are all so many new words and as the works of the best writers in these languages have been translated into our own it is less necessary in the education of ladies to expend so much time and la∣bour in acquiring them but as the french and italian are less difficult to learn and contain new books of taste and knowledge page     which are yearly published in this age of literature and as they are convenient for conversing with foreigners who come hither or in our travelling into other countries and lastly as they are agree∣able as well as fashionable studies the pupils of boarding schools should be en∣couraged to attain one or both of them the method recommended by mr locke in his treatise on education sect     of teaching languages by conversa∣tion will on trial be generally found suc∣cessful in respect to modern languages with even the youngest children never∣theless a knowledge of grammar should afterwards be taught with care if the child be too young at first to attend to it for without the aid of grammar not only the french or italian languages but even the english will not always be spoken or writ∣ten with perfect accuracy for this purpose of acquiring modern languages by conversation a school gene∣rally page     supplies better opportunities than a private family besides the advantage of some degree of emulation which frequent∣ly exists where children converse to∣gether another advantage of infantine so∣ciety is that they learn many other things as well as languages by repeating them to each other and obtain what is seldom to be acquired from adult companions some knowledge of physiognomy as the passions of children are more legibly expressed on their countenances than at a maturer age this knowledge of physiognomy which is perhaps only to be acquired at schools by giving a promptitude of understanding the present approbation or dislike and the good or bad designs of those whom we con∣verse with becomes of hourly use in al∣most every department of life page  unnumbered section vii arithmetic like grammar is an abstract science which is frequently attempted to be taught too early at the same time it may be ob∣served that the early initiation of most children into card playing before they come to school by giving clear and visible ideas of the ten first numerals seems greatly to facilitate their acquirement of arithmetic and if this fashionable amusement could be so managed by the parents who allow it to their children as not to excite a desire of gain along with a contest of ingenuity it might be rendered in some measure ad∣vantageous by exciting the mind to activi∣ty in this branch of science but in never∣theless not proper to be used in schools where its effects on the passions cannot be sufficiently watched and counteracted so much of the science of numbers as is in common use as the numeration sub∣traction page     multiplication and division of money should be learnt with accuracy to which should be added the rule of three and decimal fractions which will abun∣dantly repay the labour of acquiring them by the pleasure and utility which will per∣petually result from the knowledge of them thro life the higher parts of arithme∣tic as algebra and fluxions belong to the abstruser sciences there are many introductory books to the science of arithmetic those i have heard most recommended are vises tutors guide huttons practical arithmetic and wingates arithmetic but it is probable that most of the introductory treatises to a∣rithmetic must be nearly of equal excel∣lence page  unnumbered section viii geography so much of this science as depends only on memory may be taught to chil∣dren in their early years they should be taught to point out on large maps the counties of england and then the prin∣cipal divisions of europe and of the other quarters of the world and lastly to trace out the principal rivers and mountains which ingrave or imboss its surface which is much to be preferred to dissected maps as it is the situations rather than the exact forms of counties and of countries which should be attended to afterwards the use of the globes should be explained and some short outline of astronomy ought to accompany these lectures a compendious system of geography on cards published by mr newberry in st pauls church yard supplies a very con∣venient page     method of instructing children other geographical cards by bowles tho they only mention the latitude and longi∣tude of important places may also be used with advantage the maps published by mr faden which have blank outlines to be filled up by the student are well de∣signed and not very expensive the ab∣be gaultiers cours de geographie formed into a game may like his game at gram∣mar be rendered amusing to children and are tolerably well adapted both to pri∣vate families where there are but few pu∣pils and to public seminaries of in∣struction fairmans geography a small octavo sold by johnson contains a short account of the planets and use of the globes brooks gazetteer is an useful work and some other good geographical publications are mentioned in the catalogue of books at the end of this work page  unnumbered section ix history the history of mankind is connect∣ed with the knowledge of the earth which they cultivate a summary of the history of england should precede that of other nations as it may be more interesting and more easily comprehended by english children afterwards an abridgment of the history of other nations both antient and modern may be collected from various writers but are some of them already made concise and agreeable by dr goldsmith in his histories of greece and rome as well as of england and scotland which how∣ever cannot be well remembered without a previous knowledge of geography or by consulting maps with every change of place in the account of transactions afterwards a brief but correct know∣ledge of history still more ancient and of page     chronology comprehending the four great empires of the world with the rise of the present kingdoms of europe from the fall of the last may be acquired according to the plan of mrs chapone in her letters on the improvement of the mind this out∣line of history and chronology may be rea∣dily and agreeably learned from priestleys chart of history which with his chart of biography should hang amongst a collec∣tion of large wellcoloured maps in the parlour of a boarding school that they may frequently encounter the eyes of the young students page  unnumbered section x natural history the history of the various other animals is also connected with our know∣ledge of the various parts of the earth which they inhabit this is termed na∣tural history and may be taught to chil∣dren earlier than the histories of mankind as being easier to their comprehensions and thence more interesting and agreeable to them dr goldsmith in his history of animated nature has also made this part of knowledge of easy access and mr bew∣icks account of quadrupedes with wood∣prints of the animals and amusing tale∣pieces to the sections are quite charming to children to these should be added a treatise on birds with the scientific names admirably adapted for the use of schools by mr galton published by johnson in st pauls church yard london in three small volumes and besides these children page     should be permitted occasionally to inspect the collections of foreign animals which are frequently exhibited in this country as an examination of the objects themselves conveys clearer ideas than prints and de∣scriptions and at the same time adds to their knowledge and gratifies their cu∣riosity page  unnumbered section xi the rudiments of taste are too much neglected in most boarding schools these should be taught with some care as perhaps peculiarly be∣longing to ladies since taste enters into their dress their motions their manners as well as into all the fine arts which they have leisure to cultivate as drawing paint∣ing modelling making artificial flowers embroidery writing letters reading speak∣ing and into almost every circumstance of life the general rudiments of taste are to be acquired first by reading books which treat professedly on the subject as the ten papers by mr addison on the power of imagination in the spectator vol   no     akinsides pleasures of imagination burke on the sublime and beautiful ho∣garths analysis of beauty masons english page     garden wheatleys ornamental garden∣ing and gilpins picturesque views se∣condly by selecting and explaining admir∣ed passages from classical authors as the beauties of shakespeare of johnson and of sterne and lastly by exhibiting and explaining the prints of beautiful objects or casts of the best antique gems and me∣dallions the authors above mentioned have di∣vided the objects of taste into the sub∣lime the beautiful and the new but a new sect of inquirers into this subject have lately added the picturesque which is supposed to differ from the beautiful by its want of smoothness and from the sublime from its want of size but this circumstance has not yet perhaps undergone sufficient examination—see essay on picturesque by u price others have endeavoured to make a distinction between beauty and grace and page     have esteemed them as it were rivals for the possession of the human heart but grace may be defined beauty in action for a sleeping beauty can not be called graceful in whatever attitude she may re∣cline the muscles must be in action to pro∣duce a graceful attitude and the limbs to produce a graceful motion the suppos∣ed origin of our ideas of beauty acquired in our early infancy from the curved lines which form the female bosom is deliver∣ed in zoonomia vol i sect xvi   but is too metaphysical an investigation for young ladies page  unnumbered section xii drawing and embroidery drawing as an elegant art be∣longs to the education of young ladies and greatly facilitates the acquirement of taste as this is generally taught by masters who profess it i shall only observe that tho as an art it consists of deceiving the eye yet as a science it is capable of producing to the mind the most sublime and beautiful images or the most interesting scenes of life for our amusement admiration or in∣struction the same observation applies to em∣broidery which is painting with the needle instead of the pencil and seems to have been a fashionable employment of ladies of the highest rank in the early ages of the world as the ladies in polite life have frequently much leisure time at their dis∣posal it is wise for them to learn many page     elegant as well as useful arts in their early years which they may afterward cultivate for their amusement and thus deprive solitude of irksomeness and by being able to entertain themselves they may be less solicitous to enter the circles of dissi∣pation and depend less for happiness on the caprice of others besides the amusement or accomplish∣ment of possessing the talent of drawing there is another advantage resulting from it which consists in using the pencil as a language to express the forms of all visible objects as of flowers machines houses landscapes which can not in words alone be conveyed to others with sufficient accu∣racy for this end it may be sufficient to draw in outlines alone the figures of na∣tural things without expending so much time on this art as is requisite to enable the learner to add the nice touches which form the delicate gradations of shade and colour page     it may be supposed that some know∣ledge of the science of perspective should be previously acquired for the purpose of drawing the outlines of objects but i sus∣pect that this is not always necessary since at our learning to see before we have compared the ideas received by the sense of sight with those received by that of touch any object placed before our eyes as suppose the face of a companion must appear a flat coloured or shaded surface and not a solid substance covered with emi∣nences and depressions as is so well proved by bishop berkley in his theory of vision hence if any one could so far unlearn the language of sight as to imagine the face of his companion to be a flat co∣loured surface only as it is really seen he would draw from nature as easily and exactly as if he was copying a picture as the inequalities would appear lights and shades and he would thus be enabled to take the likeness with much greater facili∣ty and accuracy without the aid of the rules of perspective page  unnumbered section xiii the heathen mythology is connected with the study of taste and should therefore be taught in boarding schools as without some knowledge of it the works of the painters statuarists and poets both antient and modern can not be understood but as a great part of this mythology consists of personified vices much care should be taken in female schools as well as in male ones to prevent any bad impressions which might be made on the mind by this kind of erudition this is to be accomplished by explaining the allegorical meaning of many of these supposed actions of heathen deities and by shewing that they are at present used only as emblems of certain powers as mi∣nerva of wisdom and bellona of war and thus constitute the language of painters and are indeed almost the whole language which that art possesses besides the delinea∣tion of visible objects in rest or in action page     these emblems however are not to be so easily acquired by descriptions alone nor so easily remembered by young pupils as when prints of antique statues or me∣dallions or when cameos or impressions of antique gems are at the same time shewn and explained to them for this purpose the prints of spences polymetis may be exhibited and explained from which bells pantheon is principally ta∣ken and dannets dictionary of mytho∣logy originally written in french may be occasionally consulted and the notes on mr popes translations of homer there is also a little book intitled instructions sur les metamorphoses par m le ragois which i am informed is an useful and unexceptionable work for this purpose containing a kind of summa∣ry of each story of fabulous mythology to which may be added a translation of ovids metamorphoses published by garth which i am told is the 〈…〉 page   0 work much agreeable knowledge of this kind is to be found in byrants mythology abbe de pluches history of the heavens warburtons essay on eleusinian mysteries to which i beg leave to add the descrip∣tion of the portland vase in the notes to the first volume of the botanic garden page  unnumbered section xiv polite literature may be divided into dissertations plays romances poems each of which if the works are properly selected may af∣ford amusement and instruction to young persons of some of the books of each of these classes of literature a catalogue will be given at the end of the work such dissertations as have been gene∣rally admired may be selected from the spectator tatler guardian the world the rambler adventurer lookeron besides many others plays are of three kinds tragical sen∣timental and humourous of the first addisons cato has been long admired and the tragedies of thompson consist of fine language of the second kind cumber∣lands comedies are instances and of the page     third sheridans comedies some of which are entertaining and inoffensive and may be read by young ladies without injury to their morals or much outrage to their feelings there are many plays which are bet∣ter seen as exhibited on the stage than as read in the closet because the objectiona∣ble passages are generally omitted in the representation but whether young la∣dies should be taught to act plays them∣selves as is done at some boys schools is a matter of doubt the danger consists in this lest the acquisition of bolder ac∣tion and a more elevated voice should an∣nihilate that retiring modesty and blush∣ing embarrassment to which young ladies owe one of their most powerful external charms if young ladies act plays amongst them∣selves only or without admitting more than two or three of their friends or pa∣rents page     or if they repeat chosen scenes of plays or speeches only much of the above objection ceases and some advantages may result to their attitudes or enunciation madam de genlis theatre deducation affords the least exceptionable whole plays with the sacred dramas of miss moore and of metastasio   novels or romances may be divid∣ed into the serious the humourous and the amorous of these the last should be intirely interdicted but the first when well managed may convey instruction in the most agreeable and forcible manner such as mr days sandford and merton the childrens friend tales of the cas∣tle robinson crusoe edward by the author of zelucco and to these may be added some other modern novels the pro∣ductions of ingenious ladies which are i believe less objectionable than many others as the evelina cecilia and ca∣milla of miss burney the emmeline page     and ethelinda of charlotte smith inch∣balds simple story mrs brooks emily montague and the female quixote all which i have here introduced from the character given to me of them by a very ingenious lady not having myself read them with sufficient attention and last∣ly the humorous novels which are not written to inflame the passions convey in∣struction as far as they are imitations of real life of these are le sages famous novel of gil blas and fieldings tom jones neither of which however are pro∣per books for young readers there are many who condemn the use of novels altogether but what are epic po∣ems but novels in verse—it is difficult to draw the line of limit between novels and other works of imagination unless the word novel be confined to mean only the romances of love and chivalry it is true indeed that almost all novels as well as plays and epic poems have some page     exceptional passages to be found in them which might therefore be expunged be∣fore they are allowed to be read by young ladies but are young women therefore to be kept in intire ignorance of mankind with whom they must shortly associate and from whom they are frequently to choose a partner for life this would be making them the slaves rather than the companions of men like the sultanas of a turkish seraglio and how can young women who are secluded from the other sex from their infancy form any judgment of men if they are not to be assisted by such books as delineate manners—a lady of fortune who was persuaded by her guar∣dian to marry a disagreeable and selfish man speaking to her friend of the ill humour of her husband lamented that she had been prohibited from reading novels if i had read such books said she before i was married i should have chosen bet∣ter i was told that all men were alike except in respect to fortune  page     we must however observe that novels are perhaps more objectionable in schools than in private education as the com∣ments of one bad mind may be dangerous to the whole community and as they are more amusing to young people than any other books if read too early they may give a distaste to more useful knowledge which are good reasons for the total prohi∣bition of them in schools and in private education lest a preference of fiction to truth should be thus instilled the ridicu∣lous passages with which even the best no∣vels abound should be carefully pointed out by a friend or governess with their exaggerations improbabilities and fre∣quent deviations from nature there are indeed few books which delineate manners whether in prose or poetry however well chosen which have not some objectionable passages in them in reading the fables of esop mr rousseau well observes that the effect page     on the mind may frequently be totally dif∣ferent from that designed by the author as in the fable where the fox flatters the crow and gains the piece of cheese the moral was designed to shew the folly of at∣tending to flatterers but may equally be supposed to applaud the cunning of the fox or flatterer who is rewarded in the popular narrative of robinson crusoe a childish superstition concerning intima∣tions of future events somewhat like the second sight of the highlands of scotland is frequently inculcated and the use of rum or brandy is proposed as an infallible cure in all maladies which however i am told is corrected in the new robinson crusoe pamela and joseph andrews and cla∣rissa harlow are recommended by ma∣dame de genlis and by mrs macawley— madame de genlis in a note in one of her works gives her reason for recommending richardsons novels because his heroines page     retain a more considerable degree of com∣mand over their affections than those of apparently less exceptionable romances in this respect a novel called plain sense lately published by lane and written by an ingenious cheshire lady claims the preference to all others and ap∣pears to me to carry this idea to excess the works of richardson are never∣theless not only too voluminous and thence would consume too much time which might be better employed in schools but in these and even in mr popes rape of the lock and his eloisa to abelard many objectionable passages of another kind may be discovered if these passages from which so few books are totally exempt were expunged it might raise curiosity and induce young people to examine dif∣ferent copies of the same work and to seek for other improper books themselves it is therefore perhaps better when these books are read to a governess that page     she should express disapprobation in a plain and quiet way of such passages ra∣ther than to expunge them which would give a feeling of dislike to the pupil and confirm her delicacy rather than give im∣purity to her ideas much therefore depends on the con∣duct of the governess in this respect so long as they are under the eye of a judi∣cious monitor no real harm could proba∣bly arise from their seeing human nature in all the classes of life not only as it should be or as it may be imagined to be but as it really exists since without comparison there can be no judgment and consequent∣ly no real knowledge it must nevertheless be observed that the excessive study of novels is universally an ill employment at any time of life not only because such readers are liable to ac∣quire a romantic taste and to return from the flowery scenes of fiction to the com∣mon page   0 duties of life with a degree of regret but because the highwrought scenes of elegant distress displayed in novels have been found to blunt the feelings of such readers towards real objects of misery which awaken only disgust in their minds instead of sentiments of pity or benevo∣lence   the works of the poets as well as those of the writers of novels require to be selected with great caution the same may be said of painting sculpture and music which by delighting the imagina∣tion influence the judgment and may thence be employed either to good or bad purposes but as poetry when thus select∣ed like painting sculpture and music its rival sisters is an object of refined taste and affords an elegant amusement at least it so far belongs to the education of young ladies gays fables thomsons seasons gis∣bornes walk in a forest are proper for the page     younger classes of pupils afterwards popes ethic epistles and essay on man goldsmiths poems akinside mason gray and others which are enumerated in the catalogue i forbear to mention the bo∣tanic garden as some ladies have intimat∣ed to me that the loves of the plants are described in too glowing colours but as the descriptions are in general of female forms in graceful attitudes the objection is less forcible in respect to female readers and besides the celebrated poets of our own country as milton and shakespeare tran∣slations from the antients as from homer and virgil and from the more modern poems of tasso and camoens may be read with pleasure and improvement tho some objectionable passages may perhaps be found in all of them   for the purpose of forming a style in writing a few wellchosen books should be read often over till the ear acquires as it were the musick of the sentences page     and the imagination is thus enabled to co∣py it in our own compositions such as those papers of the spectator which are ascribed to addison and are terminated with a capital letter of the word clio or some of lady wortley montagues letters from turkey or other works of chaste distinct and expressive style not overload∣ed with metaphors which with superabun∣dance of ornament injure perspicuity but for other purposes of education it is perhaps better to teach young people select parts of many books than a few en∣tire ones not only because the pupils will thus be acquainted with more authors in fashionable literature but because the business of polite education is to give the outlines of many species of erudition or branches of knowledge which the young ladies may cultivate further at their future leisure without the assistance of a teacher as may best suit their tastes or their situa∣tions page     i cannot conclude this section on po∣lite learning without mentioning that some illiterate men have condemned the cultivation of the minds of the female sex and have called such in ridicule learned ladies as if it was a reproach to render themselves agreeable and useful where affectation is joined with learning it be∣comes pedantry but this belongs oftener to the ignorant than to the cultivated as is so well elucidated in letters to literary ladies a small duodecimo published by johnson and written by one of the inge∣nious family of e—in ireland page  unnumbered section xv arts and sciences besides the acquisition of gram∣mar languages and common arithmetic and besides a knowledge of geography ci∣vil history and natural history there are other sciences an outline of which might be taught to young ladies of the higher classes of the school or of more inquiring minds before or after they leave school which might not only afford them present amusement but might enable them at any future time to prosecute any of them fur∣ther if inclination and opportunity should coincide and by enlarging their sphere of taste and knowledge would occasion them to be interested in the conversation of a greater number and of more ingenious men and to interest them by their own conversation in return   an outline of botany may be learnt from lees introduction to botany and page     from the translations of the works of lin∣naeus by a society at lichfield to which might be added curtiss botanical maga∣zine which is a beautiful work and of no great expence but there is a new treatise introductory to botany called botanic dia∣logues for the use of schools well adapted to this purpose written by m e jacson a lady well skilled in botany and publish∣ed by johnson london and lastly i shall not forbear to mention that the philo∣sophical part of botany may be agreeably learnt from the notes to the second volume of the botanic garden whether the poetry be read or not   an outline of chemistry which surprizes and enchants us may be learnt from the elements of chemistry by la∣voisier originally published in french to which may be added a small work of fourcroy called the philosophy of chemis∣try the former of these illustrious che∣mists perished by the guillotine an irre∣parable loss to science and to mankind page     the acquirement of chemistry should be preceded by a sketch of mineralogy which is not only an interesting branch of science as it teaches the knowledge of dia∣monds and precious stones and of the va∣rious mines of metals coals and salt but because it explains also the difference of soils and is thus concerned in the theory and practice of agriculture but there is at present no proper introductory book that i know of on this subject for the use of children as cronstedts and bergmans and kirwans mineralogy are too exact and prolix nor could be well understood with∣out a small collection of fossils   an outline of the sciences to which mathematics have generally been applied as of astronomy mechanics hydrostatics and optics with the curious addition of electricity and magnetism may best be ac∣quired by attending the lectures in experi∣mental philosophy which are occasion∣ally exhibited by itinerant philosophers page     and which have almost exclusively acquir∣ed the name of natural philosophy the books in common use for teaching these sciences are too difficult and abstruse for the study of young persons some parts of natural philosophy are rendered not unentertaining in the notes of the first volume of the botanic garden as the the∣ory of meteors and of winds and an ac∣count of the strata of the earth which nevertheless require too much attention for very young ladies but may be read with pleasure after leaving school by those who possess inquiring minds it is to be wished that some writer of juvenile books would endeavour easily to explain the structure and use of the barometer and thermometer and of clocks and watches which supply a part of the furniture of our houses and of our pockets   in the same manner the various arts and manufactories which adorn and page     enrich this country should occasionally be shewn and explained to young persons as so many ingenious parts of experimental philosophy as well as from their imme∣diately contributing to the convenience of life and to the wealth of the nations which have invented or established them of these are the cotton works on the river derwent in derbyshire the potteries in staffordshire the ironfounderies of coal∣brooke dale in shropshire the manufac∣tories of birmingham manchester not∣tingham but these are not in the province of a boarding school but might be advan∣tageously exhibited to young ladies by their parents in the summer vacations   in this section of arts and sciences it may be proper to mention the art of producing a technical memory invented by mr gray which may be readily ac∣quired by consulting his book and may perhaps be of advantage in remembering dates or numbers as they are expressed page     by letters and formed into words this work i attended to in my youth but found it an amusing trick rather than an useful art   the art of writing shorthand which is said to be of english invention should also be mentioned in this place the book i learned this art from was pub∣lished by gurney and said to be an im∣provement on mason other treatises of shorthand i have also examined but found them all nearly of equal excellence i can only add that many volumes which i wrote from medical lectures i now find difficult to decypher and that as the words in shorthand are spelt from their sound only those scholars who practise this art early in life are liable not afterwards to spell our language correctly and lastly that i believe this art is still capable of improvement by first forming a more ac∣curate alphabet than that in common use among all european nations page   0   this section on arts and sciences may perhaps be thought to include more branches of them than is necessary for fe∣male erudition but as in male education the tedicus acquirement of antient lan∣guages for the purpose of studying poetry and oratory is gradually giving way to the more useful cultivation of modern sciences it may be of advantage to ladies of the ris∣ing generation to acquire an outline of si∣milar knowledge as they are in future life to become companions and one of the greatest pleasures received in conversation consists in being reciprocally well under∣stood botany is already a fashionable study for ladies and chemistry is ingeniously re∣commended to them in the letters to lite∣rary ladies page  unnumbered section xvi morals the criterion of moral duties has been variously delivered by different wri∣ters expediency by which is meant whatever increases the sum of public hap∣piness is by some called the criterion of virtue and whatever diminishes that sum is termed vice by others the happiness or misery of the individual if rightly un∣derstood is said to be the bond of moral obligation and lastly by others the will of god is said to constitute the sole crite∣rion of virtue and vice but besides systematic books of morali∣ty which are generally too abstruse for young minds morals may be divided into five departments for the greater convenien∣cy of the manner of instruction  • page      •   a sympathy with the pains and pleasures of others or compassion  •   a strict regard to veracity  •   prudence justice chastity  •   fortitude  •   temperance page  unnumbered section xvii compassion a sympathy with the pains and pleasures of others is the foundation of all our social virtues do as you would be done by is a precept which descended from heaven whoever feels pain him∣self when he sees others affected with it will not only never be liable to give pain but will always be inclined to relieve it the lady who possesses this christian vir∣tue of compassion cannot but be a good daughter a good wife and a good mother that is an amiable character in every de∣partment of life the manner of communicating this benevolent sympathy to children consists in expressing our own sympathy when any thing cruel presents itself as in the de∣struction of an insect or when actions of page     cruelty are related in books or in conversa∣tion i once observed a lady with appa∣rent expressions of sympathy say to her lit∣tle daughter who was pulling off the legs of a fly how should you like to have your arms and legs pulled off would it not give you great pain pray let it fly away out of the window which i doubt not would make an indelible impression on the child and lay the foundation of an amiable character  this virtue of compassion is a certain foundation of benevolence and on that account renders children good to their own parents in the latter part of their lives as well as to all other people an important circumstance to the happiness of our latter years where cruelty or malevolence resides in the breast it is generally exercis∣ed most by the child upon the aged parent with whom in civilized society he frequent∣ly resides and who often lives so long as to stand in his way to the possession of a wishedfor inheritance page     this compassion or sympathy with the pains of others ought also to extend to the brute creation as far as our necessities will admit for we cannot exist long without the destruction of other animal or vegetable beings either in their nature or embryon state such is the condition of mortality that the first law of nature is eat or be eaten hence for the preservation of our existence we may be supposed to have a natural right to kill those brute creatures which we want to eat or which want to eat us but to destroy even insects wantonly shews an unreflecting mind or a depraved heart a young gentleman once assured me that he had lately fallen in love with a young lady but on their walking out one evening in summer she took two or three steps out of her way on the gravel walk to tread upon an insect and that afterwards whenever the idea of her came into his mind it was attended with this picture of page     active cruelty till that of the lady ceased to be agreeable and he relinquished his design of courtship nevertheless this sympathy however amiable and necessary may be carried to an extreme so as to render miserable the person who possesses it since many piti∣able objects must be seen in our journey through life which we have not power to relieve this then furnishes us with a barrier or line where to stop that is we should endeavour to render our little pu∣pils alive to sympathize with all remedia∣ble evils and at the same time to arm them with fortitude to bear the sight of such irremediable evils as the accidents of life must frequently present before their eyes there should also be a plan in schools to promote the habit as well as the prin∣ciple of benevolence each young lady might occasionally contribute a small sum page     on seeing a needy naked child to purchase flannel or coarse linen for clothes which they might learn to cut out and to make up themselves and thus the practice of in∣dustry might be united with that of libe∣rality another still more practical mode of producing a habit of benevolence in chil∣dren might be by inducing them to em∣ploy some leisure hours in little works of taste as in making artificial flowers purses fringes and bestowing these on poor peo∣ple in order that they might sell them for their support miss hartley at bath the daughter of the great medical philosopher of that name has lately exhibited an amia∣ble example of this kind of philanthropy she has been long distinguished by her ta∣lents as an artist in painting and has late∣ly distributed her elegant performances among the poor famished emigrants who reside in her neighbourhood who are thus greatly assisted by the sale of her works page     another channel in which this sym∣pathy should be taught to flow is in the observance of those attentions which per∣petually diffuse happiness by promoting by courtesy of behaviour the cheerfulness or forwarding by ready assistance the interests of those whether equals inferiors or su∣periors with whom every one happens to associate or reside which constitutes the essential part of what is termed politeness of manners and universally indicates a benevolent disposition page  unnumbered section xviii veracity for the purpose of inculcating a love of truth early in life the love of praise supplies the most certain means this kind of honour has an honest pride for its basis a story is related in one of the mo∣dern volumes of the universal history of an inhabitant of constantinople who was brought to the scaffold for denying the divine mission of mahomet and on hav∣ing a pardon offered him if he would then declare his error answered that he would not speak an untruth to save his life and i think it is recorded that one of the fathers of the church used to affirm that he would not tell a lie were he sure to gain heaven by it page   0 i once heard an ingenious lady say to a company of her friends that her daugh∣ter a young girl who stood by with a countenance flushed with pleasure never told her a lie in her life this happy use of flattery was likely to produce a love for veracity which would never be destroyed by interested motives the disgrace of telling a lie should be painted in vivid colours as totally de∣structive of the character of a lady or gen∣tleman rendering them contemptible in the eyes of the world and the inconve∣nience of this detestable habit of lying should be explained from its preventing their being believed when they wish it as is exemplified in the fable of the shepherdboy who called out the wolf the wolf so often to alarm his neighbours and thus to amuse himself when no wolf was near that when the real wolf attacked his flock he could by no vociferation prevail on any page     one to come to his assistance or like the villagedrunkard who frequently a∣mused himself with crying out fire along the streets on his return from the alehouse in the night to the great alarm of the neighbourhood till at length when his cottage was really in flames his distress was not believed and he could gain no assistance to extinguish them this sincerity of character should be confirmed by the example of the gover∣nesses who should themselves pay the most exact and scrupulous attention to truth they should not exaggerate trifling errors into reprehensible faults and where re∣proof is necessary should give it with kind∣ness and should not only punctually ful∣fil their own promises tho to their incon∣venience but exact the same from their pupils in return to these should be added the precepts of religion as soon as their minds are ca∣pable page     of receiving them which uniformly inculcate truth and probity in all our words and actions page  unnumbered section xix prudence justice chastity the impressions on the mind made by recent examples placed as it were be∣fore our eyes have so much more durable effects than the more abstracted ideas de∣livered in systems of moral philosophy that i believe the most efficacious method of inculcating the virtue of prudence in respect to their own conduct is by telling young people the ill consequences which have lately happened to others whose per∣sons or names they are acquainted with so that a repetition of the slander of a town which always degrades the retailers has sometimes its advantage as a lesson to the hearers there is another kind of prudence which it is necessary to acquire in some de∣gree page     which arms the possessor against the ill designs of others hence they should be taught to beware of flatterers gamesters drunkards and of all illtempered persons as this prudence is to be acquired by the knowledge of mankind such books as the maxims of rochfoucault and others might be recommended but they give too gloo∣my a picture of human nature to be put in∣to the hands of young ladies know yourself is a celebrated in∣junction and may constitute one depart∣ment of prudence when any one under∣takes some great action or great change in the condition of life but know other people is equally necessary in passing along this sublunary world and may be inserted with propriety as another maxim in the code of prudence the facility of know∣ing others in the daily intercourse of the world is produced by the knowledge of physiognomy acquired at schools in early life while the passions continue to be im∣pressed page     on the countenances of children and which is never so well acquired in pri∣vate tuition and thus constitutes one of the great advantages of schooleducation justice and chastity which are the principal links by which civilized society is held together are to be inculcated in young minds by similar methods that is by pointing out by examples the public punishment or public disgrace which cer∣tainly accompanies the breach of either of these important duties and afterwards to add the precepts of religion when their minds are capable of perceiving their force to cooperate with the effect of the laws of society and of the opinion of the wise and virtuous page  unnumbered section xx fortitude if female children are not treated with tenderness by a mother in their early years of infancy they are perhaps liable to acquire a harshness of character and an ap∣parent unfeelingness which afterwards renders them less amiable though it may give them greater fortitude which should therefore be inculcated at their rather ma∣turer years neither the robust assailing courage which prompts to the performance of he∣roic actions nor the ostentatious patience which requires the flattery of the public eye for its support belong to the female character but that serene strength of mind which faces unavoidable danger with open eyes prepared to counteract or page     to bear the necessary evils of life is equal∣ly valuable as a male or female acquisition this is termed presence of mind it de∣pends on our judgment of the real value of things and on our application of those causes which contribute to turn disagreea∣ble circumstances to the best advantage and can therefore only be acquired by the general cultivation of good sense and of knowledge an occasional effusion of tears has been thought an amiable weakness and a mark of delicacy of the sex when tears are shed at the irremediable misfortunes of others it indicates an amiable sensibility but when young ladies indulge themselves in a promptitude of dissolving into inces∣sant tears at every trivial distress of their own it shews a kind of infantine debility of mind and conveys an idea of their being unfit for the common duties of life and should therefore be discouraged by reason∣ing on the kind and quantity of the evil page     which disturbs them and by reciting to them the examples of fortitude exhibited by others in disasters much more calamit∣ous of which there are examples in the letters of lady russel and lastly by re∣minding them of the consolations of reli∣gion a slight appearance of timidity has been esteemed another mark of delicacy of the sex but timidity is the companion of debility of mind rather than of delica∣cy and should not therefore be encoura∣ged in respect to the expressions of fear the violent cries and distorted countenan∣ces of some ladies in situations of danger exhibit them in no very amiable attitudes while they increase the confusion and may be said to help the storm but if to these be added an affectation of fear without cause as when a young lady screams through the whole gamut at the sight of a spider or a grasshopper the fault becomes voluntary and should be page     opposed and conquered by the shafts of ridicule impudence in common language has been termed boldness and bashfulness has been ascribed to timidity but neither of them with sufficient precision as brave men have been known to be bashful and cowards impudent assurance of counte∣nance arises from the possessor of it rather overvaluing his own abilities and impu∣dence consists in this assurance with a to∣tal disregard of the opinions of others but neither of them bear any analogy to fortitude on the other hand modesty arises from the possessor of it rather under∣valuing his own abilities and bashfulness consists in this modesty with great solici∣tude about the opinions of others but nei∣ther of them are attended with personal fear so charming is the appearance of this great sensibility by adding a blush to the features of beauty that no endeavours should be used to extinguish it early in page   0 life nor should any means be contrived to increase it to excess as embarrassment both of thought and action and even im∣pediment of speech is then liable to at∣tend the great anxiety it occasions page  unnumbered section xxi temperance includes the subjugation of the appetites and passions to reason and prudence it consists in our moderation in the use of all those things which con∣tribute to the convenience comfort or en∣joyment of life as of food dress plea∣sures and in the restraining our licenti∣ous passions as of anger vanity love am∣bition the method to instil this virtue is by exhibiting the various inconvenien∣ces which attend unlimited indulgence and thus to inculcate the golden rule of nothing to excess the example of the governess will have great effect in producing many of the page     virtues above mentioned in the minds of her pupils justice in the most trivial circumstance must be carefully and exact∣ly done between children in respect to each other in their little disputes at play moderation and selfgovernment should al∣so constantly appear in the characters of those who are to teach these virtues to others page  unnumbered section xxii religion the precepts of religion are best taught by requiring the young pupils regu∣larly to attend such places of divine worship as their parents direct and by reading on sundays select parts of the holy scriptures and some approved books of sermons as those of blair and a few others and by inculating the reasonableness of daily thanksgiving and the duty of daily pray∣er to the great author of all good the divine morality delivered in the new testament should be repeatedly incul∣cated to an infant audience who cannot so well understand the metaphysical parts of religion such as the duty of doing to others page     as we would they should do unto us to love our neighbours as ourselves to for∣give injuries not to revenge them and to be kind even to our enemies for this purpose the sermons of the old whole du∣ty of man are recommended one of which might be read every sunday evening ladies of more mature years or who have finished their schooleducation may learn the necessity and usefulness of our ex∣cellent religion from baron hallers letters to his daughter from lady penningtons advice to her daughter and lastly from mr gisbornes duties of the female sex and the defence of the truth of it may be learn∣ed from mr payleys evidences of christi∣anity but perhaps it is better for them not to perplex their minds with many works of religious controversy page  unnumbered section xxiii address there is a fascinating manner in the address of some people which almost instantly conciliates the good will and even the confidence of their acquaintance ma∣chiavel in his history of castruccio castri∣cani observes that his hero could assume such openness of countenance that though he was known to be a man practised in every kind of fraud and treachery yet in a few minutes he gained the confidence of all whom he conversed with they went away satisfied of his good will towards them and were betrayed to their ruin this enviable address which may be used for good purposes as well as for bad ones may be difficult to analize but may possibly consist simply in a countenance ani∣mated page     with pleasure at meeting and con∣versing with our acquaintance and which diffuses cheerfulness by pleasurable conta∣gion into the bosoms of others and thus in∣terests them in our behalf it is not the smile of flattery nor the smile of selfap∣probation nor the smile of habit nor of le∣vity but it is simply an expression of plea∣sure which seems to arise at the fight of our acquaintance and which persuades them that they possess our love and for which they barter their own in return however this conciliating manner may have been used as above related for bad pur∣poses it probably proceeded originally from friendliness and openness of heart with cheerful benevolence and that in those who have in process of time become bad characters the appearance of those vir∣tues has remained after the reality of them has vanished what then is the method by which this inchantment of countenance can be taught certainly by instilling cheer∣fulness page     and benevolence into the minds of young ladies early in life and at the same time an animation of countenance in ex∣pressing them and though this pleasurable animation be at first only copied it will in time have the appearance of being natural and will contribute to produce by associa∣tion the very cheerfulness and benevolence which it at first only imitated this is a golden observation to those who have the care of young children a very accomplished lady who read the manuscript of this work wrote the sol∣lowing with her pencil on the opposite page nothing can be more just and interesting than the whole of this section yet however desirable it may be to mend an unpleasant abord might one not suspect since nature has produced a diversity of manner that an attempt to engraft this beautiful cheerful∣ness on a grave set of features might produce the worst of evil affectations a natural sim∣plicity of manner whether serious or gay page     will always please and probably this amia∣ble address may be rendered equally consist∣ent with natural manners whether serious or gay page  unnumbered section xxiv conversation next to the winning manners above described the art of pleasing in conversa∣tion seems to consist in two things one of them to hear well and the other to speak well the perpetual appearance of attention and the varying expression of the countenance of the hearer to the sentiments or passions of the speaker is a principal charm in con∣versation to be well heard and accurately understood encourages our companions to proceed with pleasure whatever may be the topics of their discourse those who have been educated at schools and have learnt the knowledge of physiognomy from their playfellows in their early years understand the pleasurable or painful fellings of all with whom they com∣verse page   0 often even before their words are fi∣nished and by thus immediately conform∣ing the expression of their own features to the sensations of the speaker become the interesting and animated companions a∣bove described which is seldom seen in those educated in private families and which as before observed gives a pre∣ference to schooleducation to speak agreeably in respect to manner consists in a voice clear yet not loud soft yet not plaintive with dis∣tinct articulation and with graceful atti∣tudes rather than with graceful actions as almost every kind of gesticulation is disagreeable in respect to the matter it should be such as coincides with the tastes or pursuits of those to whom the conversation is addressed from hence it will appear that both to hear well and to speak well requires an extensive knowledge of things as well as of the tastes and pursuits of mankind and must page     therefore ultimately be the effect of a good education in general rather than a particular article of it there are however faults to be a∣voided and cautious to be observed in the conversation of young ladies which should be pointed out to them by the go∣verness of a boarding school of these i shall mention first that whenever the thirst of shining in conversation seizes on the heart the vanity of the speaker be∣comes apparent and we are disgusted with the manner whatever may be the matter of the discourse secondly that it is always childish and generally ridiculous when young people boast of their follies or when they accuse themselves of virtues nei∣ther of which they probably possess in the degree which they describe a young lady was heard to say i am frightened to death at the sight of a page     bird and another that she was so in∣considerate as to give her money to the poor naked children whom she saw in the streets in winter thirdly they should be apprized that there is danger in speaking ill even of a bad person both because they may have been misinformed and because they should judge their neighbours with charity a friend of mine was once asked by a young man how he could distinguish whether the lady whom he meant to address was good tempered and gave this answer when any du∣bious accusation is brought in conversa∣tion against an absent person if she al∣ways inclines to believe the worst side of the question she is illtempered there are some nice distinctions on this subject of good nature delivered in lady pen∣ningtons advice to her daughters which are worth a young ladys attention page     fourthly that it is dangerous for a young lady to speak very highly in praise even of a deserving man for if she ex∣tols his actions she will seem to give her∣self the importance of a judge and her determinations will sometimes be called in question and to commend highly the person of a man is in general estimation inconsistent with the delicacy of the sex at any age fifthly young ladies should be ad∣vised not to accustom themselves to the use of strong asseverations or of a kind of petty oaths such as upon my ho∣nour in their conversation nor often to appeal to others for the truth of what they affirm since all such strong expres∣sions and appeals derogate somewhat from the character of the speaker as they give an intimation that she has not been usually believed on her simple as∣sertion page     sixthly laughing vehemently aloud or tittering with short shrieks in which some young ladies who have left school indulge themselves at cards or other a∣musements are reprehensible as their dignity of character must suffer by appear∣ing too violently agitated at trivial circum∣stances seventhly and uniform adherence to sincerity in conversation is of the first im∣portance as without it our words are but empty sounds and can no more interest our companions than the tinkling of a bell no artificial polish of manners can com∣pensate for the apparent want of this vir∣tue nor any acquirements of knowledge for the reality of the want of it hence though the excess of blame or praise of the actions of others may be imprudent or im∣proper in the conversation of young la∣dies as mentioned in the third and fourth articles of this section yet in these as in all other kinds of conversation their opini∣ons page     should be given with truth if given at all but when the character 〈…〉 are concerned they should 〈…〉 with diffidence and modesty lastly if at any time any improper dis∣course should be addressed to young ladies which has a tendency to indecency im∣morality or irreligion they should be taught to express a marked disapprobation both in words and countenance so great is the power of the soster sex in meliora∣ting the characters of men that if such was their uniform behaviour i doubt not but that it would much contribute to reform the morals of the age an event de∣voutly to be wished and which would con∣tribute much to their own happiness to these might be added many other observations from the writers on female education concerning a due respect in conversation to superiors good temper to page     equals and condescension to inferiors but as young ladies are not expected to speak with the wisdom or precision of philosophers and as the careless cheerful∣ness of their conversation with simplicity of manner and with the grace ease and vivacity natural to youth supplies it with its principal charms these should be par∣ticularly encouraged as there are few ar∣tificial accomplishments which could com∣pensate for the loss of them page  unnumbered section xxv exercise the acquirements of literature and of many arts make the lives of young peo∣ple too sedentary which impairs their strength makes their countenances pale and bloated and lays the foundation of many diseases hence some hours should every day be appropriated to bodily exer∣cises and to relaxation of mind such as tend to produce activity and to promote the growth of the person in res∣pect to height are preferred in the schools for young ladies to those which render the system more robust and muscular of these playing at ball at shuttlecock swinging as they sit on a cord or cushion page     and dancing in the open air in summer and within doors in winter are to be pre∣ferred to these some have recommend∣ed an exercise of the arms by swinging lead∣en weights which are called dumb bells these should be very light if they be used at all otherwise they load the spine of the back and render the shoulders thick and muscular and rather impede than forward the perpendicular growth of the person the ringing of a real bell hung as is done in churches or the frequent drawing up of a weight by a cord over a pulley with a flywheel to prevent its too hasty descent would be an exercise which might be used with great advantage by young people as it both extends the spine and strengthens the muscles of the chest and arms many other kinds of exercise have been recommended by authors madame gen∣lis advises weights to be carried on the head as milkmaids carry their milkpails page     and even to add weights to the soles of the shoes of children to strengthen as she sup∣poses the muscles of locomotion in walk∣ing or running it is evident that carry∣ing weights on the head must be injurious to young people especially when there is a tendency to softness of the bones as it may contribute to bend the spine by their pressure and to impede the perpendicular growth of the body and the walking in weighted shoes may induce awkward ges∣tures without any adequate advantage there are other modes of exertion which though graceful in themselves are not allowed to ladies by the fashion of this age and country as skating on the ice in winter swimming in summer funambula∣tion or dancing on the streight rope but walking with a stately measured step occa∣sionally like the march of soldiers and reading aloud frequently rather in a thea∣tric manner as well as dancing and singing page   00 will much contribute to give strength and grace to the muscles of locomotion and of vocality page  unnumbered section xxvi air the strength and activity of young people not only depends on the perpetual exercise of their limbs as described in the preceding sections but on the purity of the air which they breathe and even on the occasional coldness of it the cold air of winter acts on delicate people like a cold bath as it diminishes the action of the sub∣cutaneous vessels for a time and thus pro∣duces an accumulation of animal power whence an increased action of those vessels and a consequent warmth of the surface of the body succeeds and by this less expen∣diture of animal power during immersion in cold air and its consequent accumula∣tion the person becomes stronger for a time and more animated which is termed page   0  in common language bracing the sys∣tem hence to strengthen delicate chil∣dren they should be encouraged to go into the cold air of winter frequently but should not remain in it longer than a quarter or half an hour at a time in summer young people can scarcely continue too much in the air where they are shaded from the heat of the sun a constant immersion in pure air is now known to contribute much both to the health of the system and to the beau∣tiful colour of the complexion and this atmosphere should undergo a perpetual change and renovation that the vital air which constitutes about onefourth part of it may not be too much diminished by frequent respiration due attention should be given to this important circumstance both by frequently urging the young la∣dies to amuse themselves out of doors and by the proper ventilation of the schoolroom diningroom bedrooms and page   0  their other apartments for this purpose it is convenient to saw off about one inch from the top of every door of these crowd∣ed rooms and opposite to this aperture to nail along the top of the door a tin plate about two inches wide rising at an angle of about fortyfive degrees which will bend the current of air up towards the ceil∣ing where it will be mixed with the warm air of the room and sink down a∣mongst the society without the danger of giving cold to any one and besides these doorventilators the upper sashes of every window should always be let down a few inches when the external weather will admit of it in respect to bed rooms which have more than one bed the doors should be furnished with similar ventilators for the due admission of fresh air and during the summermonths a window should be kept a few inches open during the night as well as the day the sash of which should have page   0  a bolt or other proper fastening for this purpose nor should the fireplace be stopt up at any season by a chimneyboard or a bag of straw as many rooms are made to shut up so close that this is the only aperture by which fresh air is admitted to this should be added that the bedcurtains should never be drawn close round the beds which confine the air spoiled by frequent respiration and the perspirable matter like a noxious at∣mosphere over the unconscious sleepers at the same time none of the beds should be placed very near either to an open win∣dow or to an open chimney as a partial current of air might be injurious by the coldness it might occasion in crowded bedrooms where children are close shut up for eight or nine hours every night not only the pale bloated complexion which is seen in children of crowded manufactories but other diseases are produced by the impurity of the air page   0  such as indigestion difficulty of breath∣ing and sometimes convulsive fits as mentioned in zoonomia vol ii class iii     and lastly putrid fevers of which fatal instances frequently occur in the crowded habitations of the poor hence parents cannot be too careful in inspecting the bedrooms and the beds of the schools to which they entrust their children as not only their present comfort but their future health and sometimes their lives depend on this attention as is further explained in the section on rheumatism besides the due ventilation of rooms by a perpetual supply of pure air in sum∣mer something should be here said about the manner of warming them in winter as the quantity of air carried up a chim∣ney is very great owing to its being ren∣dered so much lighter than the external atmosphere by the heat of the fire strong currents of cold air press into the room at every chink of the doors and windows page   0  passing towards the fire and are liable to give catarrh rheumatism kibed heels and swelled fingers to those scholars who are exposed to them to lessen these cur∣rents of cold air setting in at every aper∣ture the chimney should be so contracted over the firegrate as to admit no more of the warm air to go up it than is necessary to carry up the smoke and hence much more of the warm air near the fireplace will rise up to the cieling and descend∣ing as it becomes cooler in the distant parts of the room will form a kind of ver∣tical eddy and warm the whole apart∣ment adding greatly to the heat produ∣ced by the radiation from the fire to effect this doctor franklin recom∣mended an iron or tin plate to slide under the mantlepiece over the fire so as to con∣tract the aperture of the chimney to two or three inches in width all the length over the firegrate and lately count rumford has accomplished the same purpose by a page   0  flat stone about twelve inches broad and eighteen inches high which is reared up∣on one end at the back of the fireplace a∣bout eight inches above the grate and leans forward towards the mantlepiece so as to leave an aperture three or four inches wide and twelve or fourteen inches long over the front of the fireplace the use of both these contrivances is to contract the mouth of the chimney and thus to ad∣mit no more warm air up it than is neces∣sary to convey the smoke and the slid∣ing iron plate in franklins plan and the endreared stone in rumfords plan are designed to be occasionally withdrawn for the admittance of the chimneysweeper these are described in detail in the essays of doctor franklin and count rumford and it is believed that onethird of the fuel may be thus saved and the rooms be kept more equally warm and more salu∣tary page  unnumbered section xxvii care of the shape delicate young ladies are very liable to become awry at many board∣ing schools this is occasioned principal∣ly by their being obliged too long to pre∣serve an erect attitude by sitting on forms for many hours together to prevent this the schoolseats should ei∣ther have backs on which they may oc∣casionally rest themselves or desks be∣fore them on which they may occasion∣ally lean this is a thing of greater con∣sequence than may appear to those who have not attended to it and who wish their children to acquire a very erect attitude page   0  when the least tendency to become awry is observed they should be advis∣ed to lie down on a bed or sofa for an hour in the middle of the day for many months which generally prevents the increase of this deformity by taking off for a time the pressure of the head and neck and shoulders on the spine of the back and it at the same time tends to make them grow taller young persons when nicely measur∣ed are found to be half an inch higher in the morning than at night as is well known to those who inlist very young men for soldiers this is owing to the cartilages between the bones of the back becoming compressed by the weight of the head and shoulders on them during the day it is the same pressure which produces curvitures and distortions of the spine in growing children where the bones are softer than usual and which may thus be relieved by an hori∣zontal page    0 posture for an hour in the middle of the day or by being frequently allow∣ed to lean on a chair or to play on a carpet on the ground young ladies should also be directed where two sleep in a bed to change every night or every week their sides of the bed which will prevent their tendency to sleep always on the same side which is not only liable to produce crook∣edness but also to occasion diseases by the internal parts being so long kept in uniform contact as to grow together for the same reason they should not be allowed to sit always on the same side of the fire or window because they will then be inclined too frequently to bend towards one side which in those consti∣tutions where the bones are too soft is liable to produce crookedness of the spine page      another great cause of injury to the shape of young ladies is from the pres∣sure of stays or other tight bandages which at the same time cause other dis∣eases by changing the form or situation of the internal parts if a hard part of the stays even a knot of the thread with which they are sewed together is press∣ed upon one side more than the other the child bends from the side which is uneasy and thus occasions a curviture of the spine to counteract this effect such stays as have fewest hard parts and especially such as can be daily or week∣ly turned are preferable to others a wise fashion of wearing no stiff stays which adds so much to the beauty of young ladies has commenced since the above was written and long may it continue where frequently lying down on a sofa in the day time and swinging fre∣quently page      for a small time by the head with loose dress do not relieve a beginning dis∣tortion of the back i have used with some success a swing for children to sleep in as described in zoonomia vol ii class i      and also a crutchchair as there delineated and where these do not seem to succeed recourse may also be had to mons vachers spinal machine first described in the memoirs of the academy of surgery in paris vol iii with a good print of it and since made by mr jones in london at no   northstreet tottenhamcourt road which suspends the head and places the weight of it on the hips it will be from hence easily perceived that all other methods of confining or di∣recting the growth of young people should be used with great skill such as back∣boards or bandages and that their appli∣cation should not be continued too long at a time least worse consequences should ensue than the deformity they are design∣ed page      to remove of these the stocks for the feet of children for the purpose of making them turn their toes quite out and the frame for pressing in their knees as they stand erect at the same time i suspect when carried to excess to be particularly injurious and to have caused an irrecover∣able lameness of hipjoint as explained in zoonomia vol ii class i      these therefore should be used with pro∣per caution so as to give no pain or un∣easy feels or not used at all to this it may be proper to add that the stiff erect attitude taught by some mo∣dern dancing masters does not contribute to the grace of person but rather militates against it as is well seen in one of the prints in hogarths analysis of beauty and is exemplified by the easy grace of some of the ancient statues as of the venus de medici and the antinous and in the works of some modern artists as in a beau∣tiful print of hebe feeding an eagle page      painted by hamilton and engraved by eginton and many of the figures of an∣gelica kauffman and lastly which is so eminently seen in many of the beauties of the present day since they have left off the constraint of whalebone stays and as∣sumed the graceful dress of the ancient grecian statues in the tendency to curviture of the spine whatever strengthens the general constitution is of service as the use of the cold bath in the summer months this however requires some restriction both in respect to the degree of coldness of the bath the time of continuing in it and the season of the year common springs which are of    degrees of heat are too cold for tender constitutions whether of children or adults and frequently do them great and irreparable injury as i have witnessed in three or four cases the coldness of river water in the summer page      months which is about    degrees or that of matlock which is about    or of bux∣ton which is    are much to be prefer∣red the two latter are improperly called warm baths comparing their degree of heat with that of common springs where∣as they are in reality cold baths being of much lower degree of heat than that of the human body which is    the time of continuing in a cold bath should be but a few minutes certainly not so long as to occasion a trembling of the limbs from cold in respect to the season of the year delicate children should certainly only use cold bathings in the summer months as the going frequently into the cold air in winter will answer all the purposes of the cold bath other means of counteracting the de∣bility of the system or softness of bones which occasion crookedness consist in tak∣ing internally from  0 to  0 grains of ex∣tract of bark with as much soda phospho∣rata page      and mixed with from five to ten drops of tincture of opium twice a day for three or four weeks as is further treated of in zoonomia vol ii class i      and    page  unnumbered section xxviii dress young ladies should be instruct∣ed to shew attention to their dress as it gives an idea of cleanliness of their per∣sons which has so great a charm that it may be reckoned amongst the inferior vir∣tues for this purpose an elegant simplici∣ty of dress is to be recommended in pre∣ference to that superabundance of orna∣ment where the lady herself is the least part of her the form of dress must ne∣vertheless perpetually vary with the fashion of the time but a person of taste may lessen those parts of a fashionable dress which oppose beauty or grace and bring forwards those which are more coincident with them so as to wear a dress in fashion and yet not devoid of taste page      thus when large hoops were in gene∣ral use which so totally militate with all ideas of beauty and grace ladies of taste wore them as small as custom would al∣low so in respect to the earrings of the present day since piercing the tender part of the ear for the purpose of suspend∣ing a weight of gold or of precious stones or of glass beads to it reminds us of the savage state of mankind those ladies of taste who think themselves obliged to com∣ply with this indecorous fashion use the lightest materials as a chain of small pearls to give a less distressing idea of the pain they seem to suffer at every motion of their heads hence also long pendant and complicated earrings however they may add to the dignity of riper years by their costliness are unbecoming to young ladies as they seem to give pain in the quicker tho more graceful motions of juvenility sir joshua reynolds i think observes in one of his addresses to the academy page      that hard curls of hair stiffened with the fat of hogs and covered with the flower of wheat cannot be admitted into picture the same may be observed of that coat of mail the whalebone stays the use of which is now so happily discontinued both of these however they may conceal the grey hairs and waining figures of those who are advanced in life are highly inju∣rious to the flowing locks and graceful forms of young ladies as beauty consists of lines flowing in easy curves according to the analysis of hogarth those parts of dress which are composed of such lines are always agreea∣ble thus a sash descending from one shoulder to the opposite hip or a grecian veil thrown back and winding carelessly down behind are always beautiful but a few white ostrich feathers rising on the head before and a train of silk sweeping on the ground behind add so much grace to a moving female figure as to attract all eyes with unceasing admiration page    0 in moving forwards the hair falls back and in very swift motion floats upon the air behind hence by association of ideas when the hair is made to retire from the cheeks it gives an intimation of the youth∣ful agility of the person and when it is brought forwards over the cheeks it may consent with unmoving dignity like the full wig of a judge but diminishes our idea of the activity of playful youth where the appearance of use in dress can be given to ornaments it suggests an excuse for wearing them and is therefore to be preferred as diamond pins strings of pearl and a comb of shell to restrain the exuberant hair or knots of ribbons to fix the slipper on the foot to contract the sleeve around the arm to unite the vest up∣on the bosom or to attach the cap above the forehead and when these are similar in colour it gives an air of simplicity and a kind of pyramidal form to the dress which the painters so much endeavour to page      exhibit both in their landscapes and their groups of figures other ornaments which bear no analo∣gy to use in dress should be sparingly worn lest they give an idea that they were designed to display the pride of the possessor rather than to decorate her per∣son these are sometimes seen so ill placed as to make deformities conspicuous as a number of rings on singers distorted with the gout or splendid buckles on turn∣edin feet where there is no appear∣ance of use all shining ornaments should be so disposed as to direct the eye of the be∣holder to some beautiful feature of the la∣dy who wears them as diamond stars in the hair and artificial flowers on the bosom paint and perfumes are totally inadmis∣sible in the dress of young ladies as they give a suspicion of natural defects in res∣pect to colour of the skin and odour page      of the breath where there exists but a mediocrity of beauty and youth is in the wain a variety of pretty or of costly ornaments on the dress and even the whiteness of powder in the hair may sometimes mingle with our idea of the per∣son and seem to render the whole fairer more pleasing or more respectable but ornaments of every kind are useless or in∣jurious to youthful beauty they add no power to the charm but rather disenchant the beholder by abstracting his attention which dwells with undiminished rapture on beauty arrayed by simplicity and ani∣mated without affectation thus the ma∣jestic juno of homer is arrayed in variety of ornament and with earrings which have three large pendant bobs to each and commands universal homage but his queen of beauty is dressed with more sim∣ple elegance in her magic sash or cestus and charms all eyes the attention to taste in dress may ne∣vertheless be carried into an extreme it page      should not seem to be the most important part of the education of a young lady or the principal object of her care she should rather appear to follow than to lead the fa∣shion according to the lines of mr pope be not the first on which the new are tried nor yet the last to lay the old aside page  unnumbered section xxix amusements are generally distinguished from exercise as they relieve or exhilerate the mind cards may be occasionally used by children in private families without their gaming for money and will in general fa∣cilitate their acquirement of arithmetic but cannot be allowed in schools lest the young ladies should expend too much time upon them or should play for money clan∣destinely but the game of chess from its bearing so great analogy to common life is supposed much to improve the most useful powers of the mind it has the experience of the remotest antiquity to recommend it occasions no depraved passions as it is not played for money and by the caution per∣petually necessary to watch your adversary page      and the judgment required to contrive ar∣range and manage your own affairs em∣ploys and strengthens every part of the understanding embroidery drawing music as well as the exercises of dancing swinging play∣ing at ball and shuttlecock should be classed amongst the amusements of young ladies and should be reciprocally ap∣plied to either in the house or in the open air for the purpose of relieving each other and of producing by such means an uninterrupted cheerfulness of mind which is the principal charm that fits us for so∣ciety and the great source of earthly hap∣piness page  unnumbered section xxx punishments rewards motives it is the custom of many schools to use some kinds of punishments which either give pain or disgrace to the delin∣quent as a fools cap or a meal of water gruel the use of these are seldom if ever necessary in schools for young ladies and are always attended with disagreeable consequences as they either diminish the character of honour in the punished per∣sons sink their spirits or render them in∣sensible to the opinions of others or in∣jure their health insomuch that at some schools all that can be acquired can scarce∣ly compensate the loss of cheerfulness and degradation of mind or bad health which their punishments produce page      thus the sitting in the public school for an hour in a cap with bells diminishes the sensibility of a child to the opinions of her companions and thus gradually de∣stroys one of the greatest motives to good actions and of the greatest restraints from bad ones for the same reason repri∣mands and even admonitions should be al∣ways applied in private but applause or re∣ward in public a meal of water gruel given as a pu∣nishment instead of a meal of animal food so frequently had recourse to in some boarding schools i believe to have laid the foundation of incurable debility the diseases of debility as scrophula bronch∣ocele softness of bones and the conse∣quent distortion of them are very com∣mon among the children of the poor in derby which on examination i believe to be owing to their food consisting chiefly of gruel or sometimes with milk which has been twice skimmed so that it is total∣ly page      deprived of its most nourishing part at other times with weak salt broth but sel∣dom with solid animal food when broth is weak in respect to the quantity of flesh∣meat boiled in it it is the custom of cooks to add much salt to it to increase the relish which renders it still more injurious to weak children as salt contains no nou∣rishment and by its stimulus increases the action of the system and by promoting great insensible or sensible perspiration di∣minishes the strength of the child more than the small quantity of meat dissolved in the broth can counterbalance   how then are refractory children to be governed certainly by the superi∣ority of the mind of the teacher over that of the pupil when a famous lady in italy was put to the torture and question∣ed by what sorcery she had governed a princess of the family of medici she an∣swered by no sorcery but by that power which superior minds possess over inferi∣or ones page        besides the two circumstances which so much govern the great world i mean hope of reward and fear of punish∣ment in the microscosm of a boarding school blame and praise if given very sparingly will be found strong motives to the little pupils to perform their tasks well and of more efficacy ten times than the meal of water gruel or the disgrace of a cap and bells esteem and disgrace are observed by mr locke to be of all others the most powerful incentives to the mind when once it is brought to regard them and if once you can communicate to chil∣dren a love of credit and an apprehension of shame you have instilled into them a principle which will constantly act and incline them to do right tho it is not the true source from whence our actions ought to spring which should be from our duty to others and to ourseives—see essay on education sect    c where are many other valuable observations on this subject page    0   emulation at seeing others excel if properly managed is another incitement to industry but as this is liable to de∣generate into envy it should rather be left to its own operation than be promoted by pointing out the examples which should be copied it is better to say your task is not done to day so well as you sometimes do it than to say your task is not done so well as your sisters since in the lat∣ter case envy and its consequence hatred may succeed a thing of tenfold worse consequence than the neglect of a thousand tasks   tho some degree of flattery may be used with success in teaching veracity to very young children as mentioned in sect    of this work yet i think it should be used very rarely indeed and only on very important occasions lest it should become a necessary motive of action instead of moral duty as observed in zoonomia vol ii class iii     the debi∣lity page      of the exertion of voluntary efforts prevents the accomplishment of all the great purposes of life this often origi∣nates from a mistaken education in which pleasure or vanity is made the immediate motive of action and not fu∣ture advantage or what is termed duty this observation is of great value to those who attend to the early education of their own children i have seen one or two young mar∣ried ladies of fortune who perpetually became uneasy and believed themselves ill a week after their arrival in the coun∣try and continued so uniformly during their stay yet on their return to lon∣don or to bath immediately lost all their complaints and this i observed to hap∣pen to them repeatedly all which i was led to ascribe to their being in their infancy surrounded with menial attend∣ants who had slattered them into the exertions which they then used and page      that in their mature years they became torpid for the want of this stimulus and could not amuse themselves by any vol∣untary employment but required ever after to be slattered into activity or to be amused by others   rewards have been given to children to excite their industry in the performance of particular tasks these are certainly less eligible motives to action than the fear of disgrace the love of re∣putation and above all the obligations of duty where nevertheless these are thought proper the kind of rewards re∣quires some attention which should consist of books or maps or boxes of colours or needle cases but not of mo∣ney or of trinkets for ornamental dress or of a glass of wine where money is given as a reward for industry in chil∣dren it may seem to them to be the pro∣per motive of their actions instead of re∣putation or of duty and may thus in∣duce page      the vice of avarice or of extrava∣gance where a fine cap or gown is given as a reward of diligence the pride of dress may be produced and become their great motive of action instead of the love of reputation or of duty and lastly where a glass of wine is given as a reward for industry a child is taught to believe wine to be a most valuable ac∣quisition and a perpetual desire of it even to intoxication may be the con∣sequence i remember a wealthy farm∣er who had two drunken sons tho he was a sober man himself who told me that he ascribed this great misfortune to his having occasionally given them in their early life a cup of ale as a reward for their exertious—see locke on edu∣cation sect    c   a very accurate observer who has long had the conduct of schools of various kinds for the instruction of the youth of both sexes acquaints me that page      he has often with extreme surprize ob∣served a child make a greater progress in some one branch of education in three months than another of similar age oppor∣tunity capacity and even apparently of equal application has been able to effect in three years the same observation has been made by others but he adds that this might probably arise from some trivial circumstance which deter∣mined the inclination of the fortunate stu∣dent and that it is possible that the means may sometime be discovered of governing these incidents and thus producing a new era in the art of education similar to this it has often been observ∣ed that the first impressions made on our infant minds by accidental disgust admi∣ration or flattery are the frequent causes of our antipathies or aversions and con∣tinue through life to bias our affections or mislead our judgments one of my ac∣quaintance can trace the origin of many of his own energies of action from some page      such remote sources which justifies the observation of m rousseau that the seeds of future virtues or vices are oftener sown by the mother than by the tutor page  unnumbered section xxxi lisping lisping is a defect of pronuncia∣tion occasioned by childrens making use of the sound of the letter th sibilant in∣stead of the letter s as instead of is it so they say ith it tho to break this habit they must be taught to pronounce the s by putting the point of the tongue against the roots of the upper teeth and not to put it between their teeth as in pro∣nouncing the th this is easily accom∣plished by putting their own finger against the point of the tongue as it comes be∣tween their teeth in attempting to pro∣nounce the letter s and pushing it back into the mouth i once saw a young lady who after she had left school had the habit of using oc∣casionally page      tho not constantly the gutteral ch instead of the letter s which was un∣commonly disagreeable to english ears she corrected this ill habit by being taught as above how to place the tongue in pro∣nouncing the s but not without many trials and much attention for some weeks as great efforts and pertinacious industry are required to break any habit which has been long esiablished many children from the difficulty of speaking it are liable to a defective pronun∣ciation of the letter r this in indeed al∣most general in some parts of northumber∣land and is said to be a sound unknown in china which obliged the catholic mis∣sionaries sent thither by louis the   th to change the name of the virgin mary from maria into malia or from mary into mal∣ly in speaking the letter r the middle of the tongue is made to vibrate with semivo∣cal air whereas in pronouncing l the edges of the tongue only vibrate the page      northumberland vernacular r is formed with sibilant air instead of semivocal air or differs from the true r as s differs from z both which should be explained to those children who have this imperfect pronunciation among the lower orders of the people of london who are called cockneys the letter w is pronounced sibilant like the german w and not semivocal like our vernacular one this seems to resemble the sound of v to inattentive ears and these cockneys are thence supposed to use v instead of w as vomen and vine instead of women and wine this defect is rea∣dily conquered by teaching such children to give more vocal sound to their w by sounding it at first like oo page  unnumbered section xxxii stammering this impediment of speech has ge∣nerally for its remote cause a too great dif∣fidence or bashfulness joined with an am∣bition of shining in conversation and for its immediate cause an interruption of the asso∣ciation of the initial letter of a word with the remainder of it which association is dis∣severed by the illintroduced sensation of awe bashfulness desire of shining or fear of not succeeding and then violent vo∣luntary efforts are in vain employed to re∣join the broken association and give rise to various distortions of countenance as explained in zoonomia vol ii class iv     that this impediment of pronuncia∣tion is altogether a disease of the mind and page    0 not of the organs of speech is shewn by the stammerer being able to speak all words with perfect facility when alone as in re∣peating a play but begins to hesitate if any one approaches or even if he ima∣gines that he is listened to those words also are most difficult to him to pronounce which he is conscious he cannot change for others as when he is asked his own name or the names of other persons or of places and the more so if he is aware that the hearer is impatient to be inform∣ed and that he cannot conjecture the name before it is spoken it requires great attention and much time to overcome this bad habit they should be daily exercised in speaking sin∣gle words as in spelling and when they hesitate or find difficulty in announcing the beginning of a word they should re∣peat it frequently aloud without the initial letter and at length repeat it with the ini∣tial letter in a soster tone page      suppose the stammerer finds difficulty in speaking the word paper and says p p p p repeatedly but cannot join the a after it he must be taught to pronounce aper aper aper without the initial p for many successive times and this aper should be spoken aloud with more breath than common as if an h preceded it and at length he should add in a softer tone the letter p to it this together with an hourly atten∣tion to speaking and reading slowly and practising in this manner every word which is not readily spoken both in pri∣vate and in company i am informed is the principle on which those masters cure this impediment who make it a profession and to this should be added a frequent in∣troduction to the society of strangers in order to acquire less agitation or anxiety about the opinions of others page  unnumbered section xxxiii squinting this defect of vision which is term∣ed strabismns may frequently be con∣quered in children if it be attended to early before it has been long established by habit in this deformity it generally happens that one eye is better than the other which induces the child to view ob∣jects with the best eye and to hide the center of the nose this greater irritabi∣lity of one eye is often occasioned i sus∣pect in infancy by tying a bandage for too long a time over an eye which has happened to be slightly inflamed and thus decreasing its power of action by di∣suse in the same manner the large muscles of the body become weakened by long in∣action and the right arm is generally page      stronger than the left from its having been more frequently exercised in this case if the best eye be for an hour or two or longer covered every day with gauze stretched upon a circular piece of whalebone so as to render the vision of this eye as indistinct as that of the other the child will naturally turn them both to the same object and in a little time the weak eye will become stronger by being used or the strong one weaker by disuse and the child will cease to squint another kind of squinting is owing in∣tirely to a bad habit and consists in look∣ing at objects with one eye only at a time the owl bends both his eyes upon the ob∣ject which he observes and by thus perpe∣tually turning his head to the thing he in∣spects appears to have greater attention to it and has thence acquired the name of the bird of wisdom all other birds i believe look at objects with one eye only but it is page      with the eye nearest the object attended to whereas in this kind of strabismns the per∣son attends to objects with the most distant eye only this habit has probably been produced by a cap worn in infancy which projected forward beyond the head on each side like the bluffs of a coachhorse so as to make it easier for the child as he lay in his cradle to view oblique objects with the eye most distant from them which kind of cap is therefore to be avoided a curious case of this ill habit of vision is related in the philos transact vol    by dr darwin which was relieved by fix∣ing a parchment gnomon on the nose of the little boy which projected about an inch from the ridge of it and caused him for a time to view oblique objects with that eye which was nearest them page  unnumbered section xxxiv involuntary motions by confinement in a schoolroom for many successive hours and that with∣out being suffered to vary their posture some of the more active and lively chil∣dren are liable to gain tricks of involun∣tary actions as twitchings of the face restless gesticulations of the limbs biting their nails c which are generally at first occasioned by the want of sufficient bodily exercise to expend the superfluous animal power like the jumping of a squirrel in a cage but are also liable to be caught by imitation of each other to prevent this kind of deformity children should be suffered to change their attitudes and situations more fre∣quently page      or to walk about as they get their lessons to counteract it the ear∣liest attention is necessary as a few weeks frequently establish a bad habit which cannot be removed without great diffi∣culty this however may be effected early in the disease by a bandage nicely applied on the moving muscles or by adhesive plasters put tightly over them or by an issue placed over them so as to give a little pain when the muscles are thrown into action under it page  unnumbered section xxxv swelled fingers and kibed heels are inflammations liable to affect tender children in many schools during the winter months the latter of these complaints is generally ow∣ing to the coldness of a brick or plaster floor to their feet or to their sitting in un∣changed shoes and stockings after walk∣ing in the wet and the former to their being kept too long from the fire in the cold parts of the schoolroom without gloves nothing prevents or cures these mala∣dies but a due attention to keep the ex∣tremities of delicate children warm either by clothing exercise or fire the in∣flammation of the heels or toes may be page      sometimes removed by covering them with a double linen rag moistened in a satur∣nine solution made by dissolving half an ounce of sugar of lead in half a pint of water to be renewed morning and night as the swelling of the fingers thus pro∣duced is liable to continue and to injure the shape of them it becomes of greater importance but may in some measure be afterwards diminished or removed by the frequent application of vitriolic ether to them the skin of the lips and of the hands and arms of children is liable to become inflamed and chopped or rough in frosty weather owing both to the coldness and dryness of the air the former is re∣lieved by the application of a lipsalve made by mixing minium or red lead with spermaceti and oil to a proper consistance or by blue mercurial ointment the lat∣ter by wearing leathern gloves the inside of which is smeared with spermaceti soft∣ened page      with a little oil or with pomatum gloves thus prepared prevent too great ex∣halation from the skin in frosty air and the consequent too great dryness and rough∣ness of it page  unnumbered section xxxvi beds the rheumatism and other inflam∣matory diseases are frequently occa∣sioned in crowded schools by placing some of the beds with one side against a wall where the weaker child confined by a stronger bedfellow is liable to lie for hours together with some part of it in contact with the cold wall which in the winter months has often been at∣tended with fatal consequences and especially in those boarding schools where the beds are small and but one blanket allowed to each of them and a scanty featherbed we are indued with a very accurate sense to distinguish heat and cold which page      should be nicely attended to as the ex∣tremes of both of them are injurious to health and more so in our sleeping than in our waking hours the extreme of heat is not much experienced in this climate except when it is artificially produced but that of cold is the cause of numerous diseases of the most fatal tendency a severe continued frost may may be borne by the strong who can keep themselves warm by their activity but is destructive to the weak and seden∣tary in the year      the weather in january and in one week of february was uncommonly severe the same five weeks in january and february      were uncommonly mild and it appears by the bills of mortality in london that      people died in these five weeks of frost in      and that only      died in the same five weeks of mild weather in      which is not much more than half the number—see a paper by dr heberden in philos transact for the year      page      some misinformed parents have con∣ceived that a hard bed contributes to harden their children in respect to their bearing cold and have on that account laid them on strawmattresses or on beds with boarded bottoms the only dif∣ference between lying on a soft or hard bed consists in this the weight of the body in the former case presses on a larger surface and in the latter on a less neither of which has any reference to the habits of tenderness or hardiness in respect to cold and heat unless indeed a featherbed is so soft that as the child sinks down in the middle of it the rising edges bend over him and in part cover him perhaps beds made of soft leather properly prepared and inflated with air as the emperor of germany was said to use in camp might be preferable on this account to featherbeds the beds for young children cannot therefore be too soft however they may page      contribute to the indolence of grown people provided they do not keep them too warm by bending over them as a∣bove described but the too great hard∣ness of beds is i believe frequently inju∣rious to the shape of infants by occasion∣ing them to rest on too few parts at a time which hardens those parts by pres∣sure and prevents their proportionate growth it also occasions their sleep to be less sound by the uneasiness it causes and in consequence less refreshing the feet and knees and hands of weaker children are liable to become cold in bed in winter on which account it is more salutary for them to sleep with a bedfellow rather than alone as they then naturally put their cold knees or hands to their companion in bed and thus frequently prevent rheu∣matic and other inflammatory diseases of fatal event for the same reason it is better for a new born infant to sleep page      with its mother in winter or with a young nurse than in a solitary crib by her bedside unless the artificial warmth of the room be more nicely graduated than is commonly done for the same reason where children are too feeble from illness a fire should be allowed in their bedchamber in cold weather as the cold air is otherwise injurious to their lungs which cannot be clothed so as to prevent the contact of of the air like the other parts of the bo∣dy a fire contributes also to ventilate a room and to circulate the air in it and thence to render it more salutary but it should not warm it to more than  0 or    degrees that its temperature may not differ too much from that of the external atmosphere as those who are kept generally too warm are liable to take cold at every blast of air not from 〈◊〉 degree of cold to which they hap∣pen page      to be exposed but to its difference from that which they have been ac∣customed to—see sect xxvi the universal analogy derived from other animals which produce a feeble offspring evinces the truth of this doc∣trine both in respect to the softness and the due degree of warmth of their beds birds line the nests for their young with feathers the eider duck and the rabbit pluck the down from their own breasts to increase the softness of the beds for their tender offspring and brood them with their wings or clasp them to their bosoms for the sake of warmth the number of hours required for salutary sleep is greater for younger chil∣dren than for those more advanced as during our progress through life we ac∣quire greater facility in using our volun∣tary power and recruit it in less time when exhausted the younger classes page      of scholars may go to rest at seven or eight but the elder should be allowed another hour for the purposes of reading or other kinds of improvement the hour of rising must vary with the season page  unnumbered section xxxvii diet milk is the food designed by na∣ture for young animals and should be gi∣ven them in its recent state as the cream is the most nourishing part of the milk and is easier of digestion than the coagulable or cheesy part and as milk constitutes a principal portion of the ali∣ment of children to take off the cream once or even twice as is practised in some boarding schools before it is given to the children is a shameful circumstance of parsimony and very injurious to their healths—see sect xxx on punishments nor should the milk given to children be long kept in a boiling heat because much of its fragrant oil is then evaporated page      as is evident from the fine odour of the steam of it when taken from the fire and its further deterioration from long boiling is shewn by its then inducing constipation which is contrary to its effect in its recent and natural state nevertheless even new milk does not always agree with children after they have passed the years of infancy for milk ta∣ken into the stomach must be always pre∣viously curdled or coagulated before it can be digested or converted into nou∣rishment hence milk is always found curdled in the stomachs of calves and the acid juice of their stomachs is used to co∣agulate their milk in the process of cheese∣making now the stomachs of young chil∣dren abound more with this acid juice than in their riper years and when a sufficient quantity of it is not produced for the pur∣pose of curdling the milk which they drink it is liable to disagree page      to these few therefore whose sto∣machs do not easily digest the coagulable part of milk other fluid sood should be al∣lowed to breakfast as gruel or tea with cream and sugar in it and with bread and butter and to supper a slice of cold meat or of cheese or tart or bread and butter with small beer or water for drink but it is probable that milk might be made to agree with all stomachs if it was previous∣ly curdled by rennet as i have often re∣commended with success to elderly per∣sons or by letting it stand till it becomes spontaneously sour like buttermilk as is the custom of the inferior people of scot∣land except nevertheless where the dis∣taste of the child is owing to prejudice or caprice which is then incurable but by time for dinner animal food plain dressed with vegetables or bread and pudding of wheat flour milk and eggs with sugar or butter are more nourishing than vegetable page    0 sustenance alone wheat flour contains more nutriment than that of rice or bar∣ley or oats as it possesses more starch in proportion to its bulk and a gluten ap∣proaching to animal matter but much salt or spice should not be allowed in the diet of children as they are certainly un∣wholesome by inducing a weakness of the capillary and absorbent systems of vessels in consequence of their too great stimulus and contain no nourishment as butter and sugar are perhaps the most nutritive of animal and vegetable substances they may be more easily taken to excess on which account some mistaken parents have totally prohibited the use of them which is a great disadvantage to weaker children who require more nutri∣tive diet in less bulk than stronger ones for the drink of the more robust chil∣dren water is preferable and for the weak∣er ones small beer but in this as well as page      in the choice of solid food their palates should be consulted for the nice discern∣ment of this sense is bestowed on us by na∣ture to distinguish what the stomach can best digest it should however be observ∣ed that in artificial viands the taste cannot distinguish what is unwholesome as sugar may be mixed with arsenic so in the drinking of fermented liquors as ale or wine which are chemical productions the palate is not to be consulted a glass of mere wine should never be given to chil∣dren as it injures their tender stomachs like a glass of brandy or rum or gin to a grown person and induces those diseases which it is often erroneously given to pre∣vent as weakness of digestion with the production of worms in consequence wine nevertheless diluted with thrice its quantity of water may be allowed if re∣quired instead of small beer or ale or cider diluted with thrice their quantities of water page      ripe fruits or fruit pies are peculiar∣ly serviceable to the constitutions of chil∣dren as well as agreeable to their palates as they are known to prevent biliary con∣cretions and consequent jaundice and on the same account to render the skin clear∣er and fairer as well as to counteract the tendency to putrid diseases these should therefore be allowed to children at all sea∣sons and may either occasionally consti∣tute a part of their diet or may be recom∣mended to them when they lay out part of their pocketmoney with hucksters in preference to seedcakes gingerbread or sugarplumbs the former of which are generally made of bad flour deteriorated by spice and the latter are liable to be co∣loured with gamboge vermillion verdi∣grease or other noxious drugs too long fasting or food of less nou∣rishment than they have been accustomed to are peculiarly injurious to children as they weaken their power of digestion im∣pair page      their strength and impede their growth the children of the inferior poor and of families which have adopted some illadvised rules of abstemious diet are frequently starved into the scrophula and become palefaced and bloated owing to deficiency of the quantity of blood and to want of sufficient stimulus to the absorb∣ent system if young people are thought to be too corpulent a diminution of food with an increase of exercise when they have ob∣tained their full growth may be used with advantage but even then not without cau∣tion since young ladies after they have left school who by ill advice use too great abstinence are liable to become pale and emaciated and to fall into universal debi∣lity which remains through a diseased and comfortless life page  unnumbered section xxxviii economy   a due regard to the prudent ex∣penditure of their money a proper care of their clothes and a parsimonious atten∣tion to the lapse of time should be incul∣cated into the minds of young ladies to effect these purposes one efficacious me∣thod where the usual exhortations fail may be to suffer their imprudence to pro∣duce some inconvenience to themselves which they should be permitted to feel to a proper degree thus a profuse unnecessary expendi∣ture of their pocket money will shortly in∣duce poverty which should by no means be alleviated by a fresh supply of money till the inconvenience produced has effect∣ed page      a conviction of the impropriety of their conduct except when the expenditure has been made for some laudable purpose and then no time should be lost in restor∣ing the power of repeating it the same mean may be used in res∣pect to their omission to take care of their clothes they should find the necessity of repairing them with their own hands or of foregoing some visiting amusements till new ones can be procured that thus the consequent inconvenience may teach them economy if they are otherwise too inat∣tentive to the usual admonitions on these subjects in respect to the economy of time the hours of amusement and of exercise should be regularly counted and the length of time young ladies employ in dressing should be nicely attended to as in adult life the hours consumed at the toilet of some ladies is perfectly ridiculous and de∣tains page      them from more important duties perhaps a stated time might be allowed the young ladies for adjusting the articles of their dress that they might acquire a habit of disposing them with neatness taste and elegance and yet with expedition   men are generally trained from their early years to the business or profes∣sion in which they are afterwards to en∣gage but it most frequently happens to ladies that tho destined to the superin∣tendance of a future family they receive scarcely any previous instruction but be∣gin this important office with a profound ignorance of the value of money and of the proper application of the things which surround them many young ladies destitute of mo∣thers and without a home are continued at school to a later age such should be formed into a class and properly instruct∣ed in domestic economy each of them page      superintending the business of the family a week or a month by turns not only pro∣viding for the table and directing the cookery but they should also be taught other parts of domestic employment as cutting out linens and making them up with plain and strong needle work either for their own families or to be given as clothing for necessitous infants or mothers such an addition of domestic know∣ledge and benevolent industry to orna∣mental accomplishments would give the school that procures it a decided advan∣tage over other schools which have no such institution page  unnumbered section xxxix schooleducation the advantages of a schooleduca∣tion where twenty or thirty children are properly instructed over that in a private family are derived from several sources first it must be observed that almost all our exertions in early life are owing to our imitating others in child∣hood we are most liable to imitate the actions of those who are somewhat old∣er than ourselves and in manhood of those who are in somewhat higher life whence the general prevalence of fa∣shion in dress and manners now there are more examples to cause imitative activity in well conducted schools and the children in consequence become more active in the pursuit of their stu∣dies page      and in the acquirement of their ac∣complishments it may be added that not only chil∣dren before they have acquired the use of reason or voluntary deliberation but that the greatest part of adult mankind learn all the common arts of life by imi∣tating others and that even dumb creatures seem capable of acquiring knowledge with greater facility by imi∣tating each other than by any methods by which we can teach them thus dogs when they are sick learn of each other to eat grass as an emetic and cats to moisten their paws for the purpose of washing their faces and the readiest way to instruct all brute animals is by practising them with others of the same species which have already learnt the arts we wish them to acquire as ex∣plained in zoonomia vol i sect     page    0 a second advantage of schools when well conducted is that children often take pleasure in teaching each other in∣somuch that at boys schools i have of∣ten observed that the lower classes have learnt more from their schoolfellows of the higher classes than even from their masters which has sometimes arisen from the friendship or vanity of the el∣der boy and sometimes from the solicita∣tion of the lower one but has in all cases been advantageous to both of them a third superiority of school educa∣tion arises from an emulation which na∣turally exists where many pursue the same studies but which should not be encouraged by rewards or degradations as it then may degenerate into envy or hatred but should in general be left in∣tirely to its own operation as mention∣ed in sect xxx a fourth advantage of schooleduca∣tion is from the children acquiring a page      kind of practical physiognomy which renders them more intelligent and more interesting companions and is of great∣er consequence in our passage through life than almost any single accomplish∣ment as explained in sect vi and sect xxiv of this work fifthly where languages are learnt by conversation as is generally practised in teaching the french language a schooleducation properly conducted is much superior to that of a governess in a private family and languages are so much easier taught to children by con∣versation than by the abstract rules of grammar that mr locke is solicitous to have the latin and greek languages taught by conversation in boys schools and thinks the time of learning words might thus be much shortened which now occu∣pies seven or eight years part of which might be much better employed in acquir∣ing the knowledge of things page      the philosopher who despising the goods of fortune said he was rich though he carried about with him every thing which he possessed meant to assert that strength of mind joined with strength of body were superior to any other advan∣tages of life a good education furnishes us with this inestimable treasure it ac∣companies us at home travels with us a∣broad delights us in solitude graces us in society comforts us in misfortune guards us in prosperity contributes to the happiness of others and ensures our own page  unnumbered section xl catalogue of books i beg leave to apprize the reader that i have inserted a great part of the fol∣lowing catalogue of books for the younger children because they were recommend∣ed to me by ladies whose opinions i had reason to regard and not from my own at∣tentive perusal of them which has been prevented by my other necessary occupa∣tions such of them therefore as are less generally known a parent or governess will please to read before they put them in∣to the hands of their children and i can only add that if i had myself been better acquainted with them the collection would probably have been less numerous  • page  unnumbered

shines in that little incident recorded to her im∣mortal honour a lady of ionia coming one day to visit her impatiently expected to be shewn the splendor and magnificence of her toilette which she supposed from her rank and fortune to be very superb the illustrious roman prolonged the con∣versation till her children were at hand and then introducing them to her visitor—these says she are my jewels page   00 the writer of these letters has so great a veneration for the domestic character of this lady that she thinks she cannot do better than give them to the public under the signature of cornelia and whatever their other defects may be they have this at least to recommend them that the same sentiments of maternal tenderness which influenced the roman matron gave rise to these epistles and prompted a fond mo∣ther to become an author page  unnumbered rudiments of taste letter i a desire of happiness is the first propensity of the heart—it is born with us and to attempt its suppression were e∣qually fruitless and wrong for the author of nature has done nothing in vain and the happiness he has imprinted on the mind so clear an idea of has somewhere an existence hitherto you have obeyed the impulse of nature in the artless pursuits of child∣hood but the time is at hand when this sweet tranquillity will be interrupted by the bustle of the world which will not longer permit you to repose in the simple amusements of dressing dolls pursuing butterflies or plucking daisies sweet page   0  dear delights of innocence on which as you climb the rugged heights of life you will look back with fond regret but we are not born for ourselves a∣lone and therefore have duties to per∣form obligations to discharge and diffi∣culties to encounter in the course of which many a severe check is given to this happiness which we all so ardently seek yet the desire of it will even acquire strength by the repulse and there was ne∣ver yet a wretch who had found it dimi∣nished by misfortune i wish the success of this passion could be shewn as demon∣strable as its existence but the truth is all mankind are run∣ning after the same object though in such opposite directions that if it were not for their concurrent testimony it would be scarcely credible that they had each the same view yet it is the fate of most of them to sit down at last in the very same page   0  disposition which solomon was in when he complained rather peevishly it must be owned that all was vanity and vexation of spirit man walks indeed in a vain sha∣dow and tis pitiable to reflect that a being of so transient a duration should yet waste the trifling portion of time allotted him in vain and fruitless pursuits and after all the schemes of the sanguine and the la∣bours of the active to find the desired at∣tainment as far off as ever but this has been the case of millions and i am afraid will continue to be so at least till we are unanimous in deciding on that grand point wherein this good of which we have all so high an idea con∣sists an agreement from which alas we are at the farthest distance imaginable and here my dearest girls lies the whole of the mistake the creator has not been wanting to provide a happiness exalted as the mind itself can conceive but man himself errs in the pursuit of it some page   0  placing it in riches some in power scarce∣ly one in an age supposing it to be where it really is—in the practice of virtue but while the human heart is set on acquirements in which it can find no sa∣tisfaction if attained the span of life must necessarily be passed in restless anxieties and melancholy disappointment it was the aim of philosophy to draw just esti∣mates of things and to prevent its pupils from being dazzled with the splendor of wealth and power it taught that the so∣vereign good was to be found in rectitude of will it would be a shame for us to be at a loss on such an important subject who have received lessons from a much better

under this head must be comprehend∣ed the various species of fashionable amuse∣ments which are injurious either to health or fortune one would scarcely suppose such pursuits as these should ever be dig∣nified with the name of pleasure yet when numbers are daily seen hazarding not only extravagant sums but peace of mind also at the gamingtable—when the order of nature is inverted and the re∣freshments of repose are bartered for mid∣night routs we must conclude that such valuable sacrifices are not made but with the expectation of some supreme pleasure to reward them how seldom such rewards are found can best be determined by the testimony of the dissipated and gay who after they have wasted the most valuable page   0  blessings of life as time health spirits c will generally

but it is a piece of wisdom you my dear girls must also acquire if you expect to be happy fashion has ar∣rogated to itself the prerogative of fixing the criterion of pleasure but fashion is often a dangerous director and is at best an imperfect one for who has a power of effectually biassing the natural disposition of another if therefore what is called amusement be not agreeable to the real turn of the mind it ceases to be viewed in that light and can only be considered as an irksome conformity to the tastes of others yet abject as such a submission un∣doubtedly is there are thousands who vo∣luntarily page   0  yield to it who are content to live move and act not as they like them∣selves but as the polite world thinks fit to dictate i am no advocate for affected sin∣gularity in

imagination can paint them but if so vast a multitude have erred in the pursuit of pleasure through levity not an inconsiderable number of a very oppo∣site temper are at equally as great a dis∣tance from it these are the morose and cynical who will not condescend to the sober satisfactions that are to be found in a domestic circle where the social affections are cultivated if the gay and volatile mis∣take the nature of pleasure these seem to page      question its very existence and pass thro life without stooping to pick up even one of the fair blossoms which nature has scat∣tered in the way ever be your hearts open to the sweet emotions of social love and you will not have cause to complain that the path of human life affords nothing but briars and thorns nor is it from the relative duties alone we can derive happiness the amusing the interesting book of nature is open to all who can read it here you meet with eternal variety order and beauty a thou∣sand charms await the mind which possesses a taste for simple pleasures to such the whole creation is a boundless source of rational amusements happy ineffably happy they who can be pleased with art∣less nature and contemplate with delight the noble imagery with which she abounds for my part i should desire no greater page      proof of the purity and elegance of your taste than to hear you speak in raptures of the graceful foliage of a wood the beauty of a lawn or any of those charming rural scenes which are so often overlooked for the far less nobler productions of art esteem me ever the most affectionate of your friends page  unnumbered letter iii every one knows that human life is exposed to various miseries but every one does not know at least does not con∣sider that the far greater part of these mi∣series spring from the passions yet the passions you reply are implanted in us by nature—we cannot eradicate them that is true you cannot eradicate the passions nor is it expedient you should for as we are the workmanship of infinite wisdom so doubtlessly the propensities he has formed us with are in themselves very good but then their good or ill ten∣dency must be determined by this single question whether they govern us or we govern them in the latter case they re∣semble those salutary breezes which waft health and sweetness on their wings in page      the former they may be compared to cer∣tain hurricanes which tear up all before them and deform the beauteous aspect of the most luxuriant climates there is more felicity to be found in the world than is often supposed but never let us pretend to look for it before we have si∣lenced the passions the perpetual con∣tention we must have with them will else interrupt our successful search pride my dear girls is a vice that springs up in the mind almost without her attending to it its characters are an im∣moderate selflove conceitedness and ar∣rogance with a profound contempt of every other person ever insatiable in its desire of respect extremely susceptible of the slightest affronts and jealous of the least tribute of applause paid to another persons of this cast cannot in the nature of things be happy as they may be said to live in a state of hostility with all the world like ishmael they have their hands against page      every man and every mans hand is against them ambition condemns its wretched vo∣tary to forego the sweets of content and pre∣sent ease for the uneasy dreams of rank and power it is happy for the world when fate denies to the ambitious that power to which their desires are perpetu∣ally aspiring innumerable are the hor∣rid deeds which the historic page records that have been perpetrated by the impulse of this restless passion yet if in pity to mankind its direful effects are restrained still the bosom where it rages must be a prey to inexpressible agonies envy is a natural attendant on pride and ambition it has very aptly been com∣pared to a vulture preying on the vitals and there could not possibly have been de∣vised a more expressive similitude that mind which is capable of regarding with the least degree of regret the more fortu∣nate page      acquirements of another as a per∣petual source of disquietude and must ever pine beneath the inexpressible misery which is both the consequence and the pu∣nishment of so base a propensity as en∣vy is the meanest of all the passions so in its own nature it is the most opposite to happiness covetousness is a vice that absorbs eve∣ry finer feeling of the soul whatever sordid satisfaction the miser may feel in a∣massing his treasures yet the cares which unavoidably attend it and the solicitude the preservation of it demands more than balance the selfish gratification he knows nothing of the sweet emotions of charity and benevolence and must be ever a stran∣ger to the noble sensations they excite—it is well if the suggestions of his bound∣less avarice do not prompt him beyond the bounds of integrity the honesty of a covetous person can be but doubtful at the best page      a revengeful disposition is as dreadful to society as burdensome to itself it is the whirlwind of the soul which under its dominion resembles a fury of the in∣fernal regions what sad catastrophes have been effected by revenge what in∣expressible torment overwhelms the heart where that dreadful venom operates it is easy to perceive by the slightest glance that every one of the passions here enumerated are totally destructive of peace there can be no such thing as tranquillity in the breast which they inhabit let it then be the care of my dearest girls to guard against the fatal ascendancy of either of them there cannot be a more lamen∣table object than a human being who sub∣mits to become the sport of passions a barque in a storm driven by winds and shattered by the tempest exhibits but a faint picture of such a wretch whose days pass in continual anguish he looks for peace but finds despair casts oblique re∣flections page      on the wisdom and goodness of providence distrusts his attributes cuff∣es his own being and dies if possible more wretched than he lived the infinitely wise and good creator saw the abundant evil that would accrue to mankind from the degeneracy of the pas∣sions and therefore in his goodness deter∣mined at an appointed time to promulgate a religion the aim of which should be to regulate the passions and direct them to their proper channel such is the chris∣tian revelation in its ends and nature an antidote to moral evil perhaps the natural passions of the hu∣man mind may be reduced to two—the love of pleasure and the love of praise and from the corruptions of these may be traced every irregular affection of the heart—when men no longer knew the true source from whence to look for happiness or approbation it is not much wonder it page      should be sought in power riches and pre∣eminence not that the love of these should branch into selflove vain glory and all the other evil passions which cause so much misery in the world the regulation of the heart and its de∣sires is a point then of the utmost impor∣tance since on it depends your present peace and eternal glory keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life and when you have repelled the approach of any passion guard still more effectually against its en∣trance by endeavouring to establish in your mind the contrary virtue—as for in∣stance subdue pride and cherish humility guard against the desire of power and rich∣es by attaining that poverty of spirit which is content with little and desires no ap∣plause but that of heaven never lose sight of this truth—that there is no happiness adequate to the ca∣pacities page    0 of the human soul but what is found in the exercise of piety and virtue nor any praise worthy her regard but what results immediately therefrom page  unnumbered letter iv the most glorious conquest you can possibly obtain is that of yourselves so∣lomon was of opinion that he who could govern his own spirit had attained a much higher point of dominion than if he should rule a kingdom it is certainly much easier to give wise and upright laws to others than to obey them ourselves and when you can controul your own in∣clination you will have learned the whole essence of moral philosophy but a negative virtue is not all that is to be attained although thousands content with it maintain through life the character of good sort of people—the epithet however contains no very high eulogium those good kind of folks seldom rise above a mediocrity in goodness it certainly is page      not sufficient to abstain from evil a chris∣tian must be distinguished by active virtue the christian religion is a beautiful comment on the moral law the priest who passed by the wounded jew was for aught we are told to the contrary a very good sort of man and had some sentiments of compassion for he went and looked on the poor creature and no doubt kindly wished it had been in his power to relieve him but the good the benevolent sama∣ritan was the generous active friend whose character will never be read without being admired the lawyer also possessed a tolerable share of negative merit having always kept the commandments yet says our saviour thou lackest one thing—that heroic benevolence which disregards all attention to selfish gratification in the no∣ble ardour with which it contributes to the necessities of mankind these instances are fine illustrations of the mosaic dispensation and eminently page      tend to exalt human nature to the highest possible perfection it is not enough say the gospel tenets that ye refrain from ac∣tual violence to any one—you shall love your enemies and do good to those that hate you severe injunction—yet you see by it to how refined a pitch the virtue of a christian must aspire do not then rest satisfied with being as just or kind as the letter of the law exacts—be actively good and seek occasions of exercising your kindness and charity—to administer as far as we are able to the wants of our fellow creatures—to reclaim the vicious—to vindicate the character of the injured—assert the claims of the friend∣less and oppressed—reconcile differences and be indefatigable in the promotion of peace and happiness to all within the com∣pass of our ability are employments wor∣thy of a rational being there are many cases that occur in life wherein those who will obey only the page      rules of legal justice must fall short of those notions of honesty which natural reason and conscience suggest as a good mind wants not the bonds of human laws so on some occasions it rises to a generosi∣ty that is superior to their narrow limits obey the innate ideas of rectitude which god himself has stamped on the human soul—and think it not sufficient to be just except you are generous also let your conduct be regulated by the nicest rules of propriety and prudence and let your bosoms glow with the enthu∣siasm of virtue that you may ever shine forth the steady zealous friend the bene∣volently active neighbour and the truly useful member of society considering yourselves as citizens of the world whose only business it is to do good page  unnumbered letter v but so exalted and refined a turn of sentiment is never the production of ignorance it is only in cultivated minds we must look for it for the prime fruits of virtue grow not in the soil that has never been broken up by moral instruc∣tion a virtuous and intelligent friend is perhaps the most valuable acquisition a young person can make but as one of this description may never sall to your lot supply the want thereof as well as you can by books by all means cultivate a taste for reading but take care that your taste be a just one—that is be more desirous of instruction than amusement or you will profit but little by literary pursuits those who read merely to please the page      imagination may be sure of not reading to advantage and do seldom acquire a relish for works of solid merit and utility i have never known a young person who was passionately fond of novels capable of relishing any thing superior to them for my own part i had rather see a girl wholly ignorant of the alphabet than at∣tached to that species of writing for i am convinced that infinitely more have erred in the conduct of life from that cause than from any other the senti∣ments and ideas they impress are fatal illusions to mislead the poor reader who after wasting days and years in the study is still an utter stranger to the world she lives in—and what is worse inspired with the most erroneous notions of it which commonly lead to some false step or illjudged connection that secures her a wretch for life it cannot be other∣wise—for the scenes characters and in∣cidents these books describe are to be found no where but in the authors ro∣mantic page      fancy they have nothing to do with the real knowledge of the world and consequently those who think to steer through it by such guides must in the end find themselves mistaken just as well may a traveller think to make the tour of europe by a chart of asia if curiosity must be amused and the imagination pleased why may not the understanding be improved at the same time this is very practicable for there are many works of genius extreme∣ly well calculated to answer each of these ends but they are not the histo∣ries of sir such a one miss what dye call um or any of those futile produc∣tions which the press daily emits to vi∣tiate the taste and corrupt the princi∣ples of the age there is a certain mental vigour ne∣cessary to virtue as well as to happiness but modern novels under the specious page      mask of refined sentiments introduce a dangerous softness that has often destroy∣ed both true refinement is the glory of a rational creature but whatever en∣ervates the mind must debase it ly∣curgus thought so i suppose when he banished the poets from his common∣wealth yet surely he lived near enough to athens to have learned to draw a proper line between ferocity and effemi∣nacy the passion for novelty so inherent in youth may be abundantly gratified by the study of history here you meet with new and uncommon events—be∣come acquainted with a variety of cha∣racters and are enabled to form a just estimate of mankind for except allow∣ing for a few local customs or prejudi∣ces human nature was the same two thousand years ago as at this time there is something extremely agreeable to the mind in weighing and examining the page      actions of celebrated personages who in their day made the mighty tremble—in marking the rise or fall of empires and to be able to determine the secret causes of those revolutions which once astonished the world the ages appear as inconsiderable points to those who are acquainted with history—they see the various nations of the earth pass in review before them and trace a more than human power busy in the affairs of men—by taking in at one com∣prehensive view so vast a tract of time they discern the nice connections of that scheme of providence which often appears broken and irregular when contemplated only through the medium of a few years it is almost impossible to be well versed in the characters of the politer nations of antiquity without watching something of that magnanimity which distinguished them and i know not why an acquaint∣ance page    0 with their manners should not be thought as necessary in the system of fe∣male education as it usually is in that of the other sex if the greek and ro∣man veterans displayed qualities which the heroes of the present day would be proud to imitate their wives and daugh∣ters were often patterns of such virtue as would be allowed to dignify a lady of the eighteenth century read modern history as well as antient—the knowledge of the nations who inha∣bit the globe as well as yourselves is amus∣ing and interesting—the heart too may be the better for it—narrow prejudices are removed and the better mankind be∣come acquainted with each other the more the divine principle of philanthropy must be extended national enmity has no other parent but ignorance—the enlight∣ened the philosophic mind even through the veil of different tongues and customs can discern a kindred being—a mem∣ber page      of that universal family whose head is the deity next to travelling itself nothing tends more to enlarge the ideas than journals of travels and voyages if the writers have been faithful and accurate and you will read them with infinite pleasure if you have been careful to acquire a knowledge of geography this renders you familiar with the countries you read of—you re∣collect their soil climate and productions —know their respective boundaries and can readily mark out their place on the globe having thus my dear girls pointed out to you so exhaustless a source of amuse∣ment i will only for the present add that i am c page  unnumbered letter vi as long as curiosity continues a leading feature in the human character biography will form a favourite species of reading every body is eager to pry into the private character of a celebrated per∣sonage and are better pleased to know how such an one acts in domestic life than in the senate or the field and indeed it is there that the best estimate of the real description can be formed the private lives of famous persons afford much edification to the reader the vice or meanness too often there displayed teaches us not to be dazzled by the blaze of popularity or power and to contemn that virtue which is built on the desire of fame alone if on the other hand by following these darlings of fame to the clo∣set page      or the fireside we discover the same nobleness of heart that distinguishes them with the multitude justly they become patterns for our example the mind re∣joices to find something about them that is imitable for though few are called forth as distinguished actors on the theatre of the world all may if they please be great in private life that is may acquire those amiable qualities of mind which can on∣ly constitute real greatness without which the hero is no more than a hypocrite and even the robe of royalty but a tinsel or∣nament to cover real meanness your chief aim should be the know∣ledge of the human heart and that is in general more fully discovered in trifling traits and circumstances than by impor∣tant actions performed under the public eye but you no where find human na∣ture so impartially delineated as in the sacred writings there the historians neither influenced by passion nor preju∣dice page      relate both actions and their se∣cret springs with unerring candour never calumniating enemies or stooping to flat∣ter the favourites of their nation the jewish writers had the fairest op∣portunities imaginable for exaggerating the virtues of their heroes considering the miraculous powers so often exerted in their behalf such an adventure as that of david with goliah would have been thought by a pagan writer sufficient grounds for exalting his favorite to a god yet the inspired biographer has drawn that prince with all his frailties about him all the inequality of humanity sometimes glowing with the rapturous devotion of a seraphim—at others enslaved by the meanest passions such instances of can∣dour considered with the national pride of the jews leave no room to doubt the veracity of the sacred penman on any oc∣casion page      the scriptures also finely illustrate many parts of profane history we are told of embattled armies and cities level∣led with the dust but it is only in holy writ we find those armies prophetically marshalled and that destruction denoun∣ced perhaps an hundred years before the event these are instances which im∣press the mind with reverence for the sa∣cred records and fill it with august ideas of the eternal providence the works of our best moralists will not be unentertaining to you if your taste for reading be as good as i wish it a∣mongst the productions of this kind are the spectator and the rambler as conspi∣cuous for the elegance of their language as the soundness of their morality but there are no better rules for the moral con∣duct of life than are found in the writings of solomon and the son of sirach which though composed so many ages ago may yet be read to much advantage by those page      who would pass through life happily and and respect if you are fond of poetry be careful to read only what is good of it there is a kind of versification that tends to debase the mind—wherever immortality or in∣delicacy is found such must ever be the effect elegance of numbers though a re∣quisite is yet the lowest recommendation of good poetry—its characteristics are dignity of thought purity of expression and above all the best principles of piety and morality for this reason those poe∣tical pieces extant in the bible are by good judges allowed to be truly sublime poet∣ry in its original state being only the har∣monious effusions of a mind glowing with elevated sentiments of generosity gratitude and devotion many of the psalms are noble compositions and neither for beau∣ty of figure or energy of expression have ever been excelled page      natural history affords a delightful stu∣dy—it is not however expected that you should have a systematic idea of every ve∣getable animal or insect but it is un∣pardonable for one who is blest with lei∣sure and opportunity not to have at least a general knowledge of the most conspicu∣ous of natures works—to be ignorant of the beauty and properties of those is to wander over the fair creation as thomson expresses it with brute unconscious gaze the curious and intelligent spec∣tator finds the variegated face of nature a source of rational amusement and reads in glowing characters the wisdom of the deity it is not in such pursuits that the human mind acquires those illiberal sen∣timents which so often disgrace it—all it here finds is noble and beneficent worthy that divine author whom to know and a∣dore in the proper glory of an intelligent being page      akenside has so elegantly expressed the pleasures attending a taste for the study and beauties of nature that i will relieve you from the tediousness of this epistle by tran∣scribing a few of his admired lines o blest of heaven whom not the languid songs of luxury the syren not the bribes of fordid wealth nor all the gaudy spoils of pageant honour can seduce to leave those ever blooming sweets which from the store of nature fair imagination culls to charm th enlivend soul what tho not all of mortal offspring can attain the height of envied life tho only few possess patrician treasures or imperial state yet natures care to all her children just endows at large whatever happy man will deign to use them  for him the spring distils her dews and from the silken gem its lucid leaves unfolds for him the hand of autumn tinges every fertile branch with blooming gold and blushes like the morn each passing hour sheds tribute from her wings page      and still new beauties meet his lonely walk and loves unfelt attract him—not a breeze flies oer the meadow not a cloud imbibes the setting suns effulgence not a strain from all the tenants of the warbling shade ascends but whence his bosom can partake fresh pleasure unreprovd—nor then partakes fresh pleasure only for the attentive mind by this harmonious action on her powrs becomes herself harmonious wont so oft in outward things to meditate the charm of sacred order soon she seeks at home to find a kindred order to exert within herself this elegance of love this fair inspired delight her temperd powrs refine at length and evry passion wears a chaster milder more attractive mein thus the men whom natures works can charm with god himself hold converse grow familar day by day with his conceptions act on his plan and form to his the relish of their souls page  unnumbered letter vii amongst the accomplishments necessary to the female character i think needle work may claim the first place it having so close a connection with neatness which is indisputably requisite to render you comfortable to yourselves or amiable in the esteem of others the ladies of the last century certainly held needlework in much greater estimation than those of the present witness the many laborious performances that yet remain as proofs of their amazing industry in this respect—but the world is ever prone to extremes and because this art was then pursued to the exclusion of every intellectual accom∣plishment there are many in our days who seem to think it beneath their study or ambition the mahometan sentiment which pre∣vailed some years ago of the inferiority of the female mind seems exploded in this page      age of universal refinement and a wo∣man of cultivated understanding is no longer a phenomenon the paths of knowledge are rendered accessible—men of learning have stooped from the eleva∣tions of science to accelerate the improve∣ments of the other sex—they abridge com∣pile explain for their assistance and ad∣vancement in polite literature make all the use you possibly can of such advantages and be convinced that the cultivation of the mind will exalt you in the estimation of rational beings—will open to you exhaustless sources of amuse∣ment and delight of which the ignorant can have no conception yet be careful my dear girls never to overlook one femi∣nine grace or accomplishment there is a line of character drawn between the sex∣es which neither can pass without becom∣ing contemptible it is not to make you despise those acquirements which have ever been appropriated to the female sex that page      you are incited to mental attainments but to render you still more valuable as wo∣men and the better your minds are cul∣tivated the more you will see the proprie∣ty of attending to those minutiae which be∣come the condition in which providence has placed you i do not see how you can acquit your∣selves tolerably in domestic life without a knowledge of needlework but granting your rank and fortune may place you above the absolute necessity of learning that part of it which is called plain work—yet con∣sider how far the ornamental kinds may be of use to amuse the intervals of pleasures or other pursuits as well as to promote the display of an elegant taste even our in∣nocent amusements require variation and the mind may be agreeably relieved by imitating with the needle the beautiful productions of nature—but there is some∣thing which places a skill in needle work in a much more important point of view page      and that is the inconstancy of fortune which in her capricious moods has been often known to compel those whom once she smiled on to procure their subsistence by those very arts which were acquired only for amusement—whatever may be a resource against that mutability which marks all human affairs becomes an object of importance a proficiency in the arts of domestic management and oeconomy ought justly to be ranked among the accomplishments of a young lady you must be unacquainted with nothing that appertains to good house∣wifery some girls have i known profess so violent an attachment to literary pur∣suits that they are content to remain igno∣rant of common attainments this shews a pitiable weakness—elevated minds are attentive to every thing and believe me it is very possible to possess a competent knowledge of polite literature and be well versed in the methods of well governing a page      house at the same time—the latter quali∣fications have of themselves constituted many an useful character in female life which is more than can be said of the for∣mer blend therefore my beloved girls polite with useful acquirements and you will be what i wish you in writing acquire if possible a good hand yet that is not so essentially necessary as the being able to write grammatically—the violation of the common rules of gram∣mar is an indisputable mark of low breed∣ing and although my lord chesterfield sarcastically said that bad spelling was only allowable in a woman it certainly is not allowable in any one who pretends to an education above the vulgar could you write as fine a hand as even a—n him∣self bad spelling would disgrace the whole the substituting have for has are for is c infallibly sinks you in the estimation of well bred persons in order to avoid errors of this kind habit is to be particu∣larly page      guarded against if in your early years you are not careful to write and spell correctly it is a thousand to one if you ever do you see therefore of what con∣sequence it is that you pay a present atten∣tion to these points i reckon among the useful attainments the ability of penning an epistle with pro∣priety and elegance—many fortunate cir∣cumstances in life may be facilitated there∣by—a well written letter has often effect∣ed what verbal requests have sought in vain—besides this consideration how great∣ly must the sweet intercourse of friendship be improved by a free and intelligent cor∣respondence two friends though placed at the extremities of the globe may thus enjoy all the pleasures of such a connec∣tion but except you attain the desirable habit of expressing your sentiments with∣out embarrassment hope not to enjoy any thing of so delicate a satisfaction letters should be the pictures of the soul and so page      they always would be if people acquired only the skill of expressing their thoughts just as they arise write as you would speak were the persons you address imme∣diately before you there is no more than this necessary to establish that easiness of style which is the chief beauty of epis∣tolary correspondence that good breed∣ing which i hope will be habitual to you will dictate those terms and forms of ad∣dress the condition of those to whom you write requires—we do not always find the most learned people write the most agreeable letters—perhaps for no other reason than that they take too much trou∣ble about it and like the good archbishop of benevento reject the first thought that occurs some that i have known indite an epistle in such a stiff and formal style and load it so disgustfully with tautology that one would almost take it for an act of par∣liament when you write a letter my dear girls forget the idea of pen ink and paper—suppose only you are speaking to page      the person and you will write an agreea∣ble if not a fine letter—to effect the latter something must have been effected by dame nature—however this i know— that the most elevated sentiments would not look graceful in such compositions ex∣cept accompanied by perfect ease and ex∣pression and have the appearance of flow∣ing spontaneously from the heart many excellent models of epistolary writing have been recommended to young proficients you cannot have better than those ascribed to pope ganganelli—whoever was the author he has certainly hit on that ease sprightliness and elegance which it is my earnest wish may characterise whatever falls from your pen would to heaven that all the world possessed the same can∣dor and liberality of sentiment which breathes through every one of those ele∣gant epistles page  unnumbered letter viii when you compare the ankward motions of a rustic with the genteel and graceful movement of a person of education you cannot but be assured of the utility of dancing but it should ne∣ver be forgotten that to give this supe∣riority of mein and air is the chief end of that polite accomplishment—to lose sight of this idea is to take away the real worth of that branch of genteel ed∣ucation—to reduce it to an unimpor∣tant if not pernicious attainment how∣ever a knowledge of dancing may some∣times conduce to social pleasure and in that light be esteemed an agreeable and innocent recreation i cannot help think∣ing that the same application that is re∣quisite to form an opera dancer may very well be dispensed with in a young lady of a different character the ex∣travagant leaps and gestures of some fa∣shionable page      females make me think of the speech of philip of macedon to his son on another occasion—i am ready to ask if they are not ashamed to dance so well there is scarcely a human soul how∣ever apparently dead to sensibility but is in some measure alive to the extatic charms of music the story of orphe∣us is more than a fable—minds almost as inert and inanimate as trees themselves have been moved by the power of har∣monious sounds—why else does the gap∣ing rustic follow with such manifest de∣light the itinerant musician and why but that the effect of music on the pas∣sions is so incontestibly proved has the army adopted the sons of apollo with those of mars since then this science has so great an influence on the feelings of the soul is it not surprizing that the polite world should not be more ambi∣tions of enjoying those sublime sensations page    0 which the best pieces are so abundantly capable of exciting and not rest poorly satisfied with the luke warm pleasures of singsong while the noble compositions of great masters lie bye totally disre∣garded indulge my dear girls a turn for music if nature has given you such but do not permit a song tune or an opera air to be the limits of your excel∣lence in that enchanting science drawing painting c justly form a part of polite education because they fur∣nish an agreeable as well as rational amuse∣ment they lead to a familiarity with the beauties of nature and that can scarce∣ly fail to advance the mind a degree high∣er even to the contemplation of her di∣vine author but if it had not this hap∣py tendency drawing is still a laudable a∣musement because an innocent one and whatever furnishes a recreation of that character may certainly be deemed an auxiliary to virtue page      an acquaintance with the languages of polite nations greatly enlarges the mind it is the property of ignorance to esteem nothing valuable that a foreign country produces and scarcely to allow that its inhabitants are human nothing tends more immediately to remove such illibe∣ral prejudices than studying the language of the people thus despised the super∣cilious contemner is surprised to find them rational and expressing similar ideas with those of his own country if necessity or inclination ever leads you from your native land a previous ac∣quaintance with the language of those you reside among would much facilitate your pleasure and convenience would open to you the avenues of social love and friendship and take off much from those comfortless sensations the mind is apt to feel in the idea of being amongst a people it knows not for this end perhaps it may be sufficient to acquire a knowledge page      of the french tongue that being general∣ly understood by intelligent persons of every european nation but there is another advantage attending this branch of polite accomplishment and which pro∣bably to you my dear girls will be the most useful—i mean the being able to read in their original those beautiful composi∣tions which lose many of their excellencies by translation for this reason become ac∣quainted also with the itasian but ho∣mer and virgil you tell me have beauties that can never be translated—true yet these i fancy you must be content to taste as pure as the labors of the learned afford them the greek and latin tongues form∣ing no part in the polite system of female education at present nor certainly ever can in the useful arithmetic is a dry study yet certain∣ly a very useful one to those who would manage their affairs with oeconomy and prudence—a thorough knowledge of the page      four first rules is sufficient to enable you to do it from a total ignorance of letters in female life we are advanced to an age which requires every girl to be made a grammarian yet it unfortunately hap∣pens that of the numbers who profess to have studied the grammar of their na∣tive tongue few speak or write it with that accuracy which could be wished indeed the progress that women usually make in that science is seldom of itself sufficient to give an habitual elegance of expression they are more indebted for it to frequent reading of the best authors and the conversation of those who have themselves acquired it perfect—what you can acquire of grammar by such assistances of these there is an indis∣pensable necessity for you to write and speak english correctly acquire that qualification as easily as you can but nothing will more facilitate it than the methods i have mentioned page      geography is a study that will please you an hundred times better—this is not like the former a set of dry rules but almost every advance you make therein will abundantly repay your pains by the novelty of the information it produces besides i cannot imagine how the fre∣quent relations that occur in common discourse will be intelligible without some acquaintance with this study i am sure if you are no geographer even a newspaper will be as inexplicable as an egyptian hieroglyphic attain a com∣petent knowledge of the globe on which you live that your apprehension of infi∣nite wisdom may be enlarged which it will be in a much higher degree if you take care to acquire a general idea of the structure of the universe it is not ex∣pected you should become adepts in astro∣nomy but a knowledge of its leading principles you may and ought to obtain the french with their usual attention to the sex have procured them a gentle∣man page      usher if i may so speak to the pla∣netary orbs—fontanelle introduces them to an acquaintance with that bril∣liant assembly—it is not the first instance in which our agreeable neighbours have blended the researches of the scholar with the politeness of a fine gentleman avail yourselves of such ingenious as∣sistances and be all your cornelia wishes page  unnumbered letter ix an accomplished character has so many charms that nothing needs be said to induce you to wish at least for its at∣tainment yet painful application must render that wish effectual—a reflection however that should excite your emulation rather than despondency—trivial acquire∣ments may content the indolent and timid but the arduous and difficult are the pro∣per aim of elevated minds courage be∣longs not to the warrior alone—it is as of∣ten found in the closet as the field that resolution which is necessary for every valuable purpose of life is the fruit only of active minds and was never found with indolence and sloth—determine therefore to conquer every tendency to an inactive temper whenever you feel in yourselves an inaptitude for doing what necessarily ought to be done rouze that page      moment or you will give ground to an enemy the most destructive to happiness and virtue and who once entrenched is hard to be dislodged never defer to the next hour that which should be the busi∣ness of the present whatever thy hand findeth to do do it with all thy might said a very wise man many hun∣dred years ago indeed there is no pre∣cept throughout the sacred writings in∣culcated with greater energy than this of diligence it is the soul of virtue— the foundation of honor and affluence many a bright and shining talent lies hid in a napkin for want of activity to unfold it nor do we unfrequently meet with persons struggling with distresses which require only their own exertions to remove indolence takes hold of the disposition much oftener than is acknow∣ledged it is possible to be wholly under its dominion and yet suspect nothing of it and what is yet more strange to be∣lieve page      ones self to be the most diligent person in the world at the very time you have seen numbers of bustling peo∣ple who are always in a hurry and so perplexed do they appear with business as never to be able to enjoy a friend or themselves it would seem hard at first sight to accuse them of indolence and yet they are of all people most com∣monly under its power for an ha∣bitual diligence would so comfortably arrange the affairs of life that none would be found to intrude on another consi∣der the surprising dispatch with which some in public stations manage a multi∣plicity of the most important concerns —to contemplate them one would al∣most conclude nothing too extensive for the compass of the human mind—dili∣gence is the charm which effects it all in that dismal catalogue of diseases which imbitter mortality not a few owe their existence to indolence the indi∣gent labourer who toils for daily bread page      knows nothing of that sad train of ner∣vous disorders which render life itself burdensome to the wealthy in some cases poverty might justly be called a blessing great are the atchievements which resolution and diligence can effect —in nothing is their power more conspi∣cuously seen than in the cultivation of the mind to reflect on the progress of the human understanding—to compare the refinements of philosophy with a state of savage nature—a newton with an inhabi∣tant of new holland we should almost conclude some supernatural power must have contributed to give the former so in∣finite a superiority in the scale of beings without the quality i have recommended it could never have been attained for though much be owing to accidental ad∣vantages such as the being born in an en∣lightened country afford yet no inconsi∣derable portion of diligence is required to render these advantages personally effec∣tual it is this my dear girls that makes them yours and without it the soul will page    0 remain as uninformed as if destined to a land where science never darts a cheering beam it may seem strange to tell you of old age before you have scarcely passed your infancy yet i must not conceal from you that a period will arrive when exterior at∣tractions will be no more—when mental acquirements will prove your highest lustre and sublimest comfort however despi∣cable an ignorant woman appears at any part of her life in the decline of it she is sure to become far more contemptible at that time it is the improvements she has made in early days that give dignity of character an old age of cards necessari∣ly succeeds a youth of folly pope could not have said any thing more destructive of the insignificancy of those ancient ha∣bits than he has expressed in that concise satire if you would avoid the contempt which never fails to attend a frivolous old age you must pass a youth of diligence and application page      but then the pleasures resulting from it surpass description the satisfactions of a rich cultivated mind are only fully known to the happy possessor one of them we are assured is a noble independence which creates if i may so speak its own happi∣ness is not indebted to dissipation or the caprice of others but can derive from itself exhaustless resources for solitude or society ordinary persons are obliged to fly from ennui to the regions of amuse∣ment but superior beings who have tra∣versed the fields of useful and polite know∣ledge can from themselves select materi∣als for the most exquisite enjoyment do you think this an acquisition worth desiring—then never forget that it can be obtained only by diligence and active in∣dustry habits of indolence are destruc∣tive of every valuable attainment and they are as much so of happiness as they are known to be of virtue page  unnumbered letter x cultivated minds have plea∣sures which surpass the vulgar apprehen∣sion they have their pains as well— for there is an evil peculiar to refined feeling of which the untaught rustic is happily ignorant this happens when refinement or at least the affectation of it is carried to such an extreme that it degenerates into false delicacy the symptoms of the malady are a kind of secret dissatisfaction with every thing— the common blessings of life are despised as inadequate to the refinement of their ideas and every petty slight angmented by such a quickness of perception as leads them to see affronts when none perhaps have been intended and this peevish∣ly irritable temper they are pleased to dignify with the name of sensibility and pique themselves on a disposition that disqualifies them for social virtue or social page      happiness what pity that a quality meant to highten every real blessing should be ascribed to the mere chimera of a sickly brain never may you my dears by indulging these fictitious feelings re∣fine away the felicity which a kind pro∣vidence scatters in your path of life nou∣rish in your bosoms humility and good na∣ture—these will teach you to make the best of your lot whatever it be and give a relish to every enjoyment—all is serene where they reside humility by arro∣gating nothing to herself remains un∣hurt at the supercilious scorn of igno∣rance or pride and goodnature by casting a veil over the foibles of others presents to our view the best side of this motley scene without doubt superior minds have a quicker sense of what is beautiful in nature or desirable in life than a pea∣sant whose ideas extend not beyond his daily occupations—perhaps they feel al∣so page      more acutely the evils of their condi∣tion yet the persons who suffer most by this affected sensicility are not they who have the greatest share of afflictive events but the idly speculative who being em∣ployed to no good purpose have time to nourish those artificial feelings which nature knows nothing of sensibility—what is it—is it not that delicate perception of natural and moral beauty which the creator has implanted in the soul to exalt its happi∣ness and awaken its noblest passions how greatly then do they err who sub∣stitute in the room of this best gift of heaven that which is the very weakness of humanity pride and peevishness it is paying a very poor compliment to literary pursuits to suppose they are productive of that softness which unfits the mind for enduring the common ac∣cidents of life and those attainments page      are of little value that serve no better purpose than to barb the arrows of mis∣fortune with stings which the enlighten∣ed never feel but probably they who dream of such effects are the superficial who never dived beyond the surface of literature and whose feeble intellects are unable to digest even the little they have imbibed if you have really made any advance∣ment in mental improvement it will in∣vigorate the powers of the soul and in∣spire her with that magnanimity which is certainly necessary to the happiness of a being who is every moment expos∣ed to sorrow and disappointment va∣lue not yourselves on any refinements that are short of this effect some i know are even restrained from the exercise of benevolence by this affectation of sensibility their feelings are too tender to bear with scenes of dis∣tress page      and too refined for the duties of social life they therefore keep at an unfriendly distance from society lest the ignorance or rudeness they there may meet with should wound their ex∣cessive delicacy but how is this obey∣ing the injunction of the apostle who exhorts us to be kindly affectioned one to another bearing with each others in∣firmities in fine my dear girls come to the feast of social life accompanied by the virtues of humility and charity and you will not arise dissatisfied from the enter∣tainment page  unnumbered letter xi i have often thought that the great prevalence of vice arises chiefly from a culpable weakness of temper—for there is nothing so amiable in it that it should be followed for its own sake it is the mere want of resolution that betrays such num∣bers into the dreadful abyss of sin and mi∣sery the worlds dread laugh scarce een the firm philosopher can bear but in my opinion he must be a poor philosopher who cannot and would have made but a sorry figure in the portico or lyceum it is not meant to inculcate to you a boisterous imperious carriage may my girls possess every feminine grace and vir∣tue but these cannot be supported with∣out some portion of resolution there is page      a proper firmness without which neither virtue happiness or dignity of character can be long maintained distrust those who extol the soft irresolution of the sex— it is the very rock on which thousands of deluded females have been lost be possessed of the true principles of ho∣nour and rectitude and dare to adhere to them in spite of solicitation or that still more powerful means of temptation ridi∣cule establish your opinions on truth and reason and maintain them when necessa∣ry with firmness—some people give up both their faith and their friends for want of resolution to defend them too weak to think too indolent to chuse in business and the affairs of life a proper firmness is indispensably necessary those who can be influenced by every ad∣viser or intimidated at every appearance of difficulty must of course be desultory page      and unsettled they affect nothing of con∣sequence because they know not how to persevere in any undertaking obstacles will attend the best concerted schemes and mankind will ever think differently about them but the truly wise will await with steady patience the issue of those measures they have been careful to found in pru∣dence and the moral fitness of things some will undertake nothing till they see the path smooth before them and attain almost a certainty of success such will find their lives wasted before they have determined on the plan of it those who best know the state of humanity will be convinced that to design prudently and act firmly is all that can be done by mortals without resolution it will sometimes be impossible to act agreeably to the dic∣tates of right reason and virtue for these are not always the ton and when that is the case no inconsiderable share of forti∣tude page    0 is requisite to repel the attacks of ri∣dicule or amusement—nor can the trea∣sures of knowledge be explored without a portion of it—for there is nothing truly valuable to be attained without pains and labour dismayed at the prospect the indolent as described by solomon cry a lion is in the street—rather may my dear girls be animated with a nobler ar∣dour to surmount every difficulty which would retard their acquisition of merit and selicity parnassus itself was a craggy rock but then the muses dwelt on its top but if resolution be necessary to the attaining whatever is valuable or desirable in life it is no less so to the supporting us under a deprivation of it the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong—hence it follows that the wisest measures do not always meet with suceess nor can virtue itself prevent the encroach∣ments of affliction—in such circumstances fortitude gives a dignity to suffering and page      tends also to alleviate the weight of it every one knows the sentiment of the phi∣losopher— that a good man struggling with adversity is a sight on which the gods themselves might look down with delight however that be it is certain that such a character never fails to com∣mand the respect and veneration of man∣kind magnanimity of all the qualities of the mind seems most secure of admi∣ration the saviour of the world incul∣cated it when having forwarned his disci∣ples of their approaching sufferings he enjoined them to possess their souls in pa∣tience patience is amongst the christian duties what magnanimity is in the list of heroic virtues they are synonimous terms—both imply that calm unshaken fortitude which is at once characteristic of the hero and the christian  but do not conclude this firmness of mind—this laudable resolution is calcula∣ted only to be admired it is of the high∣est page      actual service to the unfortunate not only by enabling them to sustain the bur∣den of their sufferings but by opening a way to better prospects the timid and irresolute sink at the approach of adversity into a despondency the most unfriendly to their affairs by precluding that courage∣ous industry which might render them more tolerable and therefore by the na∣ture of things augment the very evils of which they complain cultivate in all circumstances this in∣nate constancy—it will aid you in the at∣tainment of every good and valuable end in prosperity will secure you from the corruptions of vanity—impart dignity and serenity to adversity in fine you cannot i think but be steady in the practice of virtue if you are firm in the expectation of its rewards page  unnumbered letter xii my epistles to you my dear girls are written without the least attention to method their respective subjects have more the appearance of chance than de∣sign and therefore may be justly cal∣led cursory thoughts on various subjects young folks i know do not love precise rules and perhaps you deem the irregu∣larity of my letters their chief merit al∣low them however one more—that of sincerity and believe that the sentiments they contain flow from the heart i be∣lieve i need not add the word sponta∣neously as i disclaim all methodical arrange∣ment of my subjects i will here give you my thoughts on that very important part of female study dress be not afraid that i am about to confine you to a primitive plainness though probably such a mode page      may be found more advantageous to beau∣ty and elegance than modern finery yet i shall recommend that which is at once agreeable to fashion and your own rank and circumstances to reconcile these three conditions is no easy task yet herein lies a chief perfection of the female character few women possess the happy art—yet those who do must be allowed a very superior degree of merit it is no inconsiderable trait in the character of an amiable young lady that she knows how to support a genteel appearance and yet pay a just regard to the frugality which probably her limited circumstances re∣quire a fantastical and expensive turn in dress is the certain mark of a little mind but that attention to it which principally regards neatness is extremely laudable resolve to be always neat or you can ne∣ver be welldressed—a dirty ruffle a torn apron c are sufficient to disgrace page      the most splendid apparel neatness is al∣ways in your power and will always ren∣der you respectable in whatever rank of life you are placed but finery without it is nothing more than a ridiculous glare which is never seen but with disgust fashion has imposed some general rules which may innocently be followed under the restrictions i have mentioned your clothes may be made according to the mode though the materials which compose thern be less costly than if they belonged to a dutchess an uncouth illfashioned habit derogates even from the importance of a philosopher and it is not till after a near acquaintance that merit is discovered through a shabby garment—so much are mankind governed by appear∣ance prithee good xenocrates said plato to his pupil sacrifice to the graces that great man knew how much the mental ac∣complishments page      complishments might be illustrated and adorned by a polished exterior—a wise person it is true would not make this al∣together the criterion of merit yet per∣haps would not readily look for worth be∣neath an ungraceful exterior after all my dear girls esteem the frivolous though often troublesome arts of dress but as a tax you are in some sort obliged to pay to the folly of the age remember on all occasions that external ornaments cannot make you better or hap∣pier women great minds however they may have judged it necessary to conform to insignificant customs have always re∣garded them in their proper light the attention such are seen to shew to the idol fashion is only a good natured condescen∣sion to the weakness of mankind in points they judge of an indifferent nature and much too trifling to become the objects of their serious cares the silly and ignor∣ant are they who love dress for its own sake page  unnumbered letter xiii next to our own principles we are to regard those of our companions for they are almost of as much impor∣tance to us as by long and intimate ac∣quaintance they generally become our own virtuous habits are strengthened by example—so are vicious ones but in a much higher degree nothing there∣fore can be a point of greater conse∣quence than the choice of companions a great deal has been written on the subject and every one who has the care of youth fails not to inculcate the keep∣ing good company—the only misfor∣tune is that the term has seldom been sufficiently explained and the young mind is left to annex to it the ideas of birth and fortune till by degrees the ex∣pression is supposed to imply both these qualifications page      the result has been the disturbance of all order in social life—each class of people quitting their own sphere to as∣sociate with those of superior rank and these again inspired by the same senti∣ment repel with scorn the ambitious at∣tempt solicitous only to attract the no∣tice of still greater folks than themselves thus in the room of that social amity with which the human heart should over∣flow it is unhappily divided between the throbbings of ambition and the pangs of offended pride it is evident that in this bustle great∣er attention is paid to the accidental cir∣cumstances of rank and affluence than to real merit we should not else so of∣ten see people of the middling rank when flattered by the notice of a supe∣rior so elated with the honour of keep∣ing what they call good company when perhaps that superior is conspicu∣ous for almost every vice and meanness page      this is a grand mistake surely—as fatal to happiness as to morals good company can only mean persons of noble sentiments refined manners and enlightened understandings but these qualities are not to be expected where the scantiness of fortune has absolutely exclud∣ed the means of education for the human mind becomes every thing by culture it is therefore found that in the lower ranks of society where poverty has denied time and abilities for that happy employ the worst habits and most depraved morals prevail for this reason you are not to chuse companions from such a class in fine your associates must be those of a liberal and virtuous education it may happen you may find a friend of this description whose relative or necessary connection may not be eligible for you in this case she is by no means a proper companion as her own merit however page    0 great will not compensate for the danger you incur in frequently mingling with per∣sons of improper character a cultivated mind is the proper soil for every moral and social virtue—it is most likely to be found where heaven has bestowed an easy fortune consequently the genteeler ranks of life will be most likely to afford you proper companions but here let merit alone and not adven∣titious circumstances influence your selec∣tion—despise that contemptible weakness which piques itself on the rank rather than the mental value of an acquaintance and never let a principle of vanity lead you to the servile imitation of vice or folly how∣ever sanctioned by wealth or titles little minds are ever dazzled by shew and splen∣dour— it is the property of the enlighten∣ed only to distinguish personal worth from external advantages i should think you disgraced by an acquaintance with an em∣press if she was not as much distinguished by virtue as power page      be careful not to form an acquaintance too hastily—many a virtuous girl has funk for ever in the esteem of the world by be∣ing seen in company with those of doubt∣ful reputation in vain she declares her ignorance of the real character of her com∣panions she having admitted them to her society without the requisite investi∣gation of that point infallibly renders her own prudence suspected a very extensive acquaintance is not necessary to social happiness a few se∣lect friends will most conduce to that end and it is among these that the free full converse of the friendly heart flows with uninterruption and delight— unfeigned chearfulness and real enjoy∣ment exist much oftener in these little circles than in large and ceremonious as∣semblies but should your station in life render a large acquaintance unavoidable page      you will observe to all a free unrestrain∣ed politeness without admitting every one indiscriminately to your confidence be ever frank and easy without revealing your own secrets or those of your friends and make none your intimates but those of worth and honour  much very much of human happiness depends on the proper choice of acquain∣tance —an ill chosen friend has power to mar our felicity as much as an amiable and faithful one contributes to it the heart is formed for social intercourse and when that intercourse is founded on the moral and religious virtues it gives a zest to the other enjoyments of life page  unnumbered letter xiv there are certain restrictions ne∣cessary to render the gift of speech what the great creator designed it—a princi∣pal means of happiness to his rationl crea∣tures the first of these is an habitual care never to violate the laws of truth the pleasures resulting from mutual con∣versation vanish entirely when no de∣pendence can be placed in the speakers veracity those who speak merely from the suggestions of imagination or what is worse malignity are justly charge∣able with half the strife that disturbs the peace of society such persons are the most dangerous companions and need only to be known to be generally dispis∣ed and avoided indeed so high a re∣gard veracity obtains among people of refinement that you cannot offer a more gross affront than to accuse them of the violation of it page      of all that has been said in admira∣tion of catos character nothing reflects so great a lustre on it as that striking though tacit eulogium bestowed on him in one of the roman courts of judica∣ture where a cause being to be tried which required two witnesses and one only appearing the judge declared he could not dispense with the law even though cato himself were the witness besides as archbishop tillotson fine∣ly observes a constant adherence to truth has the least trouble and difficulty in it it sits always upon the lips where∣as a lye is troublesome and needs a great many more to make it good next to the character of a liar that of the detracter is the most odious—a habit of traducing the reputation of others by speaking all the ill we have heard of them or putting the worst con∣structions on their actions is totally op∣posite page      to the spirit of christianity which breathes nothing but candour and cha∣rity there is also something extreme∣ly mean in the practice as the accused persons have seldom an opportunity of refuting the charge the cruel asper∣sion is borne on the wings of scandal from circle to circle nor perhaps reach∣es the injured party till the wound given to reputation is too deep for cure barbarous as such a custom is i need not say how greatly it prevails in almost all companies i have however the charity to believe it does not always pro∣ceed from malice or envy when no knowledge has been treasured up in the mind—no useful information acquired conversation cannot receive aid from in∣tellectual stores—what then must be∣come of it—must it flag and silence—dreadful silence reign—no something must rekindle it and when no ration∣al subject arises that something must be page      scandal this though it may be a pal∣liation of the crime is yet no excuse for the wounds given by unmeaning ig∣norance are as deep as those inflicted by premeditated rancour how shameful is it that an impertinent eagerness for talking should thus wantonly explore the secret recesses of domestic life and presume to judge of actions the motives of which cannot be scanned by these ig∣norant prattlers the most effectual way to secure yourselves from the commission of this vice will be the adorning your minds with such acquisitions of knowledge and useful intelligence as will enable you to furnish subjects for conversation with∣out descending to frivolity or detraction but should you not be so happy as to pos∣sess these desirable resources i hope you will have so much candour and goodnature as to be content with being ac∣counted a dull and lifeless companion rather than indulge an eagerness for talk∣ing page      at the expence of other peoples good name detraction is not only a violation of the rules of religion but is also so impo∣litic a crime as no one who wishes to be well received in the world would ever commit—for a person who is ad∣dicted to scandal is a terror to society the respect they receive resembles the homage the indians are said to pay to the devil rather to evade his maligni∣ty than procure his love and how∣ever curiosity may for a while listen to an illnatured anecdote yet be assur∣ed the relator is regarded with a secret disgust by every benevolent person who naturally expects to meet the same cen∣sorious fate when opportunity serves good policy will therefore correct a censorious disposition yet i trust your restraint will be derived from a superior motive namely the obligations of reli∣gion which forbid to speak evil of any page      or to judge uncharitably of another the consciousness of having always obeyed these divine injunctions will afford the consolation under the pain you may perhaps feel from the unjust aspersions of others—for such probably you will meet with in your journey of life as no innocence can always be a defence from unmerited censure and when this chan∣ces to be your case you will derive un∣speakable comfort from the reflection of having treated the world more gene∣rously than it has treated you whatever you say should be meant for the entertainment or instruction of the company rather than the gratifica∣tion of vanity many are so much actu∣ated by selflove that they never speak or act but to be applauded hence ari∣ses affectation—the most disgusting qua∣lity in nature diliver your sentiments as they occur without affecting more graces in your tone or gesture than page      are your own—these well managed will be enough to render you amiable all may be agreeable in their natural sphere but when they innovate on that of others the attempt is commonly frustrated above all never affect that kind of wit which aims at severe retorts and re∣partee—it has generally illnature for its basis and seldom makes a sally but it procures an enemy if it does not lose a friend there is nothing in it to be ad∣mired but the readiness of thought which gives it birth—but when the qua∣lity seems aimed at rather than possessed it is absolutely contemptible in fine—sincerity candour and good sense must be the ornaments of your conversation politeness will give an agreeable lustre to these qualities but remember it can never be a substitute for them page  unnumbered letter xv hail politeness power divine says the sonnet and surely no necessary invocation for politeness dear girls is the friend of social happiness and dome∣stic peace if it was the fashion in this age to have household gods i would surely give it a preeminent place amongst them i know not how it happens but peo∣ple seem to think they are obliged to be polite every where but at home—and there it is they are most required to be so for the refined satisfaction of so∣cial intercourse cannot long subsist with∣out it i am convinced that domestic quarrels and disgusts would much sel∣domer arise if the parties were always as polite as affectionate but what is politeness—is it the law of fashion or a system of rules—no—it page      is the divine principle of benevolence branched into a thousand little chan∣nels and flowing through all the mi∣nutiae of human life education may improve but can never give it for it must be founded in the soul or is never seen in full perfection a painter may learn the rules of design and the com∣pendium of colours but if he possesses not the enthusiasm of the art his pic∣tures will be lifeless and insipid politeness is that a miable disposition which delights in the happiness of others—consults their ease—prevents their wants—and yields them every possible convenience this is the source of those civilities and attentions which distin∣guish a wellbred person—without it etiquette dwindles into unmeaning cere∣mony you perceive then that not only an attention to external graces but a regu∣lation page      of the disposition is necessary to constitute a polite person acquire the amiable temper i have described and you will infallibly please with that na∣tive ease which is thought so requisite to be attained that the world has sub∣stituted in its room its wretched resem∣blance effrontery—but no more like the amiable original than an ordinary statue to the venus of medicis i have often thought that the best christian is likely to be the most polite person this is an assertion you have not been used to hear yet may well enough be warranted by the tenor of the gospel precepts which inculcate the being ten∣der of anothers weakness—to prefer each other in honor—to give respect where due—with others to the like purpose now if these excellent lessons contain as i think will be allowed the substance of what at this day is termed good breeding st paul must be a better page      teacher than my lord chesterfield him∣self since he breathes the enlivening spirit without which the ceremonial code is a lifeless system calculated per∣haps to disguise the heart but not to add one iota to the real happiness of social life page  unnumbered letter xvi nothing is more talked of than religion—nothing less understood—with∣out comprehending what it really is the spirit of bigotry would arrogate the whole nor allow of its being without the contra∣cted pale of a particular sect i have juster notions of religion—see it as it is—not a mode of ceremonies but a divine principle influencing the whole moral conduct its simple fixed and de∣terminate sense is briefly love of god and good will to mankind this dear girls is the sum of all religion without it vain were the oblations of the jewish church—vain are the ceremonials of the christian the love of god is an expression that of late years has been as grossly abu∣sed as the word religion strange as it may page      appear there have been those who lead∣ing the most immoral lives have stiled themselves the lovers of the god of puri∣ty—whose tongues could utter a pious eja∣culation while their hands were com∣mitting the most flagitious crimes but be not deceived—this exalted character belongs neither to bigotry nor enthusi∣asm the love of god is not a passion but a rational principle it is those senti∣ments of reverence and gratitude which naturally arise in a generous mind when reflecting on one supreme beneficent pow∣er who is the immediate author of all good and the fountain of all perfection this conviction is the parent of unaffect∣ed piety the soul cannot but adore the being she believes to be allwise almigh∣ty and eternal—she cannot but love him who is the source of unnumbered blessings nor chuse but dread to offend him whose nature she believes to be holi∣ness hence the source of moral virtue—sin is avoided because displeasing to the page      will of the deity and virtuous disposi∣tions are acquired because agreeable to a power who is able to reward every endea∣vour to please him with eternal and un∣speakable happiness such a filial rational love must be the fruit of every mind that is not ignorant of the being and attributes of god—or that has not received from bigotry or su∣perstition any mistaken notions of him to prevent being disturbed by the spiri∣tual pride of hypocritical fanatics remem∣ber there is an invariable test by which you may know if you have the love of god ask your own heart if it seeks the favour of the deity above every other consideration if it values this more than its dearest interests and even life itself a ready affirmative puts the question out of all doubt be assured my dear girls that nothing so highly elevates and adorns page      the human character as a steady ration∣al piety—nor is any thing capable of yielding so pure and exalted a happiness to the soul as an habit of devotion no one who has experienced the vicissitude of sublunary things but must highly value the privilege of possessing a friend that would at all times be acceptable—ready to hear the complaints of affliction and all powerful to relieve them such a friend you may enjoy in the divine being of what consequence is it then that you acquire a taste for the exercises of devotion that you cultivate a friendship with heaven and accustom your hearts to talk with god this is an emphatical expression of david and gives you an idea of rational and sincere prayer—which consists not in formal addresses but is the genuine language of the heart such a divine intimacy has something in it extremely suitable to the noblest sensations of the soul and page      therefore may well be sought after as a source of refined and exquisite felicity in trouble you will find it more precious than the balm of gilead—it will shed a ray of sacred peace when the dark clouds of adversity obscure your path—〈◊〉 death but here my pen must stop—there can be no doubt but at that final that awful period the divine attachment breaks forth into a seraphic flame page  unnumbered letter xvii the generality of people style them∣selves christians without understanding the value or the necessity of christianity and perhaps neither the one nor the other can be seen in a proper light without taking a comparative view of the human soul before and after the fall it is not for my humble pen to illustrate the excellency of a system which has god himself for its author—nor is it my design to attempt a task so far above my abilities yet that you may not wholly take your re∣ligion upon trust i would call your atten∣tion to what man was when first created but a little inferior to angels his reason was clear his soul all purity and his mind all intelligence—fit companion for natures wholly spiritual and enjoying the most familiar intercourse with them that page   00 grand question which has since agitated the schools of philosophy of what was the chief good of man was all apparent to the first of the human race he saw perfectly clear that it consisted in the entire assimi∣lation of his will to that of the deity—and in the pursuit found a full unmixed felici∣ty but he was created with the power of doing otherwise or where would have been the merit of obedience the duty of free agency must be far preferable to that which arises from blind necessity adam continued a happy being as long as his will remained consonant to that of his maker but at the instant it deviated therefrom he fell from happiness and per∣fection the conciseness of the scripture history leaves unthinking minds in doubt as to the nature of adams transgression but undoubtedly it originated in the mere desire of doing contrary to the divine com∣mand—he forgot that the diety was his happiness and he sought it in his own will page   0  it was herein he sinned and not simply by eating the forbidden fruit for at the very moment adam became capable of imagining there might be a good abstract from the favour of god—that moment he fell the creator saw at one comprehensive view the miseries which would accrue to mankind from the voluntary perversion of the intellectual and moral powers— then was the scheme of christianity devis∣ed as an effectual means of restoring hu∣man nature to the happiness and perfection it originally possessed the purposed blessing was graciously announced in that prediction that the posterity of eve should crush the serpents head the human reason thus clouded it is almost surprising to reflect by what rapid steps the world became immersed in the worst ignorance and vice those who still retained some idea of the sovereign crea∣tor page   0  had recourse to a visible symbol of his majesty for their intellectual faculties were too gross to apprehend an immateri∣al deity—it soon happened that the sym∣bol itself was made the object of divine worship and hence doubtless the origin of idolatry which in the time of abraham had so generally spread over the earth that it appeared necessary to the supreme governor of the universe to call that good man from his country and his kindred to ordain him the father of a nation who being by numerous and peculiar laws se∣parated from the rest of the would might preserve uncorrupt the knowledge of the divine nature the bible will convince you how ineffectual not only these laws but the frequent and signal manifestations of almighty power were to secure that people from the grossest idolatry the rights of which were now become so terrible to the imagination that they even burnt their children alive in sacrifices to their horrid idols what a picture is here of human page   0  nature that nature which once so nearly approached the angelic do you not be∣gin to see the necessity of a redeemer let us pursue the thread of history and take a superficial view of the most cele∣brated nations which peopled the earth before the glorious aera of his appearance the egyptians were very early esteem∣ed for learning laws and arts—they were a numerous powerful and wealthy people but so grossly idolatrous that they not on∣ly worshipped images but beasts insects and even vegetables the manufactures and extensive commerce of phoenicia sup∣pose some advance in refinement—but national intercourse in those wretched times served but to promulgate national idolatries babylon that mighty seat of empire surpassed most other nations in the superb materials of her gods astrono∣mers there observed the motions of the heavens and bowed in adoration to the splendid hosts that adorned them cyrus page   0  who erected the persian on the ruins of the babylonish monarchy knew nothing of the almighty being who named him an age before he had existence as the in∣strument of liberty to his captive people alexander who in his turn subverted this extensive empire could only blend his grecian idols with the persian—for dark deplorably dark was every corner of the habitable earth except the inconsiderable land of jukea where only a few despised enfeebled tribes possessed the light of sa∣cred knowledge what a spectacle for the father of the universe who produced a world to know him and be happy how much must his divine compassion be excited on contem∣plating his glorious work in ruins—to redeem it was an effort worthy of himself we now come to the enlightened ages of greece and rome—a period when i fancy i see the human soul like a brilliant page   0  gem illustrious in the dust what noble struggles did then the human reason make to free itself from the incumbent load or darkness and error then lived those nu∣merous worthies whose names are yet precious to posterity what greatness of soul—what a taste for solid glory—what elevated sentiments did they not disco∣ver yet these men so far superior to the rest of their species acknowledged a mul∣tiplicity of deities whose moral charac∣ters were infinitely inferior to their own and to whom they scrupled not to ascribe actions which themselves would have blush∣ed to acknowledge every passion of the human mind was personified and deified statues graced every corner of their streets yet were there not wanting some among them who made bold advances in search of better informatiòn—like benighted tra∣vellers they followed the most distant gleam of light yet all they could obtain was doubt and obscurity page   0  at this period when reason had done all it could do to regain its native rights and privileges—the saviour of the world appeared at whose sacred presence idola∣try fled and the knowledge of the one true god began to enlighten mankind they were no longer compelled to en∣quire where is god our maker they knew him and were instructed in his di∣vine worship the doctrines which the divine messiah taught eminently tended to restore human nature to the rectitude and happiness it had lost—they were calcula∣ted to harmonize the passions regulate the affections and exalt the soul to a sense of her own dignity by revealing in the clear∣est terms the immortality of her nature—a point which philosophy had long sought to explore through the dim veil of pro∣bable conjecture a cursory view of the tenets of christi∣anity is sufficient to evince that they are designed to establish the happiness of man∣kind page   0  even in the present life consider the benevolence and charity they incul∣cate—the patience meekness moderation contempt of worldly pleasures and enjoy∣ments the generous clemency to ene∣mies with the rest of that bright assem∣blage of virtues they enjoin and you will confess it a matter of wonder that the felicity of eden is not already restored to those countries where the religion of christ is professed—and the reason it is not so can be none other than that of the thou∣sands who daily make profession of it so few have a competent knowledge of its na∣ture and design born in a christian land they think such a scrutiny superfluous thus they call themselves christians with∣out having any thing of the spirit of christ —and thus the human race is still ob∣noxious to a thousand miseries for want of applying to themselves the remedy which alone could put an end to moral evil page   0  may you my dear girls be effectually convinced of the inestimable value of this divine dispensation and think with dr young that a christian is the highest style of man  there are no virtuous dispositions—no generous affections—no truly noble sentiments that are not comprised in that sublime character possess it my young friends for no higher distinction or grea∣ter felicity can possibly be wished you by cornelia
