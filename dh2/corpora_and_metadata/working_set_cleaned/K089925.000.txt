company at home to prevent all misfortunes she has her breeding within doors the parson of the parish teaches her to play upon the dulcimer the clerk to sing her nurse to dress and her father to dance  in short nobody has free admission there but our old acquaintance mother coupler who has procured your brother this match and is i believe a distant relation of sir tunbellys   y fashion but is her fortune so considerable   townly three thousand a year and a good sum of money independent of her father beside   y fashion sdeath that my old acquaintance dame coupler could not have thought of me as

meet the lady you mention but she failing in her promise i partly from pique and partly from idleness have been diverting my chagrin by offering up chaste incense to the beauties of amanda our friend lovelesss wife   y fashion i have never seen her but have heard her spoken of as a youthful wonder of beauty and prudence   townly she is so indeed and loveless being too careless and insensible of the treasure he possesses  my lodging in the same house has given me a thousand opportunities of making my assiduities acceptable so that in less than a fortnight i began to bear my disappointment from the widow with the most christian resignation   y fashion and berinthia has never appeared   townly o there is the perplexity for just as i began not to care whether i ever saw her again or not last night she arrived   y fashion and instantly reassumed her empire   townly no faith  we met  but the lady not condescending to giev me any serious reasons for having fooled me for a month i left her in a huff   y fashion well well i will answer for it she will soon resume her power especially as friendship will prevent your pursuing the other too far  but my coxcomb of a brother is an admirer of amandas too is he   townly yes and i believe is most heartily despised by her  but come with me and you shall see her and your old friend loveless   y fashion i must pay my respects to his lordship  perhaps you can direct me to his lodgings   townly come with me i shall pass by it   y fashion i wish you could pay the visit for me or could tell me what i should say to him   townly say nothing to him  apply yourself to his bag his sword his feather his snuff box and when you are well with them desire him to lend you a thousand pounds and i will engage you prosper   y fashion sdeath and furies

let the next be the thickness of a crown piece less   mendlegs indeed my lord they are the same kind i had the honor to furnish your lordship with in town   ld foppington very possibly mr mendlegs but that was in the beginning of the winter and you should always remember mr hosier that if you make a noblemans spring legs as robust as his autumnal calves you commit a manstrous impropriety and make no allowance for the fatigues of the winter   jew i hope my lord those buckles have had the unspeakable satisfaction of being honored with your lordships approbation   ld foppington why they are of a pretty fancy but dont you think them rather of the smallest   jew my lord they could not well be larger to keep on your lordships shoe   ld foppington my good sir you forget that these matters are not as they used to be formerly indeed the buckle was a sort of machine intended to keep on the shoe but the case is now quite reversed and the shoe is of no earthly use but to keep on the buckle  now give me my watches and the business of the morning will be pretty well over   y fashion well lory what do think on it  a very friendly reception from a brother after three years absence   lory why sir

coupler coupler soh i am likely to be well rewarded for my services truly my suspicions i find were but too just  what refuse to advance me a paltry sum when i am upon the point of making him master

good   coupler he has given me a bond of a thousand pounds for helping him to his fortune and has promised me as much more in ready money upon the day of the marriage which i understand by a friend he never designs to pay me and his just now refusing to pay me a part is a proof of it if therefore you will be a generous young rogue and secure me five thousand pounds i will help you to the lady   y fashion and how the devil will thou do that   coupler without the devils aid i warrant thee thy brothers face not one of the family ever saw the whole business has been managed by me and all the letters go through my hands sir tunbelly clumsey my relation for that is the old gentlemans name is apprized of his lordships being down here and expects him tomorrow to receive his daughters hand but the peer i find means to bait here a few days longer to recover the fatigue of his journey i suppose now you shall go to muddymoathall in this place i will give you a letter of introduction and if you dont marry the girl before sunset you deserve to be hanged before morning   y fashion agreed agreed and for thy reward    coupler well well  though i warrant thou have not a farthing of money in thy pocket now  no  one may see it in thy face   y fashion not a souse by jupiter   coupler must i advance then  well be at my lodgings next door this evening and i will see what may be done  well sign

be great people   lory aye sir if the devil dont step between the cup and the lip as he uses to do   y fashion why faith he has played me many a damned trick to spoil my fortune and egad i am almost afraid he is at work about it again now but if i should tell thee how thou would wonder at me   lory indeed sir i should not   y fashion how do know   lory because sir i have wondered at you so often i can wonder at you no more   y fashion no what would thou say if a qualm of conscience should spoil my design   lory i would eat my words and wonder more than ever   y fashion why faith lory though i am a young rakehell and have played many a rogueish trick this is so fullgrown a cheat i find i must take pains to come up to it  i have scruples   lory they are strong symptoms of death if you find they increase sir pray make your will   y fashion no my conscience shall not starve me neither but thus far i will listen to it before i execute this project i will try my brother to the bottom if he has yet so much humanity about him as to assist me though with a moderate aid i will drop my project at his feet and show him how i can do for him much more than what i would ask he would do for me this one conclusive trial of him i resolve to make   succeed or fail still victorys my lot if i subdue his heart it is well  if not i will subdue my conscience to my plot exeunt end of the first act act ii scene i enter loveless and amanda loveless how do you like these lodgings my dear for my part i am so well pleased with them i shall hardly remove whilst we stay here if you are satisfied   amanda i am satisfied with every thing that pleases you else i had not come to scarbro at all   loveless o a little of the noise and folly of this place will sweeten the pleasures of our retreat we shall find the charms of our retirement doubled when we return to it   amanda that pleasing prospect will be my chiefest entertainment whilst much against my will i engage in those empty pleasures which it is so much the fashion to be fond of   loveless i own most of them are indeed but empty yet there are delights of which a private life is destitute which may divert an honest man and be a harmless entertainment to a virtuous woman good music is one and truly with some small allowance the plays i think may be esteemed another   amanda plays i must confess have some small charms and would have more would they restrain that loose encouragement to vice which shocks if not the virtue of some women at least the modesty of all   loveless but till that reformation can be wholly made twould surely be a pity to exclude the productions of some of our best writers for want of a little wholesome pruning which might be effected by any one who possessed modesty enough to believe that we should preserve all we can of our deceased authors at least till they are outdone by the living ones   amanda what do you think of that you saw last night   loveless to say truth i did not mind it much my attention was for some time taken off to admire the workmanship of nature in the face of a young lady who sat some distance from me she was so exquisitely handsome   amanda so exquisitely handsome   loveless why do you repeat my words my dear   amanda because you seemed to speak them with such pleasure i thought i might oblige you with their echo   loveless then you are alarmed amanda   amanda it is my duty to be so when you are in danger   loveless you are too quick in apprehending for me i viewed her with a world of admiration but not one glance of love   amanda take heed of trusting to such nice distinctions but were your eyes the only things that were inquisitive had i been in your place my tongue i fancy had been curious too i should have asked her where she lived yet still without design who was she pray   loveless indeed i cannot tell   amanda you will not tell   loveless by all that is sacred then i did not ask   amanda nor do you know what company was with her   loveless i do not but why are you so earnest   amanda i thought i had cause   loveless but you thought wrong amanda for turn the case and let it be your story should you come home and tell me you had seen a handsome man should i grow jealous because you had eyes   amanda but should i tell you he was exquisitely so and that i had gazed on him with admiration should you not think twere possible i might go one step further and enquire his name   loveless  aside she has reason on her side i have talked too much but i must turn off another way  to her will you then make no difference amanda between the language of our sex and yours there is a modesty restrains your tongues which makes you speak by halves when you commend but roving flattery gives a loose to ours which makes us still speak double what we think you should not therefore in so strict a sense take what i said to her advantage   amanda those flights of flattery sir are to our faces only when women are once out of hearing you are as modest in your commendations as we are but i shall not put you to the trouble of farther excuses  if you please this business shall rest here only give me leave to wish both for your peace and mine that you may never meet this miracle of beauty more   loveless i am content   enter servant servant madam there is a lady at the door in a chair desires to know whether your ladyship sees company her name is berinthia   amanda o dear  it is a relation i have not seen these five years pray her to walk in  exit serve here is another beauty for you she was when i saw her last reckoned extremely handsome   loveless dont be jealous now for i shall gaze upon her too   enter berinthia loveless  aside ha  by heavens the very woman   berinthia  saluting amanda dear amanda i did not expect to meet with you in scarbro   amanda sweet cousin i am overjoyed to see you  to lov mr loveless here is a relation and a friend of mine i desire you will be better acquainted with   loveless  saluting berinthia if my wife never desires a harder thing madam her request will be easily granted   enter servant servant sir my lord foppington presents his humble service to you and desires to know how you do he is at the next door and if it be not inconvenient to you he will come and wait upon you   loveless give my compliments to his lordship and i shall be glad to see him  exit serve if you are not acquainted with his lordship madam you will be entertained with his character   amanda now it moves my pity more than my mirth to see a man whom nature has made no sool be so very industrious to pass for an ass   loveless no there you are wrong amanda you should never bestow your pity upon those who take pains for your contempt pity those whom nature abuses never those who abuse nature   enter lord foppington ld foppington dear loveless i am your most humble servant   loveless my lord i am yours   ld foppington madam your ladyships very humble slave   loveless my lord this lady is a relation of my wifes   ld foppington  saluting her the beautifullest race of people upon earth rat me dear loveless i am overjoyed that you think of continuing here i am stap my vitals  to amanda for gads sake madam how has your ladyship been able to subsist thus long under the fatigue of a country life   amanda my life has been very far from that my lord it has been a very quiet one   ld foppington why that is the fatigue i speak of madam for it is impossible to be quiet without thinking now thinking is to me the greatest fatigue in the world   amanda does not your lordship love reading then   ld foppington oh passionately madam but i never think of what i read   berinthia why can your lordship read without thinking   ld foppington o lard can your ladyship pray without devotion madam   amanda well i must own i think books the best entertainment in the world   ld foppington i am so much of your ladyships mind madam that i have a private gallery in town where i walk sometimes which is furnished with nothing but books and looking glasses madam i have gilded them and ranged them so prettily before gad it is the most entertaining thing in the world to walk and look at them   amanda nay i love a neat library too but it is i think the inside of a book should recommend it most to us   ld foppington that i must confess i am not altogether so fand of far to my mind the inside of a book is to entertain ones self with the forced product of another mans brain now i think a man of quality and breeding may be much more diverted with the natural sprauts of his own but to say the truth madam let a man love reading never so well when once he comes to know the tawn he finds so many better ways of passing away the fourandtwenty hours that it were ten thousand pities he should consume his time in that far example madam now my life my life madam is a perpetual stream of pleasure that glides through with such a variety of entertainments i believe the wisest of our ancestors never had the least conception of any of em i rise madam when in town about twelve oclock i dont rise sooner because it is the worst thing in the world for the complexion not that i pretend to be a beau but a man must endeavor to look decent lest he makes so odious a figure in the sidebax the ladies should be compelled to turn their eyes upon the play so at twelve oclock i say i rise naw if i find it a good day i resalve to take the exercise of riding so drink my chocolate and draw on my boots by two on my return i dress and after dinner lounge perhaps to the opera   berinthia your lordship i suppose is fond of music   ld foppington o passionately on tuesdays and saturdays provided there is good company and one is not expected to undergo the fatigue of listening   amanda does your lordship think that the case at the opera   ld foppington most certainly madam there is my lady tattle my lady prate my lady titter my lady sneer my lady giggle and my lady grin  these have boxes in the front and while any favorite air is singing are the prettiest company in the waurld stap my vitals may not we hope for the honor to see you added to our society madam   amanda alas my lord i am the worst company in the world at a concert i am so apt to attend to the music   ld foppington why madam that is very pardonable in the country or at church but a monstrous inattention in a polite assembly but i am afraid i tire the company   loveless not at all pray go on   ld foppington why then ladies there only remains to add that i generally conclude the evening at one or other of the clubs not that i ever play deep indeed i have been for some time tied up from losing above five thousand pawnds at a sitting   loveless but isnt your lordship sometimes obliged to attend the weighty affairs of the nation   ld foppington sir as to weighty affairs i leave them to weighty heads i never intend mine shall be a burden to my body   berinthia nay my lord but you are a pillar of the state   ld foppington an ornamental pillar madam for sooner than undergo any part of the burden rat me but the whole building should fall to the ground   amanda but my lord a fine gentleman spends a great deal of his time in his intrigues you have given us no account of them yet   ld foppington  aside soh she would enquire into my amors that is jealousy poor soul i see she is in love with me  to her why madam i should have mentioned my intrigues but i am really afraid i begin to be troublesome with the length of my visit   amanda your lordship is too entertaining to grow troublesome any where   ld foppington  aside that now was as much as if she had said pray make love to me i will let her see i am quick of apprehension  to her o lard madam i had like to have forgot a secret i must needs tell your ladyship  to lov ned you must not be so jealous now as to listen   loveless not i my lord i am too fashionable a husband to pry into the secrets of my wife   ld foppington  to aman squeezing her hand i am in love with you to desperation strike me speechless   amanda  giving him a box of the ear then thus i return your passion  an impudent fool   ld foppington gads curse madam i am a peer of the realm   loveless hey what the devil do you affront my wife sir nay then   draws and fight   amanda ah what has my folly done  help murder help part them for heavens sake   ld foppington  falling back and leaning on his sword ah quite through the body stap my vitals   enter servants loveless  running to him i hope i have not killed the fool however  bear him up  where is your wound   ld foppington just through the guts   loveless call a surgeon there  unbutton him quickly   ld foppington ay pray make haste   loveless this mischief you may thank yourself for   ld foppington i may

to find you all alive  i met a wounded peer carrying off  for heavens sake what was the matter   loveless o a trifle  he would have made love to my wife before my face so she obliged him with a box of the ear and i run him through the body that was all   townly bagatelle on all sides  but pray madam how long has this noble lord been an humble servant of yours   amanda this is the first i have heard on it  so i suppose it is his quality more than his love has brought him into this adventure he thinks his title an authentic passport to every womans heart below the degree of a peeress   townly he is coxcomb enough to think any thing but i would not have you brought into trouble for him  i hope there is no danger of his life   loveless none at all  he is fallen into the hands of a roguish surgeon who i perceive designs to frighten a little money out of him  but i saw his wound  it is nothing  he may go to the ball tonight if he pleases   townly i am glad you have corrected him without farther mischief or you might have deprived me of the pleasure of executing a plot against his lordship which i have been contriving with an old acquaintance of yours   loveless explain    townly his brother tom fashion is come down here and we have it in contemplation to save him the trouble of his intended wedding but we want your assistance tom would have called but he is preparing for his enterprise so i promised to bring you to him  so sir if these ladies can spare you    loveless i will go with you with all my heart   aside  though i could wish methinks to stay and gaze a little longer on that creature  good gods how engaging she is  but what have i to do with beauty  i have already had my portion and must not covet more   to townly come sir when you please   townly ladies

you like my cousin here   loveless jealous already amanda   amanda not at all  i ask you for another reason   loveless  aside whatever her reason be i must not tell her true  to her why i confess she is handsome  but you must not think i slight your kinswoman if i own to you of all the women who may claim that character she is the last would triumph in my heart   amanda i am satisfied   loveless now tell me why you asked   amanda at night i will  adieu    loveless  kissing her i am yours   exit   amanda  aside i am glad to find he does not like her for i have a great mind to persuade her to come and live with me   berinthia  aside soh i find my colonel continues in his airs there must be something more at the bottom of this than the provocation he pretends from me   amanda for heavens sake berinthia tell me what way i shall take to persuade you to come and live with me   berinthia why one way in the world there is  and but one   amanda and pray what is that   berinthia it is to assure me  i shall be very welcome   amanda if that be all you shall even sleep here tonight   berinthia tonight   amanda yes tonight   berinthia why the people where i lodge will think me mad   amanda let em think what they please   berinthia say you so amanda  why then they shall think what they please  for i am a young widow and i care not what any body thinks  ah amanda it is a delicious thing to be a young widow   amanda you will hardly make me think so   berinthia puh because you are in love with your husband  but that is not every womans case   amanda i hope twas yours at least   berinthia mine say you  now i have a great mind to tell you a lie but i shall do it so aukwardly you would find me out   amanda then even speak the truth   berinthia shall i  then after all i did love him amanda as a nun does penance   amanda how did you live together   berinthia like man and wife  asunder  he loved the country  i the town  he hawks and hounds  i coaches and equipage  he eating and drinking  i carding and playing  he the sound of a horn  i the squeek of a fiddle  we were dull company at table  worse abed whenever we met we gave one another the spleen and never agreed but once which was about lying alone   amanda but tell me one thing truly and sincerely  notwithstanding all these jars did not his death at last extremely trouble you   berinthia o yes  i was forced to wear an odious widows band a twelvemonth for it   amanda women i find have different inclinations  prithee berinthia instruct me a little farther  for i am so great a novice i am almost ashamed on it  not heaven knows that what you call intrigues have any charms for me  the practical part of all unlawful love is    berinthia o it is abominable  but for the speculative that we must all confess is entertaining enough   amanda pray be so just then to me to believe it is with a world of innocence i would enquire whether you think those we call women of reputation do really escape all other men as they do those shadows of beaus   berinthia o no amanda  there are a sort of men make dreadful work amongst em  men that may be called the beaus antipathy  for they agree in nothing but walking upon two legs these have brains  the beau has none  these are in love with their mistress  the beau with himself  they take care of their reputation  he is industrious to destroy it  they are decent  he is a fop they are men  he is an ass   amanda if this be their character i fancy we had here even now a pattern of em both   berinthia his lordship and colonel townly   amanda the same   berinthia as for the lord he is eminently so and for the other i can assure you there is not a man in town who has a better interest with the women that are worth having an interest with   amanda he answers then the opinion i had ever of him  heavens what a difference there is between a man like him and that vain nauseous fop lord foppington   taking her hand i must acquaint you with a secret cousin  it is not that fool alone has talked to me of love  townly has been tampering too   berinthia  aside so so  here the mystery comes out  colonel townly  impossible my dear   amanda it is true indeed  though he has done it in vain nor do i think that all the merit of mankind combined could shake the tender love i bear my husband yet i will own to you berinthia i did not start at his addresses as when they came from one whom i contemned   berinthia  aside o this is better and better  well said innocence  and you really think my dear that nothing could abate your constancy and attachment to your husband   amanda nothing i am convinced   berinthia what if you found he loved another woman better   amanda well   berinthia well  why were i that thing they call a slighted wife somebody should run the risk of being that thing they call  a husband   amanda o fie berinthia no revenge should ever be taken against a husband  but to wrong his bed is a vengeance which of all vengeance    berinthia is the sweetest  ha ha ha i  dont i talk madly   amanda madly indeed   berinthia yet i am very innocent   amanda that i dare swear you are  i know how to make allowances for your humor  but you resolve then never to marry again   berinthia o no  i resolve i will   amanda how so   berinthia that i never may   amanda you banter me   berinthia indeed i dont  but i consider i am a woman and form my resolutions accordingly   amanda well my opinion is form what resolution you will matrimony will be the end on it   berinthia i doubt it  but a heavens  i have business at home and am half an hour too late   amanda as you are to return with me i will just give some orders and walk with you   berinthia well make haste and well finish this subject as we go  exit amanda  ah poor amanda you have led a country life well this discovery is lucky  base townly  at once false to me and treacherous to his friend and my innocent demure cousin too  i have it in my power to be revenged on her however her husband if i have any skill in countenance would be as happy in my smiles as townly can hope to be in here is  i will make the experiment come what will on it  the woman who can forgive the being

undertake to prescribe you a cure   loveless alas you undertake you know not what   berinthia so far at least then you allow me to be a physician   loveless nay i will allow you to be so yet farther for i have reason to believe should i put myself into your hands you would increase my distemper   berinthia how   loveless oh you might betray my complaints to my wife   berinthia and so lose all my practice   loveless will you then keep my secret   berinthia i will   loveless i am satisfied now hear my symptoms and give me your advice the first were these when i saw you at the play a random glance you threw at first alarmed me i could not turn my eyes from whence the danger came  i gazed upon you till my heart began to pant  nay even now on your approaching me my illness is so increased that if you do not help me i shall whilst you look on consume to ashes  taking her hand   berinthia  breaking from him o lord let me go it is the plague and we shall be infected   loveless then well

indifference in excusing herself to me  o rare woman  well then let loveless look to his wife twill be but the retort courteous on both sides   to berinthia your servant madam i need not ask you how you do you have got so good a color   berinthia no better than i used to have i suppose   townly a little more blood in your cheeks   berinthia i have been walking   townly is that all pray was it mr loveless went from here just now   berinthia o yes  he has been walking with me   townly he has   berinthia upon my word i think he is a very agreeable man  and there is certainly something particularly insinuating in his address   townly so so she has nt even the modesty to dissemble pray madam may i without impertinence trouble you with a few serious questions   berinthia as many as you please but pray let them be as little serious as possible   townly is it not near two years since i have presumed to address you   berinthia i dont know exactly  but it has been a tedious long time   townly have i not during that period had every reason to believe that my assiduities were far from being unacceptable   berinthia why to do you justice you have been extremely troublesome  and i confess i have been more civil to you than you deserved   townly did i not come to this place at your express desire and for no purpose but the honor of meeting you  and after wasting a month in disappointment have you condescended to explain or in the slightest way apologize for your conduct   berinthia o heavens apologize for my conduct  apologize to you  o you barbarian  but pray now my good serious colonel have you any thing more to add   townly nothing madam but that after such behavior i am less surprised at what i saw just now it is not very wonderful that the woman who can trifle with the delicate addresses of an honorable lover should be found coquetting with the husband of her friend   berinthia very true  no more wonderful than it was for this honorable lover to divert himself in the absence of this coquet with endeavoring to seduce his friends wife o colonel colonel dont talk of honor or your friend for heavens sake   townly gods death how came she to suspect this  really madam i dont understand you   berinthia nay  nay  you saw i did not pretend to misunderstand you  but here comes the lady  perhaps you would be glad to be left with her for an explanation   townly o madam this recrimination is a poor resource and to convince you how much you are mistaken i beg leave to decline the happiness you propose me  madam your servant   enter amanda townly whispers amanda and exit berinthia he carries it off well however  upon my word  very well  how tenderly they part  so cousin  i hope you have not been chiding your admirer for being with me  i assure you we have been talking of you   amanda fie berinthia  my admirer  will you never learn to talk in earnest of any thing   berinthia why this shall be in earnest if you please for my part i only tell you matter of fact   amanda i am sure there is so much jest and earnest in what you say to me on this subject i scarce know how to take it  i have just parted with mr loveless  perhaps it is my fancy but i think there is an alteration in his manner which alarms me   berinthia and so you are jealous is that all   amanda that all  is jealousy then nothing   berinthia it should be nothing if i were in your case   amanda why what would you do   berinthia i would cure myself   amanda how   berinthia care as little for my husband as he did for me look you amanda you may build castles in the air and fume and fret and grow thin and lean and pale and ugly if you please but i tell you no man worth having is true to his wife or ever was or ever will be so   amanda do you then really think he is false to me for i did not suspect him   berinthia think so  i am sure of it   amanda you are sure on it   berinthia positively  he fell in love at the play   amanda right  the very same  but who could have told you this   berinthia um  o  townly  i suppose your husband has made him his confidant   amanda o base loveless  and what did townly say on it   berinthia so so  why should she ask that   aside  say  why he abused loveless extremely and said all the tender things of you in the world   amanda did he  oh my heart  i am very ill  i must go to the chamber  dear berinthia dont leave me a moment  exit   berinthia no  dont fear  so  there is certainly some affection on her side at least toward townly if it prove so and her agreeable husband perseveres  heaven send me resolution  well

would i were any thing but what i am  a base ungrateful man to use me thus   berinthia what has he given you fresh reason to suspect his wandering   amanda every hour gives me reason   berinthia and yet amanda you perhaps at this moment cause in anothers breast the same tormenting doubts and jealousies which you feel so sensibly yourself   amanda heaven knows i would not   berinthia why you cannot tell but there may be some one as tenderly attached to townly whom you boast of as your conquest as you can be to your husband   amanda i am sure i never encouraged his pretensions   berinthia pshaw pshaw  no sensible man ever perseveres to love without encouragement why have you not treated him as you have lord foppington   amanda because he has not presumed so far but let us drop the subject men not women are riddles mr loveless now follows some flirt for variety whom i am sure he does not like so well as he does me   berinthia that is more than you know madam   amanda why do you know the ugly thing   berinthia i think i can guess at the person  but she is no such ugly thing neither   amanda is she very handsome   berinnhia truly i think so   amanda whatever she be i am sure he does not like her well enough to bestow any thing more than a little outward gallantry upon her   berinthia  aside outward gallantry  i cannot bear this  come come dont you be too secure amanda while you suffer townly to imagine that you do not detest him for his designs on you you have no right to complain that your husband is engaged elsewhere but here comes the person we were speaking of   enter townly townly ladies as i come uninvited i beg if i intrude you will use the same freedom in turning me out again   amanda i believe sir it is near the time mr loveless said he would be at home he talked of accepting of lord foppingtons invitation to sup at sir tunbelly clumseys   townly his lordship has done me the honor to invite me also if you will let me escort you i will let you into a mystery as me go in which you must play a part when we arrive   amanda but we have two hours yet to spare  the carriages are not ordered till eight  and it is not a five minutes drive so cousin let us

heard berinthia tell my wife she had some particular letters to write this evening before we went to sir tunbellys and here are the implements for correspondence  how shall i muster up assurance to show myself when she comes  i think she has given me encouragement  and to do my impudence justice i have made the most of it  i hear a door open and some one coming if it should be my wife what the devil should i say  i believe she mistrusts me and by my life i dont deserve her tenderness however i am determined to reform though not yet hah  berinthia  so i will step in here till i see what sort of humor she is in goes into the closet   enter berinthia berinthia was ever so provoking a situation  to think i should sit and hear him compliment amanda to my face  i have lost all patience with

at your assurance   loveless why then you wonder before i have given you a proof of it but where is my wife   berinthia at cards   loveless with whom   berinthia with townly   loveless then we are safe enough   berinthia you are so  some husbands would be of another mind were he at cards with their wives   loveless and they would be in the right on it too  but i dare trust mine   berinthia indeed  and she i doubt not has the same confidence in you yet do you think she would be content to come and find you here   loveless egad as you say that is true  then for fear she should come had not we better go into the next room out of her way   berinthia what  in the dark   loveless aye  or with a light which you please   berinthia you are certainly very impudent   loveless nay then  let me conduct you my angel   berinthia hold hold you are mistaken in your angel i assure you   loveless i hope not for by this hand i swear   berinthia come come let go my hand or i shall hate you i will cry out as i live   loveless impossible  you cannot be so cruel   berinthia ha  here is some one coming  be gone instantly   loveless will you promise to return if i remain here   berinthia never trust myself in a room with you again while i live   loveless but i have something particular to communicate to you   berinthia well well before we go to sir tunbellys i will walk upon the lawn if you are fond of a moonlight evening you will find me there   loveless efaith they are coming here now  i take you at your word  exit loveless into the closet   berinthia it is amanda as i live  i hope she has not hheard s voice though i mean she should have er share of jealousy in turn   enter amanda amanda berinthia why did you leave me   berinthia i thought i only spoiled your party   amanda since you have been gone townly has attempted to renew his importunities  i must break with him  for i cannot venture to acquaint mr loveless with his conduct   berinthia o no  mr loveless mustnt know of it by any means   amanda o not for the world  i wish berinthia you would undertake to speak to townly on the subject   berinthia upon my word it would be a very pleasant subject for me to talk to him on  but come  let us go back  and you may depend on it i will not leave you together again if i can help it  exeunt enter loveless loveless soh  so  a pretty piece of business i have overheard  townly makes love to my wife  and i am not to know it for the world  i must enquire into this  and by heaven if i find that amanda has in the smallest degree  yet what have i been at here  o gods death that is no rule  that wife alone unsullied credit wins whose virtues can atone her husbands sins thus while the man has other nymphs in view it suits the woman to be doubly true exit end of the fourth act act v scene i a garden  moonlight enter loveless loveless now does she mean to make a fool of me or not  i shall not wait much longer for my wife will soon be enquiring for me to set out on our supping party  suspense is at all times the devil  but of all modes of suspense the watching for a loitering mistress is the worst  but let me accuse her no longer  she approaches with one smile to oerpay the anxiety of a year   enter berinthia berinthia o berinthia what a world of kindness are you in my debt  had you staid five minutes longer    berinthia you would have been gone i suppose   loveless  aside egad she is right enough   berinthia and i assure you twas ten to one that i came at all in short i begin to think you are too dangerous a being to trifle with and as i shall probably only make a fool of you at last i believe we had better let matters rest as they are   loveless you cannot mean it sure   berinthia no  why do you think you are really so irresistible and master of so much address as to deprive a woman of her senses in a few days acquaintance   loveless o no madam it is only by your preserving your senses that i can hope to be admitted into your favor  your taste judgment and discernment are what i build my hopes on   berinthia very modest upon my word  and it certainly follows that the greatest proof i can give of my possessing those qualities would be my admiring mr loveless   loveless o that were so cold a proof    berinthia what shall i do more  esteem you   loveless o no  worse and worse  can you behold a man whose every faculty your attractions have engrossed  whose whole soul as by enchantment you have seized on  can you see him tremble at your feet and talk of so poor a return as your esteem   berinthia what more would you have me give to a married man   loveless how doubly cruel to remind me of misfortunes   berinthia a misfortune to be married to so charming a woman as amanda   loveless i grant all her merit but  sdeath now see what you have done by talking of her  she is here by all that is unlucky   berinthia o ged we had both better get out of the way for i should feel as awkward to meet her as you   loveless aye  but if i mistake not i see townly coming this way also  i must see a little into this matter  steps aside   berinthia o if that is your intention  i am no woman if suffer myself to be outdone in curiosity  goes on the other side   enter amanda amanda mr loveless come home and walking on the awn  i will not suffer him to walk so late though perhaps it is to show his neglect of me  mr loveless  ha  townly again  how i am persecuted   enter townly townly madam you seem disturbed   amanda sir i have reason   townly whatever be the cause i would to heaven it were in my power to bear the pain or to remove the malady   amanda your interference can only add to my distress   townly ah madam if it be the sting of unrequited love you suffer from seek for your remedy in revenge  weigh well the strength and beauty of your charms and rouse up that spirit a woman ought to bear  disdain the false embraces of a husband  see at your feet a real lover  his zeal may give him title to your pity although his merit cannot claim your love   loveless  aside so so very fine efaith   amanda why do you presume to talk to me thus  is this your friendship to mr loveless  i perceive you will compel me at last to acquaint him with your treachery   townly he could not upbraid me if you were  he deserves it from me  for he has not been more false to you than faithless to me   amanda to you   townly yes madam the lady for whom he now deserts those charms which he was never worthy of was mine by right and i imagined too by inclination  yes madam berinthia who now    amanda berinthia  impossible    townly it is true or may i never merit your attention  she is the deceitful sorceress who now holds your husbands heart in bondage   amanda i will not believe it   townly by the faith of a true lover i speak from conviction  this very day i saw them together and overheard    amanda peace sir i will not even listen to such slander  this is a poor device to work on my resentment to listen to your insidious addresses no sir though mr loveless may be capable of error i am convinced i cannot be deceived so grossly in him as to believe what you now report and for berinthia you should have fixed on some more probable person for my rival than she who is my relation and my friend for while i am myself free from guilt i will never believe that love can beget injury or confidence create ingratitude   townly if i do not prove this to you    amanda you never shall have an opportunity  from the artful manner in which you first showed yourself to me i might have been led as far as virtue permitted to have thought you less criminal than unhappy  but this last unmanly artifice merits at once my resentment and contempt exit   townly sure there is divinity about her and she has dispensed some portion of honors light to me yet can i bear to lose berinthia without revenge or compensation  perhaps she is not so culpable as i thought her i was mistaken when i began to think lightly of amandas virtue and may be in my censure of my berinthia  surely i love her still for i feel i should be happy to find myself in the wrong exit   enter loveless and berinthia berinthia your servant mr loveless   loveless your servant madam   berinthia pray what do you think of this   loveless truly i dont know what to say   berinthia dont you think we steal forth two contemptible creatures   loveless why tolerable  so i must confess   berinthia and do you conceive it possible for you ever to give amanda the least uneasiness again   loveless no i think we never should indeed   berinthia we  why monster you dont pretend that i ever entertained a thought   loveless why then sincerely and honestly berinthia there is something in my wifes conduct which strikes me so forcibly that if it were not for shame and the fear of hurting you in her opinion i swear i would follow her confess my error and trust to her generosity for forgiveness   berinthia nay prithee dont let your respect for me prevent you for as my object in trifling with you was nothing more than to pique townly and as i perceive he has been actuated by a similar motive you may depend on it i shall make no mystery of the matter to him   loveless by no means inform him  for though i may choose to pass by his conduct without resentment how will he presume to look me in the face again   berinthia how will you presume to look him in the face again   loveless he  who has dared to attempt the honor of my wife   berinthia you  who have dared to attempt the honor of his mistress  come come be ruled by me who affect more levity than i have and dont think of anger in this cause a readiness to resent injuries is a virtue only in those who are slow to injure   loveless then i will be ruled by you  and when you shall think proper to undeceive townly may your good qualities make as sincere a convert of him as amandas have of me when truths extended from us then we own the robe of virtue is a secret habit  could women but our secret counsels scan  could they but reach the deep reserve of man  to keep our love  they would rate their virtue high  they live together and together die exit scene sir tunbellys house enter miss
