horae paulinae or the truth of the scripture history of st paul evinced by a comparison of the epistles which bear his name with the acts of the apostles and with one another  by william paley m a archdeacon of carlisle  london printed by j davis for r faulder new bondstreet mdccxc  to the right reverend john law d d lord bishop of killalla and achonry as a testimony of esteem for his virtues and learning and of gratitude for the long and faithful friendship with which the author has been honored by him this attempt to confirm the evidence of the christian history is inscribed by his affectionate and most obliged servant  w paley  the truth of the scripture history of st paul evinced chap i exposition of the argument the volume of christian scriptures contains thirteen letters purporting to be written by st paul it contains also a book which amongst other things professes to deliver the history or rather memoirs of the history of this same person by assuming the genuineness of the letters we may prove the substantial truth of the history or by assuming the truth of the history we may argue strongly in support of the genuineness of the letters but i assume neither one nor the other the reader is at liberty to suppose these writings to have been lately discovered in the library of the escurial and to come to our hands destitute of any extrinsic or collateral evidence whatever and the argument i am about to offer is calculated to show that a comparison of the different writings would even under these circumstances afford good reason to believe the persons and transactions to have been real the letters authentic and the narration in the main to be true  agreement or conformity between letters bearing the name of an ancient author and a received history of that authors life does not necessarily establish the credit of either because    the history may like middletons life of cicero or jortins life of erasmus have been wholly or in part compiled from the letters in which case it is manifest that the history adds nothing to the evidence already afforded by the letters or    the letters may have been fabricated out of the history a species of imposture which is certainly practicable and which without any accession of proof or authority would necessarily produce the appearance of consistency and agreement or    the history and letters may have been founded upon some authority common to both as upon reports and traditions which prevailed in the age in which they were composed or upon some ancient record now lost which both writers consulted in which case also the letters without being genuine may exhibit marks of conformity with the history and the history without being true may agree with the letters  agreement therefore or conformity is only to be relied upon so far as we can exclude these several suppositions now the point to be noticed is that in the three cases above enumerated conformity must be the effect of design where the history is compiled from the letters which is the first case the design and composition of the work are in general so confessed or made so evident by comparison as to leave us in no danger of confounding the production with original history or of mistaking it for an independent authority the agreement it is probable will be close and uniform and will easily be perceived to result from the intention of the author and from the plan and conduct of his work  where the letters are fabricated from the history which is the second case it is always for the purpose of imposing a forgery upon the public and in order to give color and probability to the fraud names places and circumstances found in the history may be studiously introduced into the letters as well as a general consistency be endeavored to be maintained but here it is manifest that whatever congruity appears is the consequence of meditation artifice and design  the third case is that wherein the history and the letters without any direct privity or communication with each other derive their materials from the same source and by reason of their common original furnish instances of accordance and correspondency this is a situation in which we must allow it to be possible for ancient writings to be placed and it is a situation in which it is more difficult to distinguish spurious from genuine writings than in either of the cases described in the preceding suppositions inasmuch as the congruities observable are so far accidental as that they are not produced by the immediate transplanting of names and circumstances out of one writing into the other but although with respect to each other the agreement in these writings be mediate and secondary yet is it not properly or absolutely undesigned because with respect to the common original from which the information of the writers proceeds it is studied and factitious the case of which we treat must as to the letters be a case of forgery and when the writer who is personating another sits down to his composition  whether he have the history with which we now compare the letters or some other record before him or whether he have only loose tradition and reports to go by  he must adapt his imposture as well as he can to what he finds in these accounts and his adaptations will be the result of council scheme and industry art must be employed and vestiges will appear of management and design add to this that in most of the following examples the circumstances in which the coincidence is remarked are of too particular and domestic a nature to have floated down upon the stream of general tradition  of the three cases which we have stated the difference between the first and the two others is that in the first the design may be fair and honest in the others it must be accompanied with the consciousness of fraud but in all there is design in examining therefore the agreement between ancient writings the character of truth and originality is undesignedness and this test applies to every supposition for whether we suppose the history to be true but the letters spurious or the letters to be genuine but the history false or lastly falsehood to belong to both  the history to be a fable and the letters fictitious the same inference will result  that either there will be no agreement between them or the agreement will be the effect of design nor will it elude the principle of this rule to suppose the same person to have been the author of all the letters or even the author both of the letters and the history for no less design is necessary to produce coincidence between different parts of a mans own writings especially when they are made to take the different forms of a history and of original letters than to adjust them to the circumstances found in any other writing  with respect to those writings of the new testament which are to be the subject of our present consideration i think that as to the authenticity of the epistles this argument where it is sufficiently sustained by instances is nearly conclusive for i cannot assign a supposition of forgery in which coincidences of the kind we enquire after are likely to appear as to the history it extends to these points  it proves the general reality of the circumstances it proves the historians knowledge of these circumstances in the present instance it confirms his pretensions of having been a cotemporary and in the latter part of his history a companion of st paul in a word it establishes the substantial truth of the narration and substantial truth is that which in every historical enquiry ought to be the first thing sought after and ascertained it must be the ground work of every other observation  the reader then will please to remember this word undesignedness as denoting that upon which the construction and validity of our argument chiefly depend  as to the proofs of undesignedness i shall in this place say little for i had rather the readers persuasion should arise from the instances themselves and the separate remarks with which they may be accompanied than from any previous formulary or description of argument in a great plurality of examples i trust he will be perfectly convinced that no design or contrivance whatever has been exercised and if some of the coincidences alleged appear to be minute circuitous or oblique let him reflect that this very indirectness and subtility is that which gives force and propriety to the example broad obvious and explicit agreements prove little because it may be suggested that the insertion of such is the ordinary expedient of every forgery and though they may occur and probably will occur in genuine writings yet it cannot be proved that they are peculiar to these thus what st paul declares in chap xi of   cor concerning the institution of the eucharist  for i have received of the lord that which i also delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me  though it be in close and verbal conformity with the account of the same transaction preserved by st luke is yet a conformity of which no use can be made in our argument for if it should be objected that this was a mere recital from the gospel borrowed by the author of the epistle for the purpose of setting off his composition by an appearance of agreement with the received account of the lords supper i should not know how to repel the insinuation in like manner the description which st paul gives of himself in his epistle to the philippians iii    circumcised the eighth day of the stock of israel of the tribe of benjamin an hebrew of the hebrews as touching the law a pharisee concerning zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless  is made up of particulars so plainly delivered concerning him in the acts of the apostles the epistle to the romans and the epistle to the galatians that i cannot deny but that it would be easy for an impostor who was fabricating a letter in the name of st paul to collect these articles into one view this therefore is a conformity which we do not adduce but when i read in the acts of the apostles that when paul came to derbe and lystra behold a certain disciple was there named timotheus the son of a certain woman which was a jewess and when in an epistle addressed to timothy i find him reminded of his having known the holy scriptures from a child which implies that he must on one side or both have been brought up by jewish parents i conceive that i remark a coincidence which shows by its very obliquity that scheme was not employed in its formation in like manner if a coincidence depend upon a comparison of dates or rather of circumstances from which the dates are gathered  the more intricate that comparison shall be the more numerous the intermediate steps through which the conclusion is deduced in a word the more circuitous the investigation is the better because the agreement which finally results is thereby farther removed from the suspicion of contrivance affectation or design and it should be remembered concerning these coincidences that it is one thing to be minute and another to be precarious one thing to be unobserved and another to be obscure one thing to be circuitous or oblique and another to be forced dubious or fanciful and this distinction ought always to be retained in our thoughts  the very particularity of st pauls epistles the perpetual recurrence of names of persons and places the frequent allusions to the incidents of his private life and the circumstances of his condition and history and the connection and parallelism of those with the same circumstances in the acts of the apostles so as to enable us for the most part to confront them with one another as well as the relation which subsists between the circumstances as mentioned or referred to in the different epistles  afford no inconsiderable proof of the genuineness of the writings and the reality of the transactions for as no advertency is sufficient to guard against slips and contradictions when circumstances are multiplied and when they are liable to be detected by cotemporary accounts equally circumstantial an impostor i should expect would either have avoided particulars entirely contenting himself with doctrinal discussions moral precepts and general reflections this however must not be misunderstood a person writing to his friends and upon a subject in which the transactions of his own life were concerned would probably be led in the course of his letter especially if it was a long one to refer to passages found in his history a person addressing an epistle to the public at large or under the form of an epistle delivering a discourse upon some speculative argument would not it is probable meet with an occasion of alluding to the circumstances of his life at all he might or he might not the chance on either side is nearly equal this is the situation of the catholic epistle although therefore the presence of these allusions and agreements be a valuable accession to the arguments by which the authenticity of a letter is maintained yet the want of them certainly forms no positive objection  or if for the sake of imitating st pauls style he should have thought it necessary to intersperse his composition with names and circumstances he would have placed them out of the reach of comparison with the history and i am confirmed in this opinion by an inspection of two attempts to counterfeit st pauls epistles which have come down to us and the only attempts of which we have any knowledge that are at all deserving of regard one of these is an epistle to the laodiceans extant in latin and preserved by fabricius in his collection of apocryphal scriptures the other purports to be an epistle of st paul to the corinthians in answer to an epistle from the corinthians to him this was translated by scroderus from a copy in the armenian language which had been sent to w whiston and was afterward from a more perfect copy procured at aleppo published by his sons as an appendix to their edition of moses chorenensis no greek copy exists of either they are not only not supported by ancient testimony but they are negatived and excluded as they have never found admission into any catalogue of apostolical writings acknowledged by or known to the early ages of christianity in the first of these i found as i expected a total evitation of circumstances it is simply a collection of sentences from the canonical epistles strung together with very little skill the second which is a more versute and specious forgery is introduced with a list of names of persons who wrote to st paul from corinth and is preceded by an account sufficiently particular of the manner in which the epistle was sent from corinth to st paul and the answer returned but they are names which no one ever heard of and the account it is impossible to combine with any thing found in the acts or in the other epistles it is not necessary for me to point out the internal marks of spuriousness and imposture which these compositions betray but it was necessary to observe that they do not afford those coincidences which we propose as proofs of authenticity in the epistles which we defend  having explained the general scheme and formation of the argument i may be permitted to subjoin a brief account of the manner of conducting it  i have disposed the several instances of agreement under separate numbers as well to mark more sensibly the divisions of the subject as for another purpose viz that the reader may thereby be reminded that the instances are independent of one another i have advanced nothing which i did not think probable but the degree of probability by which different instances are supported is undoubtedly very different if the reader therefore meets with a number which contains an instance that appears to him unsatisfactory or founded in mistake he will dismiss that number from the argument but without prejudice to any other he will have occasion also to observe that the coincidences discoverable in some epistles are much fewer and weaker than what are supplied by others but he will add to his observation this important circumstance  that whatever ascertains the original of one epistle in some measure establishes the authority of the rest for whether these epistles be genuine or spurious every thing about them indicates that they come from the same hand the diction which it is extremely difficult to imitate preserves its resemblance and peculiarity throughout all the epistles numerous expressions and singularities of style found in no other part of the new testament are repeated in different epistles and occur in their respective places without the smallest appearance of force or art an involved argumentation frequent obscurities especially in the order and transition of thought piety vehemence affection bursts of rapture and of unparalleled sublimity are properties all or most of them discernible in every letter of the collection but although these epistles bear strong marks of proceeding from the same hand i think it is still more certain that they were originally separate publications they form no continued story they compose no regular correspondence they comprise not the transactions of any particular period they carry on no connection of argument they depend not upon one another except in one or two instances they refer not to one another i will farther undertake to say that no study or care has been employed to produce or preserve an appearance of consistency amongst them all which observations show that they were not intended by the person whoever he was that wrote them to come forth or be read together that they appeared at first separately and have been collected since  the proper purpose of the following work is to bring together from the acts of the apostles and from the different epistles such passages as furnish examples of undesigned coincidence but i have so far enlarged upon this plan as to take into it some circumstances found in the epistles which contributed strength to the conclusion though not strictly objects of comparison  it appeared also a part of the same plan to examine the difficulties which presented themselves in the course of our enquiry  i do not know that the subject has been proposed or considered in this view before ludovicus capellus bishop pearson dr benson and dr lardner have each given a continued history of st pauls life made up from the acts of the apostles and the epistles joined together but this it is manifest is a different undertaking from the present and directed to a different purpose  if what is here offered shall add one thread to that complication of probabilities by which the christian history is attested the readers attention will be repaid by the supreme importance of the subject and my design will be fully answered  chap ii the epistle to the romans no i the first passage i shall produce from this epistle and upon which a good deal of observation will be founded is the following  but now i go unto jerusalem to minister unto the saints for it has pleased them of macedonia and achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at jerusalem romans xv        in this quotation three distinct circumstances are stated  a contribution in macedonia for the relief of the christians of jerusalem a contribution in achaia for the same purpose and an intended journey of st paul to jerusalem these circumstances are stated as taking place at the same time and that to be the time when the epistle was written now let us enquire whether we can find these circumstances elsewhere and whether if we do find them they meet together in respect of date turn to the acts of the apostles chap xx ver     and you read the following account when he had gone over those parts viz macedonia and had given them much exhortation he came into greece and there abode three months and when the jews laid wait for him as he was about to sail into syria he purposed to return through macedonia from this passage compared with the account of st pauls travels given before and from the sequel of the chapter it appears that upon st pauls second visit to the peninsula of greece his intention was when he should leave the country to proceed from achaia directly by sea to syria but that to avoid the jews who were lying in wait to intercept him in his route he so far changed his purpose as to go back through macedonia embark at philippi and pursue his voyage from thence toward jerusalem here therefore is a journey to jerusalem but not a syllable of any contribution and as st paul had taken several journeys to jerusalem before and one also immediately after his first visit into the peninsula of greece acts xviii    it cannot from hence be collected in which of these visits the epistle was written or with certainty that it was written in either the silence of the historian who professes to have been with st paul at the time v   concerning any contribution might lead us to look out for some different journey or might induce us perhaps to question the consistency of the two records did not a very accidental reference in another part of the same history afford us sufficient ground to believe that this silence was omission when st paul made his reply before felix to the accusations of tertullus he alleged as was natural that neither the errand which brought him to jerusalem nor his conduct whilst he remained there merited the calumnies with which the jews had aspersed him now after many years i e of absence i came to bring alms to my nation and offerings whereupon certain jews from asia found me purified in the temple neither with multitude nor with tumult who ought to have been here before thee and object if they had ought against me acts xxiv      this mention of alms and offerings certainly brings the narrative in the acts nearer to an accordancy with the epistle yet no one i am persuaded will suspect that this clause was put into st pauls defense either to supply the omission in the preceding narrative or with any view to such accordancy  after all nothing is yet said or hinted concerning the place of the contribution nothing concerning macedonia and achaia turn therefore to the first epistle to the corinthians chap xvi ver    and you have st paul delivering the following directions concerning the collection for the saints as i have given orders to the churches of galatia even so do ye upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store as god has prospered him that there be no gatherings when i come and when i come whomsoever you shall approve by your letters them will i send to bring your liberality unto jerusalem and if it be meet that i go also they shall go with me in this passage we find a contribution carrying on at corinth the capital of achaia for the christians of jerusalem we find also a hint given of the possibility of st pauls going up to jerusalem himself after he had paid his visit into achaia but this is spoken of rather as a possibility than as any settled intention for his first thought was whomsoever you shall approve by your letters them will i send to bring your liberality to jerusalem and in the sixth verse he adds that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever i go this epistle purports to be written after st paul had been at corinth for it refers throughout to what he had done and said amongst them whilst he was there the expression therefore when i come must relate to a second visit against which visit the contribution spoken of was desired to be in readiness  but though the contribution in achaia be expressly mentioned nothing is here said concerning any contribution in macedonia turn therefore in the third place to the second epistle to the corinthians chap viii ver    and you will discover the particular which remains to be sought for moreover brethren we do you to wit of the grace of god bestowed on the churches of macedonia how that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality for to their power i bear record yea and beyond their power they were willing of themselves praying us with much entreaty that we would receive the gift and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints to which add chap ix ver   i know the forwardness of your mind for which i boast of you to them of macedonia that achaia was ready a year ago in this epistle we find st paul advanced as far as macedonia upon that second visit to corinth which he promised in his former epistle we find also in the passages now quoted from it that a contribution was going on in macedonia at the same time with or soon however following the contribution which was made in achaia but for whom the contribution was made does not appear in this epistle at all that information must be supplied from the first epistle  here therefore at length but fetched from three different writings we have obtained the several circumstances we enquired after and which the epistle to the romans brings together viz a contribution in achaia for the christians of jerusalem a contribution in macedonia for the same and an approaching journey of st paul to jerusalem we have these circumstances  each by some hint in the passage in which it is mentioned or by the date of the writing in which the passage occurs  fixed to a particular time and we have that time turning out upon examination to be in all the same namely toward the close of st pauls second visit to the peninsula of greece this is an instance of conformity beyond the possibility i will venture to say of random writing to produce i also assert that it is in the highest degree improbable that it should have been the effect of contrivance and design the imputation of design amounts to this that the forger of the epistle to the romans inserted in it the passage upon which our observations are founded for the purpose of giving color to his forgery by the appearance of conformity with other writings which were then extant i reply in the first place that if he did this to countenance his forgery he did it for the purpose of an argument which would not strike one reader in ten thousand coincidences so circuitous as this answer not the ends of forgery are seldom i believe attempted by it in the second place i observe that he must have had the acts of the apostles and the two epistles to the corinthians before him at the time in the acts of the apostles i mean that part of the acts which relates to this period he would have found the journey to jerusalem but nothing about the contribution in the first epistle to the corinthians he would have found a contribution going on in achaia for the christians of jerusalem and a distant hint of the possibility of the journey but nothing concerning a contribution in macedonia in the second epistle to the corinthians he would have found a contribution in macedonia accompanying that in achaia but no intimation for whom either was intended and not a word about the journey it was only by a close and attentive collation of the three writings that he could have picked out the circumstances which he has united in his epistle and by a still more nice examination that he could have determined them to belong to the same period in the third place i remark what diminishes very much the suspicion of fraud how aptly and connectedly the mention of the circumstances in question viz the journey to jerusalem and of the occasion of that journey arises from the context whenever i take my journey into spain i will come to you for i trust to see you in my journey and to be brought on my way thitherward by you if first i be somewhat filled with your company but now i go unto jerusalem to minister unto the saints for it has pleased them of macedonia and achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at jerusalem it has pleased them verily and their debtors they are for if the gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things when therefore i have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit i will come by you into spain is the passage in italics like a passage foisted in for an extraneous purpose does it not arise from what goes before by a junction as easy as any example of writing upon real business can furnish could any thing be more natural than that st paul in writing to the romans should speak of the time when he hoped to visit them should mention the business which then detained him and that he purposed to set forwards upon his journey to them when that business was completed  no ii by means of the quotation which formed the subject of the preceding number we collect that the epistle to the romans was written at the conclusion of st pauls second visit to the peninsula of greece but this we collect not from the epistle itself not from any thing declared concerning the time and place in any part of the epistle but from a comparison of circumstances referred to in the epistle with the order of events recorded in the acts and with references to the same circumstances though for quite different purposes in the two epistles to the corinthians now would the author of a forgery who sought to gain credit to a spurious letter by congruities depending upon the time and place in which the letter was supposed to be written have left that time and place to be made out in a manner so obscure and indirect as this is if therefore coincidences of circumstances can be pointed out in this epistle depending upon its date or the place where it was written whilst that date and place are only ascertained by other circumstances such coincidences may fairly be stated as undesigned under this head i adduce  chap xvi      timotheus my workfellow and lucius and jason and sosipater my kinsmen salute you i tertius who wrote this epistle salute you in the lord gaius mine host and of the whole church saluteth you and quartus a brother with this passage i compare acts xx   and there accompanied him into asia sopater of berea and of the thessalonians aristarchus and secundus and gaius of derbe and timotheus and of asia tychicus and trophimus the epistle to the romans we have seen was written just before st pauls departure from greece after his second visit to that peninsula the persons mentioned in the quotation from the acts are those who accompanied him in that very departure of seven whose names are joined in the salutation of the church of rome three viz sosipater gaius and timothy are proved by this passage in the acts to have been with st paul at the time and this is perhaps as much coincidence as could be expected from reality though less i am apt to think than would have been produced by design four are mentioned in the acts who are not joined in the salutation and it is in the nature of the case probable that there should be many attending st paul in greece who knew nothing of the converts at rome nor were known by them in like manner several are joined in the salutation who are not mentioned in the passage referred to in the acts this also was to be expected the occasion of mentioning them in the acts was their proceeding with st paul upon his journey but we may be sure that there were many eminent christians with st paul in greece besides those who accompanied him into asia of these jason is one whose presence upon this occasion is very naturally accounted for jason was an inhabitant of thessalonica in macedonia and entertained st paul in his house upon his first visit to that country acts xvii    st paul upon this his second visit passed through macedonia on his way to greece and from the situation of thessalonica most likely through that city it appears from various instances in the acts to have been the practice of many converts to attend st paul from place to place it is therefore highly probable i mean that it is highly consistent with the account in the history that jason according to that account a zealous disciple the inhabitant of a city at no great distance from greece and through which as it should seem st paul had lately passed should have accompanied st paul into greece and have been with him there at this time lucius is another name in the epistle a very slight alteration would convert  into  lucius into luke which would produce an additional coincidence for if luke was the author of the history he was with st paul at this time inasmuch as describing the voyage which took place soon after the writing of this epistle the historian uses the first person   we sailed away from philippi acts xx     but if any one shall still contend that a forger of the epistle with the acts of the apostles before him and having settled his scheme of writing a letter as from st paul upon his second visit into greece would casily think of the expedient of putting in the names of those persons who appeared to be with st paul at the time as an obvious recommendation of the imposture i then repeat my observations first that he would have made the catalogue more complete and secondly that with this contrivance in his thoughts it was certainly his business in order to avail himself of the artifice to have stated in the body of the epistle that st paul was in greece when he wrote it and that he was there upon his second visit neither of which he has done either directly or even so as to be discoverable by any circumstance found in the narrative delivered in the acts  under the same head viz of coincidences depending upon date i cite from the epistle the following salutation greet priscilla and aquila my helpers in christ jesus who have for my life laid down their own necks unto whom not only i give thanks but also all the churches of the gentiles chap xvi    it appears from the acts of the apostles that priscilla and aquila had originally been inhabitants of rome for we read acts xviii   that paul found a certain jew named aquila lately come from italy with his wife priscilla because that claudius had commanded all jews to depart from rome they were connected therefore with the place to which the salutations are sent that is one coincidence another is the following st paul became acquainted with these persons at corinth during his first visit into greece they accompanied him upon his return into asia were settled for some time at ephesus acts xviii      and appear to have been with st paul when he wrote from that place his first epistle to the corinthians   cor xvi    not long after the writing of which epistle st paul went from ephesus into macedonia and after he had gone over those parts proceeded from thence upon his second visit into greece during which visit or rather at the conclusion of it the epistle to the romans as has been shown was written we have therefore the time of st pauls residence at ephesus after he had written to the corinthians the time taken up by his progress through macedonia which is indefinite and was probably considerable and his three months abode in greece we have the sum of these three periods allowed for aquila and priscilla going back to rome so as to be there when the epistle before us was written now what this quotation leads us to observe is the danger of scattering names and circumstances in writings like the present how implicated they often are with dates and places and that nothing but truth can preserve consistency had the notes of time in the epistle to the romans fixed the writing of it to any date prior to st pauls first residence at corinth the salutation of aquila and priscilla would have contradicted the history because it would have been prior to his acquaintance with these persons if the notes of time had fixed it to any period during that residence at corinth during his journey to jerusalem when he first returned out of greece during his stay at antioch whither he went down from jerusalem or during his second progress through the lesser asia upon which he proceeded from antioch an equal contradiction would have been incurred because from acts xviii           it appears that during all this time aquila and priscilla were either along with st paul or were abiding at ephesus lastly had the notes of time in this epistle which we have seen to be perfectly incidental compared with the notes of time in the first epistle to the corinthians which are equally incidental fixed this epistle to be either cotemporary with that or prior to it a similar contradiction would have ensued because first when the epistle to the corinthians was written aquila and priscilla were along with st paul as they joined in the salutation of that church   cor xvi    and because secondly the history does not allow us to suppose that between the time of their becoming acquainted with st paul and the time of st pauls writing to the corinthians aquila and priscilla could have gone to rome so as to have been saluted in an epistle to that city and then come back to st paul at ephesus so as to be joined with him in saluting the church of corinth as it is all things are consistent the epistle to the romans is posterior even to the second epistle to the corinthians because it speaks of a contribution in achaia being completed which the second epistle to the corinthians chap viii is only soliciting it is sufficiently therefore posterior to the first epistle to the corinthians to allow time in the interval for aquila and priscillas return from ephesus to rome  before we dismiss these two persons we may take notice of the terms of commendation in which st paul describes them and of the agreement of that encomium with the history my helpers in christ jesus who have for my life laid down their necks unto whom not only i give thanks but also all the churches of the gentiles in the eighteenth chapter of the acts we are informed that aquila and priscilla were jews that st paul first met with them at corinth that for some time he abode in the same house with them that st pauls contention at corinth was with the unbelieving jews who at first opposed and blasphemed and afterward with one accord raised an insurrection against him that aquila and priscilla adhered we may conclude to st paul throughout this whole contest for when he left the city they went with him acts xiii    under these circumstances it is highly probable that they should be involved in the dangers and persecutions which st paul underwent from the jews being themselves jews and by adhering to st paul in this dispute deserters as they would be accounted of the jewish cause farther as they though jews were assisting to st paul in preaching to the gentiles at corinth they had taken a decided part in the great controversy of that day the admission of the gentiles to a parity of religious situation with the jews for this conduct alone if there was no other reason they may seem to have been entitled to thanks from the churches of the gentiles they were jews taking part with gentiles yet is all this so indirectly intimated or rather so much of it left to inference in the account given in the acts that i do not think it probable that a forger either could or would have drawn his representation from thence and still less probable do i think it that without having seen the acts he could by mere accident and without truth for his guide have delivered a representation so conformable to the circumstances there recorded  the two congruities last adduced depended upon the time the two following regard the place of the epistle    chap xvi    erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you  of what city we have seen that is we have inferred from circumstances found in the epistle compared with circumstances found in the acts of the apostles and in the two epistles to the corinthians that our epistle was written during st pauls second visit to the peninsula of greece again as st paul in his epistle to the church of corinth   cor xvi   speaks of a collection going on in that city and of his desire that it might be ready against he came thither and as in this epistle he speaks of that collection being ready it follows that the epistle was written either whilst he was at corinth or after he had been there thirdly since st paul speaks in this epistle of his journey to jerusalem as about instantly to take place and as we learn acts xx   that his design and attempt was to sail upon that journey immediately from greece properly so called i e as distinguished from macedonia it is probable that he was in this country when he wrote the epistle in which he speaks of himself as upon the eve of setting out if in greece he was most likely at corinth for the two epistles to the corinthians show that the principal end of his coming into greece was to visit that city where he had founded a church certainly we know no place in greece in which his presence was so probable at least the placing of him at corinth satisfies every circumstance now that erastus was an inhabitant of corinth or had some connection with corinth is rendered a fair subject of presumption by that which is accidentally said of him in the second epistle to timothy chap iii v  0 erastus abode at corinth st paul complains of his solitude and is telling timothy what was become of his companions erastus abode at corinth but trophimus have i left at miletum sick erastus was one of those who had attended st paul in his travels acts xix    and when those travels had upon some occasion brought our apostle and his train to corinth erastus staid there for no reason so probable as that it was his home i allow that this coincidence is not so precise as some others yet i think it too clear to be produced by accident for of the many places which this same epistle has assigned to different persons and the innumerable others which it might have mentioned how came it to fix upon corinth for erastus and as far as it is a coincidence it is certainly undesigned on the part of the author of the epistle to the romans because he has not told us of what city erastus was the chamberlain or which is the same thing from what city the epistle was written the setting forth of which was absolutely necessary to the display of the coincidence if any such display had been thought of nor could the author of the epistle to timothy leave erastus at corinth from any thing he might have read in the epistle to the romans because corinth is no where in that epistle mentioned either by name or description    chap xvi    i commend unto you phoebe our sister which is a servant of the church which is at cenchrea that ye receive her in the lord as becomes saints and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she has need of you for she has been a succourer of many and of myself also cenchrea adjoined to corinth st paul therefore at the time of writing the letter was in the neighborhood of the woman whom he thus recommends but farther that st paul had before this been at cenchrea itself appears from the eighteenth chapter of the acts and appears by a circumstance as incidental and as unlike design as any that can be imagined paul after this tarried there viz at corinth yet a good while and then took his leave of the brethren and sailed thence into syria and with him priscilla and aquila having shorn his head in cenchrea for he had a vow xviii    the shaving of the head denoted the expiration of the nazaritic vow the historian therefore by the mention of this circumstance virtually tells us that st pauls vow was expired before he set forward upon his voyage having deferred probably his departure until he should be released from the restrictions under which his vow laid him shall we say that the author of the acts of the apostles feigned this anecdote of st paul at cenchrea because he had read in the epistle to the romans that phoebe a servant of the church of cenchrea had been a succourer of many and of him also or shall we say that the author of the epistle to the romans out of his own imagination created phoebe  a servant of the church at cenchrea because he read in the acts of the apostles that paul had shorn his head in that place  no iii chap i ver    now i would not have you ignorant brethren that oftentimes i purposed to come unto you but was let hitherto that i might have some fruit among you also even as among other gentiles again xv       but now having no more place in these parts and having a great desire these many years  oftentimes to come unto you whenever i take my journey into spain i will come to you for i trust to see you in my journey and to be brought on my way thitherward by you but now i go up unto jerusalem to minister to the saints when therefore i have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit i will come by you into spain  with these passages compare acts xix v    after these things were ended viz at ephesus paul purposed in the spirit when he had passed through macedonia and achaia to go to jerusalem saying after i have been there i must also see rome  let it be observed that our epistle purports to have been written at the conclusion of st pauls second journey into greece that the quotation from the acts contains words said to have been spoken by st paul at ephesus some time before he set forwards upon that journey now i contend that it is impossible that two independent fictions should have attributed to st paul the same purpose especially a purpose so specific and particular as this which was not merely a general design of visiting rome but a design of visiting rome after he had passed through macedonia and achaia and after he had performed a voyage from these countries to jerusalem the conformity between the history and the epistle is perfect in the first quotation from the epistle we find that a design of visiting rome had long dwelt in the apostles mind in the quotation from the acts we find that design expressed a considerable time before the epistle was written in the history we find that the plan which st paul had formed was to pass through macedonia and achaia after that to go to jerusalem and when he had finished his visit there to sail for rome when the epistle was written he had executed so much of his plan as to have passed through macedonia and achaia and was preparing to pursue the remainder of it by speedily setting out toward jerusalem and in this point of his travels he tells his friends at rome that when he had completed the business which carried him to jerusalem he would come to them secondly i say that the very inspection of the passages will satisfy us that they were not made up from one another  whenever i take my journey into spain i will come to you for i trust to see you in my journey and to be brought on my way thitherward by you but now i go up to jerusalem to minister to the saints when therefore i have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit i will come by you into spain  this from the epistle  paul purposed in the spirit when he had passed through macedonia and achaia to go to jerusalem saying after i have been there i must also see rome  this from the acts  if the passage in the epistle was taken from that in the acts why was spain put in if the passage in the acts was taken from that in the epistle why was spain left out if the two passages were unknown to each other nothing can account for their conformity but truth whether we suppose the history and the epistle to be alike fictitious or the history to be true but the letter spurious or the letter to be genuine but the history a fable the meeting with this circumstance in both if neither borrowed it from the other is upon all these suppositions equally inexplicable  no iv the following quotation i offer for the purpose of pointing out a geographical coincidence of so much importance that dr lardner considered it as a confirmation of the whole history of st pauls travels  chap xv ver    so that from jerusalem and round about unto illyricum i have fully preached the gospel of christ  i do not think that these words necessarily import that st paul had penetrated into illyricum or preached the gospel in that province but rather that he had come to the confines of illyricum  and that these confines were the external boundary of his travels st paul considers jerusalem as the center and is here viewing the circumference to which his travels had extended the form of expression in the original conveys this idea   illyricum was the part of this circle which he mentions in an epistle to the romans because it lay in a direction from jerusalem toward that city and pointed out to the roman readers the nearest place to them to which his travels from jerusalem had brought him the name of illyricum no where occurs in the acts of the apostles no suspicion therefore can be conceived that the mention of it was borrowed from thence yet i think it appears from these same acts that st paul before the time when he wrote his epistle to the romans had reached the confines of illyricum or however that he might have done so in perfect consistency with the account there delivered illyricum adjoins upon macedonia measuring from jerusalem toward rome it lies close behind it if therefore st paul traversed the whole country of macedonia the route would necessarily bring him to the confines of illyricum and these confines would be described as the extremity of his journey now the account of st pauls second visit to the peninsula of greece is contained in these words he departed for to go into macedonia and when he had gone over these parts and had given them much exhortation he came into greece acts xx   this account allows or rather leads us to suppose that st paul in going over macedonia  had passed so far to the west as to come into those parts of the country which were contiguous to illyricum if he did not enter into illyricum itself the history therefore and the epistle so far agree and the agreement is much strengthened by a coincidence of time at the time the epistle was written st paul might say in conformity with the history that he had come into illyricum much before that time he could not have said so for upon his former journey to macedonia his route is laid down from the time of his landing at philippi to his sailing from corinth we trace him from philippi to amphipolis and appollonia from thence to thessalonica from thessalonica to beraea from beraea to athens and from athens to corinth which track confines him to the eastern side of the peninsula and therefore keeps him all the while at a considerable distance from illyricum upon his second visit to macedonia the history we have seen leaves him at liberty it must have been therefore upon that second visit if at all that he approached illyricum and this visit we know almost immediately preceded the writing of the epistle it was natural that the apostle should refer to a journey which was fresh in his thoughts  no v chap xv ver  0 now i beseech you brethren for the lord jesus christs sake and for the love of the spirit that ye strive together with me in your prayers to god for me that i may be delivered from them that do not believe in judaea  with this compare acts xx        and now behold i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there save that the holy ghost witnesses in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me  let it be remarked that it is the same journey to jerusalem which is spoken of in these two passages that the epistle was written immediately before st paul set forwards upon this journey from achaia that the words in the acts were uttered by him when he had proceeded in that journey as far as miletus in lesser asia this being remembered i observe that the two passages without any resemblance between them that could induce us to suspect that they were borrowed from one another represent the state of st pauls mind with respect to the event of the journey in terms of substantial agreement they both express his sense of danger in the approaching visit to jerusalem they both express the doubt which dwelt upon his thoughts concerning what might there befall him when in his epistle he entreats the roman christians for the lord jesus christs sake and for the love of the spirit to strive together with him in their prayers to god for him that he might be delivered from them which do not believe in judaea he sufficiently confesses his fears in the acts of the apostles we see in him the same apprehensions and the same uncertainty i go bound in the spirit to jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there the only difference is that in the history his thoughts are more inclined to despondency than in the epistle in the epistle he retains his hope that he should come unto them with joy by the will of god in the history his mind yields to the reflection that the holy ghost witnesses in every city that bonds and afflictions awaited him now that his fears should be greater and his hopes less in this stage of his journey than when he wrote his epistle that is when he first set out upon it is no other alteration than might well be expected since those prophetic intimations to which he refers when he says the holy ghost witnesses in every city had probably been received by him in the course of his journey and were probably similar to what we know he received in the remaining part of it at tire xxi   and afterward from agabus at caesarea xxi     no vi there is another strong remark arising from the same passage in the epistle to make which understood it will be necessary to state the passage over again and somewhat more at length  i beseech you brethren for the lord jesus christs sake and for the love of the spirit that ye strive together with me in your prayers to god for me that i may be delivered from them that do not believe in judaea  that i may come unto you with joy by the will of god and may with you be refreshed  i desire the reader to call to mind that part of st pauls history which took place after his arrival at jerusalem and which employs the seven last chapters of the acts and i build upon it this observation  that supposing the epistle to the romans to have been a forgery and the author of the forgery to have had the acts of the apostles before him and to have there seen that st paul in fact was not delivered from the unbelieving jews but on the contrary that he was taken into custody at jerusalem and brought to rome a prisoner  it is next to impossible that he should have made st paul express expectations so contrary to what he saw had been the event and utter prayers with apparent hopes of success which he must have known were frustrated in the issue  this single consideration convinces me that no concert or consederacy whatever subsisted between the epistle and the acts of the apostles and that whatever coincidences have been or can be pointed out between them are unsophisticated and are the result of truth and reality  it also convinces me that the epistle was written not only in st pauls life time but before he arrived at jerusalem for the important events relating to him which took place after his arrival at that city must have been known to the christian community soon after they happened they form the most public part of his history but had they been known to the author of the epistle  in other words had they then taken place  the passage which we have quoted from the epistle would not have been found there  no vii i now proceed to state the conformity which exists between the argument of this epistle and the history of its reputed author it is enough for this purpose to observe that the object of the epistle that is of the argumentative part of it was to place the gentile convert upon a parity of situation with the jewish in respect of his religious condition and his rank in the divine favor the epistle supports this point by a variety of arguments such as that no man of either description was justified by the works of the law  for this plain reason that no man had performed them that it became therefore necessary to appoint another medium or condition of justification in which new medium the jewish peculiarity was merged and lost that abrahams own justification was anterior to the law and independent of it that the jewish converts were to consider the law as now dead and themselves as married to another that what the law in truth could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god had done by sending his son that god had rejected the unbelieving jews and had substituted in their place a society of believers in christ collected indifferently from jews and gentiles soon after the writing of this epistle st paul agreeably to the intention intimated in the epistle itself took his journey to jerusalem the day after he arrived there he was introduced to the church what passed at this interview is thus related acts xxi    when he had saluted them he declared particularly what things god had wrought among the gentiles by his ministry and when they heard it they glorified the lord and said unto him thou see brother how many thousands of jews there are which believe and they are all zealous of the law and they are informed of thee that thou teach all the jews which are among the gentiles to forsake moses saying that they ought not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs st paul disclaimed the charge but there must have been something to have led to it now it is only to suppose that st paul openly professed the principles which the epistle contains that in the course of his ministry he had uttered the sentiments which he is here made to write and the matter is accounted for concerning the accusation which public rumor had brought against him to jerusalem i will not say that it was just but i will say that if he was the author of the epistle before us and if his preaching was consistent with his writing it was extremely natural for though it be not a necessary surely it is an easy inference that if the gentile convert who did not observe the law of moses held as advantageous a situation in his religious interests as the jewish convert who did there could be no strong reason for observing that law at all the remonstrance therefore of the church of jerusalem and the report which occasioned it were founded in no very violent misconstruction of the apostles doctrine his reception at jerusalem was exactly what i should have expected the author of this epistle to have met with i am entitled therefore to argue that a separate narrative of effects experienced by st paul similar to what a person might be expected to experience who held the doctrines advanced in this epistle forms a proof that he did hold these doctrines and that the epistle bearing his name in which such doctrines are laid down actually proceeded from him  no viii this number is supplemental to the former i propose to point out in it two particulars in the conduct of the argument perfectly adapted to the historical circumstances under which the epistle was written which yet are free from all appearance of contrivance and which it would not i think have entered into the mind of a sophist to contrive    the epistle to the galatians relates to the same general question as the epistle to the romans st paul had founded the church of galatia at rome he had never been observe now a difference in his manner of treating of the same subject corresponding with this difference in his situation in the epistle to the galatians he puts the point in a great measure upon authority i marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of christ unto another gospel gal i   i certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for i neither received it of man neither was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ chapter i ver       i am afraid lest i have bestowed upon you labor in vain iv       i desire to be present with you now for i stand in doubt of you iv  0 behold i paul say unto you that if ye be circumcised christ shall profit you nothing chapter v   this persuasion comes not of him that called you chapter v   this is the style in which he accosts the galatians in the epistle to the converts of rome where his authority was not established nor his person known he puts the same point entirely upon argument the perusal of the epistle will prove this to the satisfaction of every reader and as the observation relates to the whole contents of the epistle i forbear adducing separate extracts i repeat therefore that we have pointed out a distinction in the two epistles suited to the relation in which the author stood to his different correspondents  another adaptation and somewhat of the same kind is the following    the jews we know were very numerous at rome and probably formed a principal part amongst the new converts so much so that the christians seem to have been known at rome rather as a denomination of jews than as any thing else in an epistle consequently to the roman believers the point to be endeavored after by st paul was to reconcile the jewish converts to the opinion that the gentiles were admitted by god to a parity of religious situation with themselves and that without their being bound by the law of moses the gentile converts would probably accede to this opinion very readily in this epistle therefore though directed to the roman church in general it is in truth a jew writing to jews accordingly you will take notice that as often as his argument leads him to say any thing derogatory from the jewish institution he constantly follows it by a softening clause having ii       pronounced not much perhaps to the satisfaction of the native jews that he is not a jew which is one outwardly neither that circumcision which is outward in the flesh he adds immediately what advantage then has the jew or what profit is there in circumcision much every way having in the third chapter ver    brought his argument to this formal conclusion that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law he presently subjoins ver    do we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea we establish the law in the seventh chapter when in the sixth verse he had advanced the bold assertion that now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held in the very next verse he comes in with this healing question what shall we say then is the law sin god forbid nay i had not known sin but by the law having in the following words insinuated or rather more than insinuated the inefficacy of the jewish law viii   for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh after a digression indeed but that sort of a digression which he could never resist a rapturous contemplation of his christian hope and which occupies the latter part of this chapter we find him in the next as if sensible that he had said something which would give offense returning to his jewish brethren in terms of the warmest affection and respect i say the truth in christ jesus i lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the holy ghost that i have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart for i could wish that myself were accursed from christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh who are israelites to whom pertains the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh christ came when in the thirtyfirst and thirtysecond verses of this ninth chapter he represented to the jews the error of even the best of their nation by telling them that israel which followed after the law of righteousness had not attained to the law of righteousness because they sought it not by faith but as it were by the works of the law for they stumbled at that stumblingstone he takes care to annex to his declaration these conciliating expressions brethren my hearts desire and prayer to god for israel is that they might be saved for i bear them record that they have a zeal of god but not according to knowledge lastly having chapter x ver  0    by the application of a passage in isaiah insinuated the most ungrateful of all propositions to a jewish ear the rejection of the jewish nation as gods peculiar people he hastens as it were to qualify the intelligence of their fall by this interesting expostulation i say then has god cast away his people i e wholly and entirely god forbid for i also am an israelite of the seed of abraham of the tribe of benjamin god has not cast away his people which he foreknew and follows this thought throughout the whole of the eleventh chapter in a series of reflections calculated to soothe the jewish converts as well as to procure from their gentile brethren respect to the jewish institution now all this is perfectly natural in a real st paul writing to real converts it is what anxiety to bring them over to his persuasion would naturally produce but there is an earnestness and a personality if i may so call it in the manner which a cold forgery i apprehend would neither have conceived nor supported  chap iii the first epistle to the corinthians no i before we proceed to compare this epistle with the history or with any other epistle we will employ one number in stating certain remarks applicable to our argument which arise from a persual of the epistle itself  by an expression in the first verse of the seventh chapter now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me it appears that this letter to the corinthians was written by st paul in answer to one which he had received from them and that the seventh and some of the following chapters are taken up in resolving certain doubts and regulating certain points of order concerning which the corinthians had in their letter consulted him this alone is a circumstance considerably in favor of the authenticity of the epistle for it must have been a farfetched contrivance in a forgery first to have feigned the receipt of a letter from the church of corinth which letter does not appear and then to have drawn up a fictitious answer to it relative to a great variety of doubts and enquiries purely oeconomical and domestic and which though likely enough to have occurred to an infant society in a situation and under an institution so novel as that of a christian church then was it must have very much exercised the authors invention and could have answered no imaginable purpose of forgery to introduce the mention of at all particulars of the kind we refer to are such as the following the rule of duty and prudence relative to entering into marriage as applicable to virgins to widows the case of husbands married to unconverted wives of wives having unconverted husbands that case where the unconverted party chooses to separate where he chooses to continue the union the effect which their conversion produced upon their prior state of circumcision of slavery the eating of things offered to idols as it was in itself as others were affected by it the joining in idolatrous sacrifices the decorum to be observed in their religious assemblies the order of speaking the silence of women the covering or uncovering of the head as it became men as it became women these subjects with their several subdivisions are so particular minute and numerous that though they be exactly agreeable to the circumstances of the persons to whom the letter was written nothing i believe but the existence and reality of those circumstances could have suggested to the writers thoughts  but this is not the only nor the principal observation upon the correspondence between the church of corinth and their apostle which i wish to point out it appears i think in this correspondence that although the corinthians had written to st paul requesting his answer and his directions in the several points above enumerated yet that they had not said one syllable about the enormities and disorders which had crept in amongst them and in the blame of which they all shared but that st pauls information concerning the irregularities then prevailing at corinth had come round to him from other quarters the quarrels and disputes excited by their contentious adherence to their different teachers and by their placing of them in competition with one another were not mentioned in their letter but communicated to st paul by more private intelligence it has been declared unto me my brethren by them which are of the house of chloe that there are contentions among you now this i say that every one of you says i am of paul and i of apollos and i of cephas and i of christ i       the incestuous marriage of a man with his fathers wife which st paul reprehends with so much severity in the fifth chapter of our epistle and which was not the crime of an individual only but a crime in which the whole church by tolerating and conniving at it had rendered themselves partakers did not come to st pauls knowledge by the letter but by a rumor which had reached his ears  it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such fornication as is not so much as named among the gentiles that one should have his fathers wife and ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that has done this deed might be taken away from among you v     their going to law before the judicature of the country rather than arbitrate and adjust their disputes among themselves which st paul animadverts upon with his usual plainness was not intimated to him in the letter because he tells them his opinion of this conduct before he comes to the contents of the letter their litigiousness is censured by st paul in the sixth chapter of his epistle and it is only at the beginning of the seventh chapter that he proceeds upon the articles which he found in their letter and he proceeds upon them with this preface now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me vii   which introduction he would not have used if he had been already discussing any of the subjects concerning which they had written their irregularities in celebrating the lords supper and the utter perversion of the institution which ensued were not in the letter as is evident from the terms in which st paul mentions the notice he had received of it now in this that i declare unto you i praise you not that ye came together not for the better but for the worse for first of all when ye come together in the church i hear that there be divisions among you and i partly believe it now that the corinthians should in their own letter exhibit the fair side of their conduct to the apostle and conceal from him the faults of their behavior was extremely natural and extremely probable but it was a distinction which would not i think have easily occurred to the author of a forgery and much less likely is it that it should have entered into his thoughts to make the distinction appear in the way in which it does appear viz not by the original letter not by any express observation upon it in the answer but distantly by marks perceivable in the manner or in the order in which st paul takes  of their faults  no ii our epistle purports to have been written after st paul had already been at corinth i brethren when i came to you came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom ii   and in many other places to the same effect it purports also to have been written upon the eve of another visit to that church i will come to you shortly if the lord will iv    and again i will come to you when i shall pass through macedonia xvi   now the history relates that st paul did in fact visit corinth twice once as recorded at length in the eighteenth and a second time as mentioned briefly in the twentieth chapter of the acts the same history also informs us acts xx   that it was from ephesus st paul proceeded upon his second journey into greece therefore as the epistle purports to have been written a short time preceding that journey and as st paul the history tells us had resided more than two years at ephesus before he set out upon it it follows that it must have been from ephesus to be consistent with the history that the epistle was written and every note of place in the epistle agrees with this supposition if after the manner of men i have fought with beasts at ephesus what advantageth it me if the dead rise not xv    i allow that the apostle might say this wherever he was but it was more natural and more to the purpose to say it if he was at ephesus at the time and in the midst of those conflicts to which the expression relates the churches of asia salute you xvi    asia throughout the acts of the apostles and the epistles of st paul does not mean the whole of asia minor or anatolia nor even the whole of the proconsular asia but a district in the anterior part of that country called lydian asia divided from the rest much as portugal is from spain and of which district ephesus was the capital  aquila and priscilla salute you xvi    aquila and priscilla were at ephesus during the period within which this epistle was written acts xviii        i will tarry at ephesus until pentecost xvi   this i apprehend is in terms almost asserting that he was at ephesus at the time of writing the epistle  a great and effectual door is opened unto me xvi   how well this declaration corresponded with the state of things at ephesus and the progress of the gospel in these parts we learn from the reflection with which the historian concludes the account of certain transactions which passed there so mightily grew the word of god and prevailed acts xix  0 as well as from the complaint of demetrius that not only at ephesus but also throughout all asia this paul has persuaded and turned away much people xix     and there are many adversaries says the epistle xvi   look into the history of this period when diverse were hardened and believed not but spoke evil of that way before the multitude he departed from them and separated the disciples the conformity therefore upon this head of comparison is circumstantial and perfect if any one think that this is a conformity so obvious that any forger of tolerable caution and sagacity would have taken care to preserve it i must desire such a one to read the epistle for himself and when he has done so to declare whether he has discovered one mark of art or design whether the notes of time and place appear to him to be inserted with any reference to each other with any view of their being compared with each other or for the purpose of establishing a visible agreement with the history in respect of them  no iii chap iv ver      for this cause i have sent unto you timotheus who is my beloved son and faithful in the lord who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in christ as i teach every where in every church now some are puffed up as though i would not come unto you but i will come unto you shortly if the lord will  with this i compare acts xix       after these things were ended paul purposed in the spirit when he had passed through macedonia and achaia to go to jerusalem saying after i have been there i must also see rome so he sent unto macedonia two of them that ministered unto him timotheus and erastus  though it be not said it appears i think with sufficient certainty i mean from the history independently of the epistle that timothy was sent upon this occasion into achaia of which corinth was the capital city as well as into macedonia for the sending of timothy and erastus is in the passage where it is mentioned plainly connected with st pauls own journey he sent them before him as he therefore purposed to go into achaia himself it is highly probable that they were to go thither also nevertheless they are said only to have been sent into macedonia because macedonia was in truth the country to which they went immediately from ephesus being directed as we suppose to proceed afterward from thence into achaia if this be so the narrative agrees with the epistle and the agreement is attended with very little appearance of design one thing at least concerning it is certain that if this passage of st pauls history had been taken from his letter it would have sent timothy to corinth by name or expressly however into achaia  but there is another circumstance in these two passages much less obvious in which an agreement holds without any room for suspicion that it was produced by design we have observed that the sending of timothy into the peninsula of greece was connected in the narrative with st pauls own journey thither it is stated as the effect of the same resolution paul purposed to go into macedonia  so he sent two of them that ministered unto him timotheus and erastus now in the epistle also you remark that when the apostle mentions his having sent timothy unto them in the very next sentence he speaks of his own visit for this cause have i sent unto you timotheus who is my beloved son etc now some are puffed up as though i would not come to you but i will come to you shortly if god will timothys journey we see is mentioned in the history and in the epistle in close connection with st pauls own here is the same order of thought and intention yet conveyed under such diversity of circumstance and expression and the mention of them in the epistle so allied to the occasion which introduces it viz the insinuation of his adversaries that he would come to corinth no more that i am persuaded no attentive reader will believe that these passages were written in concert with one another or will doubt but that the agreement is unsought and uncontrived  but in the acts erastus accompanied timothy in this journey of whom no mention is made in the epistle from what has been said in our observations upon the epistle to the romans it appears probable that erastus was a corinthian if so though he accompanied timothy to corinth he was only returning home and timothy was the messenger charged with st pauls orders at any rate this discrepancy shows that the passages were not taken from one another  no iv chap xvi ver  0    now if timotheus come see that he may be with you without fear for he works the work of the lord as i also do let no man therefore despise him but conduct him forth in peace that he may come unto me for i look for him with the brethren  from the passage considered in the preceding number it appears that timothy was sent to corinth either with the epistle or before it for this cause have i sent unto you timotheus from the passage now quoted we infer that timothy was not sent with the epistle for had he been the bearer of the letter or accompanied it would st paul in that letter have said  if timothy come nor is the sequel consistent with the supposition of his carrying the letter for if timothy was with the apostle when he wrote the letter could he say as he does i look for him with the brethren i conclude therefore that timothy had left st paul to proceed upon his journey before the letter was written farther the passage before us seems to imply that timothy was not expected by st paul to arrive at corinth till after they had received the letter he gives them directions in the letter how to treat him when he should arrive if he come act toward him so and so lastly the whole form of expression is most naturally applicable to the supposition of timothys coming to corinth not directly from st paul but from some other quarter and that his instructions had been when he should reach corinth to return now how stands this matter in the history turn to the nineteenth chapter and twentyfirst verse of the acts and you will find that timothy did not when sent from ephesus where he left st paul and where the present epistle was written proceed by a straight course to corinth but that he went round through macedonia this clears up every thing for although timothy was sent forth upon his journey before the letter was written yet he might not reach corinth till after the letter arrived there and he would come to corinth when he did come not directly from st paul at ephesus but from some part of macedonia here therefore is a circumstantial and critical agreement and unquestionably without design for neither of the two passages in the epistle mentions timothys journey into macedonia at all though nothing but a circuit of that kind can explain and reconcile the expressions which the writer uses  no v chap   ver    now this i say that every one of you says i am of paul and i of apollos and i of cephas and i of christ  also iii   i have planted apollos watered but god gave the increase  this expression i have planted apollos watered imports two things first that paul had been at corinth before apollos secondly that apollos had been at corinth after paul but before the writing of this epistle this implied account of the several events and of the order in which they took place corresponds exactly with the history st paul after his first visit into greece returned from corinth into syria by the way of ephesus and dropping his companions aquila and priscilla at ephesus he proceeded forwards to jerusalem from jerusalem he descended to antioch and from thence made a progress through some of the upper or northern provinces of the lesser asia acts xviii       during which progress and consequently in the interval between st pauls first and second visit to corinth and consequently also before the writing of this epistle which was at ephesus two years at least after the apostles return from his progress we hear of apollos and we hear of him at corinth whilst st paul was engaged as has been said in phrygia and galatia apollos came down to ephesus and being in st pauls absence instructed by aquila and priscilla and having obtained letters of recommendation from the church at ephesus he passed over to achaia and when he was there we read that he helped them much which had believed through grace for he mightily convinced the jews and that publicly acts xviii       to have brought apollos into achaia of which corinth was the capital city as well as the principal christian church and to have shown that he preached the gospel in that country would have been sufficient for our purpose but the history happens also to mention corinth by name as the place in which apollos after his arrival in achaia fixed his residence for proceeding with the account of st pauls travels it tells us that while apollos was at corinth paul having passed through the upper coasts came down to ephesus xix   what is said therefore of apollos in the epistle coincides exactly and especially in the point of chronology with what is delivered concerning him in the history the only question now is whether the allusions were made with a regard to this coincidence now the occasions and purposes for which the name of apollos is introduced in the acts and in the epistles are so independent and so remote that it is impossible to discover the smallest reference from one to the other apollos is mentioned in the acts in immediate connection with the history of aquila and priscilla and for the very singular circumstance of his knowing only the baptism of john in the epistle where none of these circumstances are taken notice of his name first occurs for the purpose of reproving the contentious spirit of the corinthians and it occurs only in conjunction with that of some others every one of you says i am of paul and i of apollos and i of cephas and i of christ the second passage in which apollos appears i have planted apollos watered fixes as we have observed the order of time amongst three distinct events but it fixes this i will venture to pronounce without the writer perceiving that he was doing any such thing the sentence fixes this order in exact conformity with the history but it is itself introduced solely for the sake of the reflection which follows neither is he that planteth any thing neither he that waters but god that gives the increase  no vi chap iv ver       even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffetted and have no certain dewlling place and labor working with our own hands  we are expressly told in the history that at corinth st paul labored with his own hands he found aquila and priscilla and because he was of the same craft he abode with them and wrought for by their occupation they were tentmakers but in the text before us he is made to say that he labored even unto the present hour that is to the time of writing the epistle at ephesus now in the narration of st pauls transactions at ephesus delivered in the nineteenth chapter of the acts nothing is said of his working with his own hands but in the twentieth chapter we read that upon his return from greece he sent for the elders of the church of ephesus to meet him at miletus and in the discourse which he there addressed to them amidst some other reflections which he calls to their remembrance we find the following i have coveted no mans silver or gold or apparel yea you yourselves also know that these hands have ministered unto my necessities and to them that were with me the reader will not forget to remark that though st paul be now at miletus it is to the elders of the church of ephesus he is speaking when he says ye yourselves know that these hands have ministered to my necessities and that the whole discourse relates to his conduct during his last preceding residence at ephesus that manual labor therefore which he had exercised at corinth he continued at ephesus and not only so but continued it during that particular residence at ephesus near the conclusion of which this epistle was written so that he might with the strictest truth say at the time of writing the epistle even unto this present hour we labor working with our own hands the correspondency is sufficient then as to the undesignedness of it it is manifest to my judgment that if the history in this article had been taken from the epistle this circumstance if it appeared at all would have appeared in its place that is in the direct account of st pauls transactions at ephesus the correspondency would not have been effected as it is by a kind of reflected stroke that is by a reference in a subsequent speech to what in the narrative was omitted nor is it likely on the other hand that a circumstance which is not extant in the history of st paul at ephesus should have been made the subject of a factitious allusion in an epistle purporting to be written by him from that place not to mention that the allusion itself especially as to time is too oblique and general to answer any purpose of forgery whatever  no vii chap ix ver  0 and unto the jews i became as a jew that i might gain the jews to them that are under the law as under the law  we have the disposition here described exemplified in two instances which the history records one acts xvi ver   him timothy would paul have to go forth with him and took and circumcised him because of the jews in those quarters for they knew all that his father was a greek this was before the writing of the epistle the other acts xxi ver       and after the writing of the epistle do this that we say to thee we have four men which have a vow on them them take and purify thyself with them that they may shave their heads and all may know that those things whereof they were informed concerning thee are nothing but that thou thyself also walk orderly and keep the law  then paul took the men and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple nor does this concurrence between the character and the instances look like the result of contrivance st paul in the epistle describes or is made to describe his own accommodating conduct toward jews and toward gentiles toward the weak and overscrupulous toward men indeed of every variety of character to them that are without law as without law being not without law to god but under the law to christ that i might gain them that are without law to the weak became i as weak that i might gain the weak i am made all things to all men that i might gain some this is the sequel of the text which stands at the head of the present number taking therefore the whole passage together the apostles condescension to the jews is mentioned only as a part of his general disposition toward all it is not probable that this character should have been made up from the instances in the acts which relate solely to his dealings with the jews it is not probable that a sophist should take his hint from those instances and then extend it so much beyond them and it is still more incredible that the two instances in the acts circumstantially related and interwoven with the history should have been fabricated in order to suit the character which st paul gives of himself in the epistle  no viii chap i      i thank god that i baptized none of you but crispus and gaius lest any should say that i baptized in my own name and i baptized also the household of stephanas besides i know not whether i baptized any other for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel  it may be expected that those whom the apostle baptized with his own hands were converts distinguished from the rest by some circumstance either of eminence or of connection with him accordingly of the three names here mentioned crispus we find from acts xviii ver   was a chief ruler of the jewish synagogue at corinth who believed in the lord with all his house gaius it appears from romans xvi    was st pauls host at corinth and the host he tells us of the whole church the household of stephanas we read in the sixteenth chapter of this epistle were the first fruits of achaia here therefore is the propriety we expected and it is a proof of reality not to be contemned for their names appearing in the several places in which they occur with a mark of distinction belonging to each could hardly be the effect of chance without any truth to direct it and on the other hand to suppose that they were picked out from these passages and brought together in the text before us in order to display a conformity of names is both improbable in itself and is rendered more so by the purpose for which they are introduced they come in to assist st pauls exculpation of himself against the possible charge of having assumed the character of the founder of a separate religion and with no other visible or as i think imaginable design chap i ver   paul called to be an apostle or jesus christ through the will of god and sosthenes our brother unto the church of god which is at corinth  the only account we have of any person who bore the name of sosthenes is found in the eighteenth chapter of the acts when the jews at corinth had brought paul before gallio and gallio had dismissed their complaint as unworthy of his interference and had driven them from the judgment seat then all the greeks says the historian took sosthenes the chief ruler of the synagogue and beat him before the judgment seat the sosthenes here spoken of was a corinthian and if he was a christian and with st paul when he wrote this epistle was likely enough to be joined with him in the salutation of the corinthian church but here occurs a difficulty if sosthenes was a christian at the time of this uproar why should the greeks beat him the assault upon the christians was made by the jews it was the jews who had brought paul before the magistrate if it had been the jews also who had beaten sosthenes i should not have doubted but that he had been a favourer of st paul and the same person who is joined with him in the epistle let us see therefore whether there be not some error in our present text the alexandrian manuscript gives  alone without  and is followed in this reading by the coptic version by the arabic version published by erpenius by the vulgate and by bedes latin version three greek manuscripts again as well as chrysostom give  in the place of  a great plurality of manuscripts authorize the reading which is retained in our copies in this variety it appears to me extremely probable that the historian originally wrote  alone and that  and  have been respectively added as explanatory of what the word  was supposed to mean the sentence without the addition of either name would run very perspicuously thus  and he drove them away from the judgment seat and they all viz the crowd of jews whom the judge had bid begone took sosthenes and beat him before the judgment seat it is certain that as the whole body of the people were greeks the application of all to them is unusual and hard if i was describing an insurrection at paris i might say all the jews all the protestants or all the english acted so and so but i should scarcely say all the french when the whole mass of the community were of that description as what is here offered is founded upon a various reading and that in opposition to the greater part of the manuscripts that are extant i have not given it a place in the text   no ix chap xvi ver  0    now if timotheus come let no man despise him  why despise him this charge is not given concerning any other messenger whom st paul sent and in the different epistles many such messengers are mentioned turn to   timothy chap iv ver    and you will find that timothy was a young man younger probably than those who were usually employed in the christian mission and that st paul apprehending lest he should on that account be exposed to contempt urges upon him the caution which is there inserted let no man despise the youth  no x chap xvi ver   now concerning the collection for the saints as i have given order to the churches of galatia even so do ye  the churches of galatia and phrygia were the last churches which st paul had visited before the writing of this epistle he was now at ephesus and he came thither immediately from visiting these churches he went over all the country of galatia and phrygia in order strengthening all the disciples and it came to pass that paul having passed through the upper coasts viz the abovenamed countries called the upper coasts as being the northern part of asia minor came to ephesus acts xviii ver    xix   these therefore probably were the last churches at which he had left directions for their public conduct during his absenc although two years intervened between his journey to ephesus and his writing this epistle yet it does not appear that during that time he visited any other church that he had not been silent when he was in galatia upon this subject of contribution for the poor is farther made out from a hint which he lets fall in his epistle to that church only they viz the other apostles would that we should remember the poor the same also which i was forward to do  no xi chap iv ver    now some are puffed up as though i would not come unto you  why should they suppose that he would not come turn to the first chapter of the second epistle to the corinthians and you will find that he had already disappointed them i was minded to come unto you before that you might have a second benefit and to pass by you into macedonia and to come again out of macedonia unto you and of you to be brought on my way toward judea when i therefore was thus minded did i use lightness or the things that i purpose do i purpose according to the flesh that with me there should be yea yea and nay nay but as god is true our word toward you was not yea and nay it appears from this quotation that he had not only intended but that he had promised them a visit before for otherwise why should he apologize for the change of his purpose or express so much anxiety lest this change should be imputed to any culpable fickleness in his temper and lest he should thereby seem to them as one whose word was not in any sort to be depended upon besides which the terms made use of plainly refer to a promise our word toward you was not yea and nay st paul therefore had signified an intention which he had not been able to execute and this seeming breach of his word and the delay of his visit had with some who were evil affected toward him given birth to a suggestion that he would come no more to corinth  no xii chap v ver     for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth  dr benson tells us that from this passage compared with chapter xvi ver   it has been conjectured that this epistle was written about the time of the jewish passover and to me the conjecture appears to be very well founded the passage to which dr benson refers us is this i will tarry at ephesus until pentecost with this passage he ought to have joined another in the same context and it may be that i will abide yea and winter with you for from the two passages laid together it follows that the epistle was written before pentecost yet after winter which necessarily determines the date to the part of the year within which the passover falls it was written before pentecost because he says i will tarry at ephesus until pentecost it was written after winter because he tells them it may be that i may abide yea and winter with you the winter which the apostle purposed to pass at corinth was undoubtedly the winter next ensuing to the date of the epistle yet it was a winter subsequent to the ensuing pentecost because he did not intend to set forwards upon his journey till after that feast the words let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth look very like words suggested by the season at least they have upon that supposition a force and significancy which do not belong to them upon any other and it is not a little remarkable that the hints casually dropped in the epistle concerning particular parts of the year should coincide with this supposition  chap iv the second epistle to the corinthians no i i will not say that it is impossible having seen the first epistle to the corinthians to construct a second with ostensible allusions to the first or that it is impossible that both sold be fabricated so as to carry on an order and continuation of story by successive references to the same events but i say that this in either case must be the effect of craft and design whereas whoever examines the allusions to the former epistle which he finds in this whilst he will acknowledge them to be such as would rise spontaneously to the hand of the writer from the very subject of the correspondence and the situation of the corresponding parties supposing these to be real will see no particle of reason to suspect either that the clauses containing these allusions were insertions for the purpose or that the several transactions of the corinthian church were feigned in order to form a train of narrative or to support the appearance of connection between the two epistles    in the first epistle st paul announces his intention of passing through macedonia in his way to corinth i will come to you when i shall pass through macedonia in the second epistle we find him arrived in macedonia and about to pursue his journey to corinth but observe the manner in which this is made to appear i know the forwardness of your mind for which i boast of you to them of macedonia that achaia was ready a year ago and your zeal has provoked very many yet have i sent the brethren lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf that as i said ye may be ready lest happily if they of macedonia come with me and find you unprepared we that we say not you be ashamed in this same confident boasting chap ix       st pauls being in macedonia at the time of writing the epistle is in this passage inferred only from his saying that he had boasted to the macedonians of the alacrity of his achaian converts and the fear which he expresses lest if any of the macedonian christians should come with him into achaia they should sind his boasting unwarranted by the event the business of the contribution is the sole cause of mentioning macedonia at all will it be insinuated that this passage was framed merely to state that st paul was now in macedonia and by that statement to produce an apparent agreement with the purpose of visiting macedonia notified in the first epistle or will it be thought probable that if a sophist had meant to place st paul in macedonia for the sake of giving countenance to his forgery he would have done it in so oblique a manner as through the medium of the contribution the same thing may be observed of another text in the epistle in which the name of macedonia occurs furthermore when i came to troas to preach the gospel and a door was opened unto me of the lord i had no rest in my spirit because i found not titus my brother but taking my leave of them i went from thence into macedonia i mean that it may be observed of this passage also that there is a reason for mentioning macedonia entirely distinct from the purpose of showing st paul to be there indeed if the passage before us show that point at all it shows it so obscurely that grotius though he did not doubt that paul was now in macedonia refers this text to a different journey is this the hand of a forger meditating to establish a false conformity the text however in which it is most strongly implied that st paul wrote the present epistle from macedonia is found in the fourth fifth and sixth verses of the seventh chapter i am filled with comfort i am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation for when we were come into macedonia our flesh had no rest without were fightings within were fears nevertheless god that comfort those that are cast down comforted us by the coming of titus yet even here i think no one will contend that st pauls coming to macedonia or being in macedonia was the principal thing intended to be told or that the telling of it indeed was any part of the intention with which the text was written or that the mention even of the name of macedonia was not purely incidental in the description of those tumultuous sorrows with which the writers mind had been lately agitated and from which he was relieved by the coming of titus the sive first verses of the eighth chapter which commend the liberality of the macedonian churches do not in my opinion by themselves prove st paul to have been in macedonia at the time of writing the epistle    in the first epistle st paul denounces a severe censure against an incestuous marriage which had taken place amongst the corinthian converts with the connivance not to say with the approbation of the church and enjoins the church to purge itself of this scandal by expelling the offender from its society it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such fornication as is not so much as named amongst the gentiles that one should have his fathers wife and ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that has done this deed might be taken away from among you for i verily as absent in body but present in spirit have judged already as though i were present concerning him that has so done this deed in the name of our lord jesus christ when ye are gathered together and my spirit with the power of our lord jesus christ to deliver such a one unto satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord chap v ver    in the second epistle we sind this sentence executed and the offender to be so affected with the punishment that st paul now intercedes for his restoration sufficient to such a man is this punishment which was inflicted of many so that contrariwise ye ought rather to sorgive him and comfort him lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow wherefore i beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him   cor chap ii ver     is this whole business feigned for the sake of carrying on a continuation of story through the two epistles the church also no less than the offender was brought by st pauls reproof to a deep sense of the impropriety of their conduct their penitence and their respect to his authority were as might be expected exceedingly grateful to st paul we were comforted not by tituss coming only but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you when he told us your earnest desire your mourning your fervent mind toward me so that i rejoiced the more for bough i made you sorry with a letter i do not repent though i did repent for i perceive that the same epistle made you sorry though it were but for a season now i rejoice not that ye were made sorry but that ye sorrowed to repentance for ye were made sorry after a godly manner that ye might receive damage by us in nothing chap vii    that this passage is to be referred to the incestuous marriage is proved by the twelfth verse of the same chapter though i wrote unto you i did it not for his cause that had done the wrong nor for his cause that suffered wrong but that our care for you in the sight of god might appear unto you there were it is true various topics of blame noticed in the first epistle but there was none except this of the incestuous marriage which could be called a transaction between private parties or of which it could be said that one particular person had done the wrong and another particular person had suffered it could all this be without foundation or could it be put into the second epistle merely to furnish an obscure sequel to what had been said about an incestuous marriage in the first    in the sixteenth chapter of the first epistle a collection for the saints is recommended to be set forwards at corinth now concerning the collection for the saints as i have given order to the churches of galatia so do ye chap xvi ver   in the ninth chapter of the second epistle such a collection is spoken of as in readiness to be received as touching the ministering to the saints it is superfluous for me to write to you for i know the forwardness of your mind for which i boast of you to them of macedonia that achaia was ready a year ago and your zeal has provoked very many chap ix ver     this is such a continuation of the transaction as might be expected or possibly it will be said as might easily be counterfeited but there is a circumstance of nicety in the agreement between the two epistles which i am convinced the author of a forgery would not have hit upon or which if he had hit upon it he would have set forth with more clearness the second epistle speaks of the corinthians as having begun this eleemosynary business a year before this is expedient for you who have begun before not only to do but also to be forward a year ago chap viii ver  0 i boast of you to them of macedonia that achaia was ready a year ago chap ix ver   from these texts it is evident that something had been done in the business a year before it appears however from other texts in the epistle that the contribution was not yet collected or paid for brethren were sent from st paul to corinth to make up their bounty chap ix ver   they are urged to perform the doing of it chap viii ver    and every man was exhorted to give as he purposed in his heart chap ix ver   the contribution therefore as represented in our present epistle was in readiness yet not received from the contributors was begun was forward long before yet not hitherto collected now this representation agrees with one and only with one supposition namely that every man had laid by in store had already provided the fund from which he was afterward to contribute  the very case which the first epistle authorizes us to suppose to have existed for in that epistle st paul had charged the corinthians upon the first day of the week every one of them to lay by in store as god had prospered him the following observations will satisfy us concerning the purity of our apostles conduct in the suspicious business of a pecuniary contribution    he disclaims the having received any inspired authority for the directions which he is giving i speak not by commandment but by occasion of the forwardness of others and to prove the sincerity of your love   cor chap viii ver   who that had a sinister purpose to answer by the recommending of subscriptions would thus distinguish and thus lower the credit of his own recommendation    although he asserts the general right of christian ministers to a maintenance from their ministry yet he protests against the making use of this right in his own person even so has the lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel but i have used none of these things neither have i written these things that it should be so done unto me for it were better for me to die than that any man should make my glorying i e my professions of disinterestedness void   cor chap ix ver          he repeatedly proposes that there should be associates with himself in the management of the public bounty not colleagues of his own appointment but persons elected for that purpose by the contributors themselves and when i come whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters them will i send to bring your liberality unto jerusalem and if it be meet that i go also they shall go with me   cor chap xvi ver     and in the second epistle what is here proposed we find actually done and done for the very purpose of guarding his character against any imputation that might be brought upon it in the discharge of a pecuniary trust and we have sent with him the brother whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches and not that only but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace gift which is administered by us to the glory of the same lord and the declaration of your ready mind avoiding this that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us providing for things honest not only in the sight of the lord but also in the sight of men i e not resting in the consciousness of our own integrity but in such a subject careful also to approve our integrity to the public judgment   cor chap viii ver          cor chap xvi ver    no ii in comparing the second epistle to the corinthians with the acts of the apostles we are soon brought to observe not only that there exists no vestige either of the epistle having been taken from the history or the history from the epistle but also that there appears in the contents of the epistle positive evidence that neither was borrowed from the other titus who bears a conspicuous part in the epistle is not mentioned in the acts of the apostles at all st pauls sufferings enumerated chap xi ver    of the jews five times received i forty stripes save one thrice was i beaten with rods once was i stoned thrice i suffered shipwreck a night and a day i have been in the deep cannot be made out from his history as delivered in the acts nor would this account have been given by a writer who either drew his knowledge of st paul from that history or who was careful to preserve a conformity with it the account in the epistle of st pauls escape from damascus though agreeing in the main fact with the account of the same transaction in the acts is related with such difference of circumstance as renders it utterly improbable that one should be derived from the other the two accounts placed by the side of each other stand as follows    cor chap xi ver       in damascus the governor under aretas the king kept the city of the damascenes with a garrison desirous to apprehend me and through a window in a basket was i let down by the wall and escaped his hands acts chap ix ver      and after many days were fulfilled the jews took counsel to kill him but their laying in wait was known of saul and they watched the gates day and night to kill him then the disciples took him by night and let him down by the wall in a basket  now if we be satisfied in general concerning these two ancient writings that the one was not known to the writer of the other or not consulted by him then the accordances which may be pointed out between them will admit of no solution so probable as the attributing of them to truth and reality as to their common foundation  no iii the opening of this epistle exhibits a connection with the history which alone would satisfy my mind that the epistle was written by st paul and by st paul in the situation in which the history places him let it be remembered that in the nineteenth chapter of the acts st paul is represented as driven away from ephesus or as leaving however ephesus in consequence of an uproar in that city excited by some interested adversaries of the new religion the account of the tumult is as follows when they heard these sayings viz demetriuss complaint of the danger to be apprehended from st pauls ministry to the established worship of the ephesian goddess they were full of wrath and cried out saying great is diana of the ephesians and the whole city was filled with confusion and having caught gaius and aristarchus pauls companions in travel they rushed with one accord into the theater and when paul would have entered in unto the people the disciples suffered him not and certain of the chief of asia which were his friends sent unto him desiring that he would not adventure himself into the theater some therefore cried one thing and some another for the assembly was confused and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together and they drew alexander out of the multitude the jews putting him forward and alexander beckoned with his hand and would have made his defense unto the people but when they knew that he was a jew all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out great is diana of the ephesians  and after the uproar was ceased paul called unto him the disciples and embraced them and departed for to go into macedonia when he was arrived in macedonia he wrote the second epistle to the corinthians which is now before us and he begins his epistle in this wise blessed be god even the father of our lord jesus christ the father of mercies and the god of all comfort who comfort us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of god for as the sufferings of christ abound in us so our consolation also abounds by christ and whether we be afflicted it is for your consolation and salvation which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer or whether we be comforted it is for your consolation and salvation and our hope of you is steadfast knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings so shall ye be also of the consolation for we would not brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in asia that we were pressed out of measure above strength insomuch that we despaired even of life but we had the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in god which raises the dead who delivered us from so great a death and does deliver in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us nothing could be more expressive of the circumstances in which the history describes st paul to have been at the time when the epistle purports to be written or rather nothing could be more expressive of the sensations arising from these circumstances than this passage it is the calm recollection of a mind emerged from the confusion of instant danger it is that devotion and solemnity of thought which follows a recent deliverance there is just enough of particularity in the passage to show that it is to be referred to the tumult at ephesus we would not brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in asia and there is nothing more no mention of demetrius of the seizure of st pauls friends of the interference of the town clerk of the occasion or nature of the danger which st paul had escaped or even of the city where it happened in a word no recital from which a suspicion could be conceived either that the author of the epistle had made use of the narrative in the acts or on the other hand that he had sketched the outline which the narrative in the acts only filled up that the forger of an epistle under the name of st paul should borrow circumstances from a history of st paul then extant or that the author of a history of st paul should gather materials from letters bearing st pauls name may be credited but i cannot believe that any forger whatever should fall upon an expedient so resined as to exhibit sentiments adapted to a situation and to leave his readers to seek out that situation from the history still less that the author of a history should go about to frame facts and circumstances fitted to supply the sentiments which he found in the letter it may be said perhaps that it does not appear from the history that any danger threatened st pauls life in the uproar at ephesus so imminent as that from which in the epistle he represents himself to have been delivered this matter it is true is not stated by the historian in form but the personal danger of the apostle we cannot doubt must have been extreme when the whole city was filled with confusion when the populace had seized his companions when in the distraction of his mind he insisted upon coming forth amongst them when the christians who were about him would not suffer him when his friends certain of the chief of asia sent to him desiring that he would not adventure himself in the tumult when lastly he was obliged to quit immediately the place and the country and when the tumult was ceased to depart into macedonia all which particulars are found in the narration and justify st pauls own account that he was pressed out of measure above strength insomuch that he despaired even of life that he had the sentence of death in himself i e that he looked upon himself as a man condemned to die  no iv it has already been remarked that st pauls original intention was to have visited corinth in his way to macedonia i was minded to come unto you before and to pass by you into macedonia   cor chap i ver       it has also been remarked that he changed this intention and ultimately resolved upon going through macedonia first now upon this head there exists a circumstance of correspondency between our epistle and the history which is not very obvious to the readers observation but which when observed will be found i think close and exact which circumstance is this that though the change of st pauls intention be expressly mentioned only in the second epistle yet it appears both from the history and from this second epistle that the change had taken place before the writing of the first epistle that it appears however from neither otherwise than by an inference unnoticed perhaps by almost every one who does not sit down professedly to the examination  first then how does this point appear from the history in the nineteenth chapter of the acts and the twentyfirst verse we are told that paul purposed in the spirit when he had passed through macedonia and achaia to go to jerusalem so he sent into macedonia two of them that ministered unto him timotheus and erastus but he himself stayed in asia for a season a short time after this and evidently in pursuance of the same intention we find chap xx ver     that paul departed from ephesus for to go into macedonia and that when he had gone over those parts he came into greece the resolution therefore of passing first through macedonia and from thence into greece was formed by st paul previously to the sending away of timothy the order in which the two countries are mentioned shows the direction of his intended route when he had passed through macedonia and achaia timothy and erastus who were to precede him in his progress were sent by him from ephesus into macedonia he himself a short time afterward and as has been observed evidently in continuation and pursuance of the same design departed for to go into macedonia if he had ever therefore entertained a different plan of his journey which is not hinted in the history he must have changed that plan before this time but from the seventeenth verse of the fourth chapter of the first epistle to the corinthians we discover that timothy had been sent away from ephesus before that epistle was written for this cause have i sent unto you timotheus who is my beloved son the change therefore of st pauls resolution which was prior to the sending away of timothy was necessarily prior to the writing of the first epistle to the corinthians  thus stands the order of dates as collected from the history compared with the first epistle now let us enquire secondly how this matter is represented in the epistle before us in the sixteenth verse of the first chapter of this epistle st paul speaks of the intention which he had once entertained of visiting achaia in his way to macedonia in this confidence i was minded to come unto you before that ye might have a second benefit and to pass by you into macedonia after protesting in the seventeenth verse against any evil construction that might be put upon his laying aside of this intention in the twentythird verse he discloses the cause of it moreover i call god for a record upon my soul that to spare you i came not as yet unto corinth and then he proceeds as follows but i determined this with myself that i would not come again to you in heaviness for if i make you sorry who is he then that makes me glad but the same which is made sorry by me and i wrote this same unto you lest when i came i should have sorrow from them of whom i ought to rejoice having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you all for out of much affliction and anguish of heart i wrote unto you with many tears not that ye should be grieved but that ye might know the love which i have more abundantly unto you but if any have caused grief he has not grieved me but in part that i may not overcharge you all sufficient to such a man is this punishment which was inflicted of many in this quotation let the reader first direct his attention to the clause marked by italics and i wrote this same unto you and let him consider whether from the context and from the structure of the whole passage it be not evident that this writing was after st paul had determined with himself that he would not come again to them in heaviness whether indeed it was not in consequence of this determination or at least with this determination upon his mind and in the next place let him consider whether the sentence i determined this with myself that i would not come again to you in heaviness do not plainly refer to that postponing of his visit to which he had alluded in the verse but one before when he said i call god for a record upon my soul that to spare you i came not as yet to corinth and whether this be not the visit of which he speaks in the sixteenth verse wherein he informs the corinthians that he had been minded to pass by them into macedonia but that for reasons which argued no levity or fickleness in his disposition he had been compelled to change his purpose if this be so then it follows that the writing here mentioned was posterior to the change of his intention the only question therefore that remains will be whether this writing relate to the letter which we now have under the title of the first epistle to the corinthians or to some other letter not extant and upon this question i think mr lockes observation decisive namely that the second clause marked in the quotation by italics i wrote unto you with many tears and the first clause so marked i wrote this same unto you belong to one writing whatever that was and that the second clause goes on to advert to a circumstance which is found in our present first epistle to the corinthians namely the case and punishment of the incestuous person upon the whole then we see that it is capable of being inferred from st pauls own words in the long extract which we have quoted that the first epistle to the corinthians was written after st paul had determined to postpone his journey to corinth in other words that the change of his purpose with respect to the course of his journey though expressly mentioned only in the second epistle had taken place before the writing of the first the point which we made out to be implied in the history by the order of the events there recorded and the allusions to those events in the first epistle now this is a species of congruity of all others the most to be relied upon it is not an agreement between two accounts of the same transaction or between different statements of the same fact for the fact is not stated nothing that can be called an account is given but it is the junction of two conclusions deduced from independent sources and deducible only by investigation and comparison  this point viz the change of the route being prior to the writing of the first epistle also falls in with and accounts for the manner in which he speaks in that epistle of his journey his first intention had been as he here declares to pass by them into macedonia that intention having been previously given up he writes in his first epistle that he would not see them now by the way i e as he must have done upon his first plan but that he trusted to tarry awhile with them and possibly to abide yea and winter with them   cor chap xvi ver     it also accounts for a singularity in the text referred to which must strike every reader i will come to you when i pass through macedonia for i do pass through macedonia the supplemental sentence for i do pass through macedonia imports that there had been some previous communication upon the subject of the journey and also that there had been some vacillation and indecisiveness in the apostles plan both which we now perceive to have been the case the sentence is as much as to say this is what i at last resolve upon the expression  is ambiguous it may denote either when i pass or when i shall have passed through macedonia the considerations offered above fix it to the latter sense lastly the point we have endeavored to make out confirms or rather indeed is necessary to the support of a conjecture which forms the subject of a number in our observations upon the first epistle that the insinuation of certain of the church of corinth that he would come no more amongst them was founded in some previous disappointment of their expectations  no v but if st paul had changed his purpose before the writing of the first epistle why did he defer explaining himself to the corinthians concerning the reason of that change until he wrote the second this is a very fair question and we are able i think to return to it a satisfactory answer the real cause and the cause at length assigned by st paul for postponing his visit to corinth and not traveling by the route which he had at first designed was the disorderly state of the corinthian church at the time and the painful severities which he should have found himself obliged to exercise if he had come amongst them during the existence of these irregularities he was willing therefore to try before he came in person what a letter of authoritative objurgation would do amongst them and to leave time for the operation of the experiment that was his scheme in writing the first epistle but it was not for him to acquaint them with the scheme after the epistle had produced its effect and to the utmost extent as it should seem of the apostles hopes when it had wrought in them a deep sense of their fault and an almost passionate solicitude to restore themselves to the approbation of their teacher when titus chap vii ver        had brought him intelligence of their earnest desire their mourning their fervent mind toward him of their sorrow and their penitence what carefulness what clearing of themselves what indignation what fear what vehement desire what zeal what revenge his letter and the general concern occasioned by it had excited amongst them he then opens himself fully upon the subject the affectionate mind of the apostle is touched by this return of zeal and duty he tells them that he did not visit them at the time proposed lest their meeting should have been attended with mutual grief and with grief to him embittered by the reflection that he was giving pain to those from whom alone he could receive comfort i determined this with myself that i would not come again to you in heaviness for if i make you sorry who is he that makes me glad but the same which is made sorry by me chap ii ver     that he had written his former epistle to warn them beforehand of their fault lest when he came he should have sorrow of them of whom he ought to rejoice chap ii ver   that he had the farther view though perhaps unperceived by them of making an experiment of their fidelity to know the proof of them whether they were obedient in all things chap ii ver   this full discovery of his motive came very naturally from the apostle after he had seen the success of his measures but would not have been a seasonable communication before the whole composes a train of sentiment and of conduct resulting from real situation and from real circumstance and as remote as possible from fiction or imposture  no vi chap xi ver   when i was present with you and wanted i was chargeable to no man for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from macedonia supplied the principal fact set forth in this passage the arrival at corinth of brethren from macedonia during st pauls first residence in that city is explicitly recorded acts chap xviii ver     after these things paul departed from athens and came to corinth and when silas and timotheus were come from macedonia paul was pressed in spirit and testified to the jews that jesus was christ  no vii the above quotation from the acts proves that silas and timotheus were assisting to st paul in preaching the gospel at corinth with which correspond the words of the epistle chap i ver    for the son of god jesus christ who was preached among you by us even by me and silvanus and timotheus was not yea and nay but in him was yea i do admit that the correspondency considered by itself is too direct and obvious and that an impostor with the history before him might and probably would produce agreements of the same kind but let it be remembered that this reference is found in a writing which from many discrepancies and especially from those noted no ii we may conclude was not composed by any one who had consulted and who pursued the history some observation also arises upon the variation of the name we read silas in the acts silvanus in the epistle the similitude of these two names if they were the names of different persons is greater than could easily have proceeded from accident i mean that it is not probable that two persons placed in situations so much alike should bear names so nearly resembling each other that they were the same person is farther confirmed by   thessalonians chap i ver   compared with acts chap xvii ver  0  on the other hand the difference of the name in the two passages negatives the supposition of the passages or the account contained in them being transcribed either from the other  no viii chap ii ver       when i came to troas to preach christs gospel and a door was opened unto me of the lord i had no rest in my spirit because i found not titus my brother but taking my leave of them i went from thence into macedonia  to establish a conformity between this passage and the history nothing more is necessary to be presumed than that st paul proceeded from ephesus to macedonia upon the same course by which he came back from macedonia to ephesus or rather to miletus in the neighborhood of ephesus in other words that in his journey to the peninsula of greece he went and returned the same way st paul is now in macedonia where he had lately arrived from ephesus our quotation imports that in his journey he had stopped at troas of this the history says nothing leaving us only the short account that paul departed from ephesus for to go into macedonia but the history says that in his return from macedonia to ephesus paul sailed from philippi to troas and that when the disciples came together on the first day of the week to break bread paul preached unto them all night that from troas he went by land to assos from assos taking ship and coasting along the front of asia minor he came by mytelene to miletus which account proves first that troas lay in the way by which st paul passed between ephesus and macedonia secondly that he had disciples there in one journey between these two places the epistle and in another journey between the same places the history makes him stop at this city of the first journey he is made to say that a door was in that city opened unto him of the lord in the second we find disciples there collected around him and the apostle exercising his ministry with what was even in him more than ordinary zeal and labor the epistle therefore is in this instance confirmed if not by the terms at least by the probability of the history a species of consirmation by no means to be despised because as far as it reaches it is evidently uncontrived  grotius i know refers the arrival at troas to which the epistle alludes to a different period but i think very improbably for nothing appears to me more certain than that the meeting with titus which st paul expected at troas was the same meeting which took place in macedonia viz upon tituss coming out of greece in the quotation before us he tells the corinthians when i came to troas i had no rest in my spirit because i found not titus my brother but taking my leave of them i went from thence into macedonia then in the seventh chapter he writes when we were come into macedonia our flesh had no rest but we were troubled on every side without were fightings within were fears nevertheless god that comfort them that are cast down comforted us by the coming of titus these two passages plainly relate to the same journey of titus in meeting with whom st paul had been disappointed at troas and rejoiced in macedonia and amongst other reasons which fix the former passage to the coming of titus out of greece is the consideration that it was nothing to the corinthians that st paul did not meet with titus at troas were it not that he was to bring intelligence from corinth the mention of the disappointment in this place upon any other supposition is irrelative  no ix chap xi ver       of the jews five times received i forty stripes save one thrice was i beaten with rods once was i stoned thrice i suffered shipwreck a night and a day i have been in the deep  these particulars cannot be extracted out of the acts of the apostles which proves as has been already observed that the epistle was not framed from the history yet they are consistent with it which considering how numerically circumstantial the account is is more than could happen to arbitrary and independent fictions when i say that these particulars are consistent with the history i mean first that there is no article in the enumeration which is contradicted by the history secondly that the history though silent with respect to many of the facts here enumerated has left space for the existence of these facts consistent with the sidelity of its own narration  first no contradiction is discoverable between the epistle and the history when st paul says thrice was i beaten with rods although the history record only one beating with rods viz at philippi acts chap xvi ver    yet is there no contradiction it is only the omission in one book of what is related in another but had the history contained accounts of four beatings with rods at the time of writing this epistle in which st paul says that he had only suffered three there would have been a contradiction properly so called the same observation applies generally to the other parts of the enumeration concerning which the history is silent but there is one clause in the quotation particularly deserving of remark because when confronted with the history it furnishes the nearest approach to a contradiction without a contradiction being actually incurred of any i remember to have met with once says st paul was i stoned does the history relate that st paul prior to the writing of this epistle had been stoned more than once the history mentions distinctly one occasion upon which st paul was stoned viz at lystra in lycaonia then came thither certain jews from antioch and iconium who persuaded the people and having stoned paul drew him out of the city supposing he had been dead chap xiv ver    and it mentions also another occasion in which an assault was made both of the gentiles and also of the jews with their rulers to use them despitefully and to stone them but they were aware of it the history proceeds to tell us and fled into lystra and derbe this happened at iconium prior to the date of the epistle now had the assault been completed had the history related that a stone was thrown as it relates that preparations were made both by jews and gentiles to stone paul and his companions or even had the account of this transaction stopped without going on to inform us that paul and his companions were aware of their danger and sled a contradiction between the history and the epistle would have ensued truth is necessarily consistent but it is scarcely possible that independent accounts not having truth to guide them should thus advance to the very brink of contradiction without falling into it  secondly i say that if the acts of the apostles be silent concerning many of the instances enumerated in the epistle this silence may be accounted for from the plan and fabric of the history the date of the epistle synchronises with the beginning of the twentieth chapter of the acts the part therefore of the history which precedes the twentieth chapter is the only part in which can be found any notice of the persecutions to which st paul refers now it does not appear that the author of the history was with st paul until his departure from troas on his way to macedonia as related chap xvi ver  0 or rather indeed the contrary appears it is in this point of the history that the language changes in the seventh and eighth verses of this chapter the third person is used after they were come to mysia they assayed to go into bithynia but the spirit suffered them not and they passing by mysia came to troas and the third person is in like manner constantly used throughout the foregoing part of the history in the tenth verse of this chapter the first person comes in after paul had seen the vision immediately we endeavored to go into macedonia assuredly gathering that the lord had called us to preach the gospel unto them now from this time to the writing of the epistle the history occupies four chapters yet it is in these if in any that a regular or continued account of the apostles life is to be expected for how succinctly his history is delivered in the preceding part of the book that is to say from the time of his conversion to the time when the historian joined him at troas except the particulars of his conversion itself which are related circumstantially may be understood from the following observations  the history of a period of sixteen years is comprised in less than three chapters and of these a material part is taken up with discourses after his conversion he continued in the neighborhood of damascus according to the history for a certain considerable though indefinite length of time according to his own words gal chapter i ver    for three years of which no other account is given than this short one that straightway he preached christ in the synagogues that he is the son of god that all that heard him were amazed and said is not this he that destroyed them which called on his name in jerusalem that he increased the more in strength and confounded the jews which dwelt at damascus and that after many days were fulfilled the jews took counsel to kill him from damascus he proceeded to jerusalem and of his residence there nothing more particular is recorded than that he was with the apostles coming in and going out that he spoke boldly in the name of the lord jesus and disputed against the grecians who went about to kill him from jerusalem the history sends him to his native city of tarsus acts chap ix ver  0  it seems probable from the order and disposition of the history that st pauls stay at tarsus was of some continuance for we hear nothing more of him until after a long apparent interval and much interjacent narrative barnabas desirous of pauls assistance upon the enlargement of the christian mission went to tarsus for to seek him chap xi ver     we cannot doubt but that the new apostle had been busied in his ministry yet of what he did or what he suffered during this period which may include three or four years the history professes not to deliver any information as tarsus was situated upon the sea coast and as though tarsus was his home yet it is probable he visited from thence many other places for the purpose of preaching the gospel it is not unlikely that in the course of three or four years he might undertake many short voyages to neighboring countries in the navigating of which we may be allowed to suppose that some of those disasters and shipwrecks befell him to which he refers in the quotation before us thrice i suffered shipwreck a night and a day i have been in the deep this last clause i am inclined to interpret of his being obliged to take to an open boat upon the loss of the ship and his continuing out at sea in that dangerous situation a night and a day st paul is here recounting his sufferings not relating miracles from tarsus barnabas brought paul to antioch and there he remained a year but of the transactions of that year no other description is given than what is contained in the four last verses of the eleventh chapter after a more solemn dedication to the ministry barnabas and paul proceeded from antioch to cilicia and from thence they sailed to cyprus of which voyage no particulars are mentioned upon their return from cyprus they made a progress together through the lesser asia and though two remarkable speeches be preserved and a few incidents in the course of their travels circumstantially related yet is the account of this progress upon the whole given professedly with conciseness for instance at iconium it is said that they abode a long time chap xiv ver    yet of this long abode except concerning the manner in which they were driven away no memoir is inserted in the history the whole is wrapped up in one short summary they spoke boldly in the lord which gave testimony unto the word of his grace and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands having completed their progress the two apostles returned to antioch and there they abode long time with the disciples here we have another large portion of time passed over in silence to this succeeded a journey to jerusalem upon a dispute which then much agitated the christian church concerning the obligation of the law of moses when the object of that journey was completed paul proposed to barnabas to go again and visit their brethren in every city where they had preached the word of the lord the execution of this plan carried our apostle through syria cilicia and many provinces of the lesser asia yet is the account of the whole journey dispatched in four verses of the sixteenth chapter  if the acts of the apostles had undertaken to exhibit regular annals of st pauls ministry or even any continued account of his life from his conversion at damascus to his imprisonment at rome i should have thought the omission of the circumstances referred to in our epistle a matter of reasonable objection but when it appears from the history itself that large portions of st pauls life were either passed over in silence or only slightly touched upon and that nothing more than certain detached incidents and discourses are related when we observe also that the author of the history did not join our apostles society till a few years before the writing of the epistle at least that there is no proof in the history that he did so in comparing the history with the epistle we shall not be surprised by the discovery of omissions we shall ascribe it to truth that there is no contradiction  no x chap iii ver   do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we as some others epistles of commendation to you  as some others turn to acts xviii    and you will find that a short time before the writing of this epistle apollos had gone to corinth with letters of commendations from the ephesian christians and when apollos was disposed to pass into achaia the brethren wrote exhorting the disciples to receive him here the words of the epistle bear the appearance of alluding to some specific instance and the history supplies that instance it supplies at least an instance as opposite as possible to the terms which the apostle uses and to the date and direction of the epistle in which they are found the letter which apollos carried from ephesus was precisely the letter of commendation which st paul meant and it was to achaia of which corinth was the capital and indeed to corinth itself acts chap xix ver   that apollos carried it and it was about two years before the writing of this epistle if st pauls words be rather thought to refer to some general usage which then obtained among christian churches the case of apollos exemplisies that usage and affords that species of confirmation to the epistle which arises from seeing the manners of the age in which it purports to be written faithfully preserved  no xi chap xiii ver   this is the third time i am coming to you   do not these words import that the writer had been at corinth twice before yet if they import this they overset every congruity we have been endeavoring to establish the acts of the apostles record only two journeys of st paul to corinth we have all along supposed what every mark of time except this expression indicates that the epistle was written between the first and second of these journeys if st paul had been already twice at corinth this supposition must be given up and every argument or observation which depends upon it falls to the ground again the acts of the apostles not only record no more than two journeys of st paul to corinth but do not allow us to suppose that more than two such journeys could be made or intended by him within the period which the history comprises for from his first journey into greece to his first imprisonment at rome with which the history concludes the apostles time is accounted for if therefore the epistle was written after the second journey to corinth and upon the view and expectation of a third it must have been written after his first imprisonment at rome i e after the time to which the history extends when i first read over this epistle with the particular view of comparing it with the history which i chose to do without consulting any commentary whatever i own that i felt myself confounded by this text it appeared to contradict the opinion which i had been led by a great variety of circumstances to form concerning the date and occasion of the epistle at length however it occurred to my thoughts to enquire whether the passage did necessarily imply that st paul had been at corinth twice or whether when he says this is the third time i am coming to you he might mean only that this was the third time that he was ready that he was prepared that he intended to set out upon his journey to corinth i recollected that he had once before this purposed to visit corinth and had been disappointed in his purpose which disappointment forms the subject of much apology and protestation in the first and second chapters of the epistle now if the journey in which he had been disappointed was reckoned by him one of the times in which he was coming to them then the present would be the third time i e of his being ready and prepared to come although he had been actually at corinth only once before this conjecture being taken up a farther examination of the passage and the epistle produced proofs which placed it beyond doubt this is the third time i am coming to you in the verse following these words he adds i told you before and foretell you as if i were present the second time and being absent now i write to them which heretofore have sinned and to all other that if i come again i will not spare in this verse the apostle is declaring beforehand what he would do in his intended visit his expression therefore as if i were present the second time relates to that visit but if his future visit would only make him present amongst them a second time it follows that he had been already there but once again in the fifteenth verse of the first chapter he tells them in this confidence i was minded to come unto you before that you might have a second benefit why a second and not a third benefit why  and not  if the  in the fifteenth chapter meant a third visit for though the visit in the first chapter be that visit in which he was disappointed yet as it is evident from the epistle that he had never been at corinth from the time of the disappointment to the time of writing the epistle it follows that if it was only a second visit in which he was disappointed then it could only be a second visit which he proposed now but the text which i think is decisive of the question if any question remain upon the subject is the fourteenth verse of the twelfth chapter behold the third time i am ready to come to you  it is very clear that the  of the twelfth chapter and the  of the thirteenth chapter are equivalent expressions were intended to convey the same meaning and to relate to the same journey the comparison of these phrases gives us st pauls own explanation of his own words and it is that very explanation which we are contending for viz that  does not mean that he was coming a third time but that this was the third time he was in readiness to come  i do not apprehend that after this it can be necessary to call to our aid the reading of the alexandrian manuscript which gives  in the thirteenth chapter as well as in the twelfth or of the syriac and coptic versions which follow that reading because i allow that this reading besides not being sufficiently supported by ancient copies is probably paraphrastical and has been inserted for the purpose of expressing more unequivocally the sense which the shorter expression  was supposed to carry upon the whole the matter is sufficiently certain nor do i propose it as a new interpretation of the text which contains the difficulty for the same was given by grotius long ago but i thought it the clearest way of explaining the subject to describe the manner in which the difficulty the solution and the proofs of that solution successively presented themselves to my enquiries now in historical researches a reconciled inconsistency becomes a positive argument first because an impostor generally guards against the appearance of inconsistency and secondly because when apparent inconsistencies are found it is seldom that any thing but truth renders them capable of reconciliation the existence of the difficulty proves the want or absence of that caution which usually accompanies the consciousness of fraud and the solution proves that it is not the collision of fortuitous propositions which we have to deal with but that a thread of truth winds through the whole which preserves every circumstance in its place  no xii chap x ver      we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of christ not boasting of things without our measure that is of other mens labors but having hope when your faith is increased that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you  this quotation affords an indirect and therefore unsuspicious but at the same time a distinct and indubitable recognition of the truth and exactness of the history i consider it to be implied by the words of the quotation that corinth was the extremity of st pauls travels hitherto he expresses to the corinthians his hope that in some future visit he might preach the gospel to the regions beyond them which imports that he had not hitherto proceeded beyond them but that corinth was as yet the farthest point or boundary of his travels now how is st pauls first journey into europe which was the only one he had taken before the writing of the epistle traced out in the history sailing from asia he landed at philippi from philippi traversing the eastern coast of the peninsula he passed through amphipolis and apollonia to thessalonica from thence through berea to athens and from athens to corinth where he stopped and from whence after a residence of a year and a half he sailed back into syria so that corinth was the last place which he visited in the peninsula was the place from which he returned into asia and was as such the boundary and limit of his progress he could not have said the same thing viz i hope hereafter to visit the regions beyond you in an epistle to the philippians or in an epistle to the thessalonians inasmuch as he must be deemed to have already visited the regions beyond them having proceeded from those cities to other parts of greece but from corinth he returned home every part therefore beyond that city might properly be said as it is said in the passage before us to be unvisited yet is this propriety the spontaneous effect of truth and produced without meditation or design  chap v the epistle to the galatians no i the argument of this epistle in some measure proves its antiquity it will hardly be doubted but that it was written whilst the dispute concerning the circumcision of gentile converts was fresh in mens minds for even supposing it to have been a forgery the only credible motive that can be assigned for the forgery was to bring the name and authority of the apostle into this controversy no design could be so insipid or so unlikely to enter into the thoughts of any man as to produce an epistle written earnestly and pointedly upon one side of a controversy when the controversy itself was dead and the question no longer interesting to any description of readers whatever now the controversy concerning the circumcision of the gentile christians was of such a nature that if it arose at all it must have arisen in the beginning of christianity as judaea was the scene of the christian history as the author and preachers of christianity were jews as the religion itself acknowledged and was founded upon the jewish religion in contradistinction to every other religion then professed amongst mankind it was not to be wondered at that some of its teachers should carry it out in the world rather as a sect and modification of judaism than as a separate original revelation or that they should invite their proselytes to those observances in which they lived themselves this was likely to happen but if it did not happen at first if whilst the religion was in the hands of jewish teachers no such claim was advanced no such condition was attempted to be imposed it is not probable that the doctrine would be started much less that it should prevail in any future period i likewise think that those pretensions of judaism were much more likely to be insisted upon whilst the jews continued a nation than after their fall and dispersion whilst jerusalem and the temple stood than after the destruction brought upon them by the roman arms the fatal cessation of the sacrifice and the priesthood the humiliating loss of their country and with it of the great rites and symbols of their institution it should seem therefore from the nature of the subject and the situation of the parties that this controversy was carried on in the interval between the preaching of christianity to the gentiles and the invasion of titus and that our present epistle which was undoubtedly intended to bear a part in this controversy must be referred to the same period  but again the epistle supposes that certain designing adherents of the jewish law had crept into the churches of galatia and had been endeavoring and but too successfully to persuade the galatic converts that they had been taught the new religion imperfectly and at second hand that the founder of their church himself possessed only an inferior and deputed commission the seat of truth and authority being in the apostles and elders of jerusalem moreover that whatever he might profess amongst them he had himself at other times and in other places given way to the doctrine of circumcision  the epistle is unintelligible without supposing all this referring therefore to this as to what had actually passed we find st paul treating so unjust an attempt to undermine his credit and to introduce amongst his converts a doctrine which he had uniformly reprobated in terms of great asperity and indignation and in order to refute the suspicions which had been raised concerning the fidelity of his teaching as well as to assert the independency and divine original of his mission we find him appealing to the history of his conversion to his conduct under it to the manner in which he had conferred with the apostles when he met with them at jerusalem alleging that so far was his doctrine from being derived from them or they from exercising any superiority over him that they had simply assented to what he had already preached amongst the gentiles and which preaching was communicated not by them to him but by himself to them that he had maintained the liberty of the gentile church by opposing upon one occasion an apostle to the face when the timidity of his behavior seemed to endanger it that from the first that all along that to that hour he had constantly resisted the claims of judaism and that the persecutions which he daily underwent at the hands or by the instigation of the jews and of which he bore in his person the marks and scars might have been avoided by him if he had consented to employ his labors in bringing through the medium of christianity converts over to the jewish institution for then would the offense of the cross have ceased now an impostor who had forged the epistle for the purpose of producing st pauls authority in the dispute which as has been observed is the only credible motive that can be assigned for the forgery might have made the apostle deliver his opinion upon the subject in strong and decisive terms or might have put his name to a train of reasoning and argumentation upon that side of the question which the imposture was intended to recommend i can allow the possibility of such a scheme as that but for a writer with this purpose in view to feign a series of transactions supposed to have passed amongst the christians of galatia and then to counterfeit expressions of anger and resentment excited by these transactions to make the apostle travel back into his own history and into a recital of various passages of his life some indeed directly but others obliquely and others even obscurely bearing upon the point in question in a word to substitute narrative for argument expostulation and complaint for dogmatic positions and controversial reasoning in a writing properly controversial and of which the aim and design was to support one side of a much agitated question  is a method so intricate and so unlike the methods pursued by all other impostors as to require very flagrant proofs of imposition to induce us to believe it to be one  no ii in this number i shall endeavor to prove    that the epistle to the galatians and the acts of the apostles were written without any communication with each other    that the epistle though written without any communication with the history by recital implication or reference bears testimony to many of the facts contained in it  i the epistle and the acts of the apostles were written without any communication with each other  to judge of this point we must examine those passages in each which describe the same transaction for if the author of either writing derived his information from the account which he had seen in the other when he came to speak of the same transaction he would follow that account the history of st paul at damascus as read in the acts and as referred to by the epistle forms an instance of this sort according to the acts paul after his conversion was certain days with the disciples which were at damascus and straightway he preached christ in the synagogues that he is the son of god but all that heard him were amazed and said is not this he which destroyed them which called on this name in jerusalem and came hither for that intent that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests but saul increased the more in strength confounding the jews which were at damascus proving that this is the very christ and after many days were fulfilled the jews took counsel to kill him but their laying in wait was known of saul and they watched the gates day and night to kill him then the disciples took him by night and let him down by the wall in a basket and when saul was come to jerusalem he assayed to join himself to the disciples acts chap ix ver       according to the epistle when it pleased god who separated me from my mothers womb and called me by his grace to reveal his own son in me that i might preach him among the heathen immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood neither went i up to jerusalem to them which were apostles before me but i went into arabia and returned again to damascus then after three years i went up to jerusalem  beside the difference observable in the terms and general complexion of these two accounts the journey into arabia mentioned in the epistle and omitted in the history affords full proof that there existed no correspondence between these writers if the narrative in the acts had been made up from the epistle it is impossible that this journey should have been passed over in silence if the epistle had been composed out of what the author had read of st pauls history in the acts it is unaccountable that it should have been inserted n b the acts of the apostles simply inform us that st paul left damascus in order to go to jerusalem after many days were fulfilled if any one doubt whether the words many days could be intended to express a period which included a term of three years he will find a complete instance of the same phrase used with the same latitude in the first book of kings chap xi ver       and shimei dwelt at jerusalem many days and it came to pass at the end of three years that two of the servants of shimei ran away   the journey to jerusalem related in the second chapter of the epistle then fourteen years after i went up again to jerusalem supplies another example of the same kind either this was the journey described in the fifteenth chapter of the acts when paul and barnabas were sent from antioch to jerusalem to consult the apostles and elders upon the question of the gentile converts or it was some journey of which the history does not take notice if the first opinion be followed the discrepancy in the two accounts is so considerable that it is not without difficulty they can be adapted to the same transaction so that upon this supposition there is no place for suspecting that the writers were guided or assisted by each other if the latter opinion be preferred we have then a journey to jerusalem and a conference with the principal members of the church there circumstantially related in the epistle and entirely omitted in the acts and we are at liberty to repeat the observation which we before made that the omission of so material a fact in the history is inexplicable if the historian had read the epistle and that the insertion of it in the epistle if the writer derived his information from the history is not less so  st peters visit to antioch during which the dispute arose between him and st paul is not mentioned in the acts  if we connect with these instances the general observation that no scrutiny can discover the smallest trace of transcription or imitation either in things or words we shall be fully satisfied in this part of our case namely that the two records be the facts contained in them true or false come to our hands from independent sources  secondly i say that the epistle thus proved to have been written without any communication with the history bears testimony to a great variety of particulars contained in the history    st paul in the early part of his life had addicted himself to the study of the jewish religion and was distinguished by his zeal for the institution and for the traditions which had been incorporated with it upon this part of his character the history makes st paul speak thus i am verily a man which am a jew born in tarsus a city of cilicia yet brought up in this city at the feet of gamaliel and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers and was zealous toward god as ye all are this day acts chap xxii ver    the epistle as follows i profited in the jews religion above many my equals in mine own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers chap i ver       st paul before his conversion had been a fierce persecutor of the new sect as for saul he made havoc of the church entering into every house and haling men and women committed them to prison acts chap vii ver    this is the history of st paul as delivered in the acts in the recital of his own history in the epistle ye have heard says he of my conversation in times past in the jews religion how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god chap i ver       st paul was miraculously converted on his way to damascus and as he journeyed he came near to damascus and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven and he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him saul saul why persecutest thou me and he said who art thou lord and the lord said i am jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks and he trembling and astonished said lord what will thou have me to do acts chap ix ver    with this compare the epistle chap i ver      when it pleased god who separated me from my mothers womb and called me by his grace to reveal his son in me that i might preach him among the heathen immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood neither went i up to jerusalem to them that were apostles before me but i went into arabia and returned again unto damascus  in this quotation from the epistle i desire it to be remarked how incidentally it appears that the affair passed at damascus in what may be called the direct part of the account no mention is made of the place of his conversion at all a casual expression at the end and an expression brought in for a different purpose alone fixes it to have been at damascus i returned again to damascus nothing can be more like simplicity and undesignedness than this is it also draws the agreement between the two quotations somewhat closer to observe that they both state st paul to have preached the gospel immediately upon his call and straightway he preached christ in the synagogues that he is the son of god acts chap ix ver  0 when it pleased god to reveal his son in me that i might preach him among the heathen immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood gal chap i ver       the course of the apostles travels after his conversion was this  he went from damascus to jerusalem and from jerusalem into syria and cilicia at damascus the disciples took him by night and let him down by the wall in a basket and when saul was come to jerusalem he assayed to join himself to the disciples acts chap ix ver    afterward when the brethren knew the conspiracy formed against him at jerusalem they brought him down to caesarea and sent him forth to tarsus a city in cilicia chap ix ver  0 in the epistle st paul gives the following brief account of his proceedings within the same period after three years i went up to jerusalem to see peter and abode with him fifteen days afterward i came into the regions of syria and cilicia the history had told us that paul passed from caesarea to tarsus if he took this journey by land it would carry him through syria into cilicia and he would come after his visit at jerusalem into the regions of syria and cilicia in the very order in which he mentions them in the epistle this supposition of his going from caesarea to tarsus by land clears up also another point it accounts for what st paul says in the same place concerning the churches of judea afterward i came into the regions of syria and cilicia and was unknown by face unto the churches of judea which were in christ but they had heard only that he which persecuted us in times past now preaches the faith which once he destroyed and they glorified god in me upon which passage i observe first that what is here said of the churches of judea is spoken in connection with his journey into the regions of syria and cilicia secondly that the passage itself has little significancy and that the connection is inexplicable unless st paul went through judea dr doddridge thought that the caesarea here mentioned was not the celebrated city of that name upon the mediterranean sea but caesarea philippi near the borders of syria which lies in a much more direct line from jerusalem to tarsus than the other the objection to this dr benson remarks is that caesarea without any addition usually denotes caesarea palestinae though probably by a hasty journey at the time that he came into the regions of syria and cilicia suppose him to have passed by land from caesarea to tarsus all this as has been observed would be precisely true    barnabas was with paul at antioch then departed barnabas to tarsus for to seek saul and when he had found him he brought him unto antioch and it came to pass that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church acts chap xi ver       again and upon another occasion they paul and barnabas sailed to antioch and there they continued a long time with the disciples chap xiv ver     now what says the epistle when peter was come to antioch i withstood him to the face because he was to be blamed and the other jews dissembled likewise with him insomuch that barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation chap ii ver          the stated residence of the apostles was at jerusalem at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at jerusalem and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of judea and samaria except the apostles acts chap viii ver   they the christians at antioch determined that paul and barnabas should go up to jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question acts chap xv ver   with these accounts agrees the declaration in the epistle neither went i up to jerusalem to them which were apostles before me chap i ver    for this declaration implies or rather assumes it to be known that jerusalem was the place where the apostles were to be met with    there were at jerusalem two apostles or at the least two eminent members of the church of the name of james this is directly inferred from the acts of the apostles which in the second verse of the twelfth chapter relates the death of james the brother of john and yet in the fifteenth chapter and in a subsequent part of the history records a speech delivered by james in the assembly of the apostles and elders it is also strongly implied by the form of expression used in the epistle other apostles saw i none save james the lords brother i e to distinguish him from james the brother of john  to us who have been long conversant in the christian history as contained in the acts of the apostles these points are obvious and familiar nor do we readily apprehend any greater difficulty in making them appear in a letter purporting to have been written by st paul than there is in introducing them into a modern sermon but to judge correctly of the argument before us we must discharge this knowledge from our thoughts we must propose to ourselves the situation of an author who sat down to the writing of the epistle without having seen the history and then the concurrences we have deduced will be deemed of importance they will at least be taken for separate confirmations of the several facts and not only of these particular facts but of the general truth of the history  for what is the rule with respect to corroborative testimony which prevails in courts of justice and which prevails only because experience has proved that it is an useful guide to truth a principal witness in a cause delivers his account his narrative in certain parts of it is confirmed by witnesses who are called afterward the credit derived from their testimony belongs not only to the particular circumstances in which the auxiliary witnesses agree with the principal witness but in some measure to the whole of his evidence because it is improbable that accident or fiction should draw a line which touched upon truth in so many points  in like manner if two records be produced manifestly independent that is manifestly written without any participation of intelligence an agreement between them even in few and slight circumstances especially if from the different nature and design of the writings few points only of agreement and those incidental could be expected to occur would add a sensible weight to the authority of both in every part of their contents  the same rule is applicable to history with at least as much reason as any other species of evidence  no iii but although the references to various particulars in the epistle compared with the direct account of the same particulars in the history afford a considerable proof of the truth not only of these particulars but of the narrative which contains them yet they do not show it will be said that the epistle was written by st paul for admitting what seems to have been proved that the writer whoever he was had no recourse to the acts of the apostles yet many of the facts referred to such as st pauls miraculous conversion his change from a virulent persecutor to an indefatigable preacher his labors amongst the gentiles and his zeal for the liberties of the gentile church were so notorious as to occur readily to the mind of any christian who should choose to personate his character and counterfeit his name it was only to write what every body knew now i think that this supposition  viz that the epistle was composed upon general information and the general publicity of the facts alluded to and that the author did no more than weave into his work what the common fame of the christian church had reported to his ears  is repelled by the particularity of the recitals and references this particularity is observable in the following instances in perusing which i desire the reader to reflect whether they exhibit the language of a man who had nothing but general reputation to proceed upon or of a man actually speaking of himself and of his own history and consequently of things concerning which he possessed a clear intimate and circumstantial knowledge    the history in giving an account of st paul after his conversion relates that after many days effecting by the assistance of the disciples his escape from damascus he proceeded to jerusalem acts chap ix ver    the epistle speaking of the same period makes st paul say that he went into arabia that he returned again to damascus that after three years he went up to jerusalem chap i ver          the history relates that when saul was come from damascus he was with the disciples coming in and going out acts chap ix ver    the epistle describing the same journey tells us that he went up to jerusalem to see peter and abode with him fifteen days chap i ver       the history relates that when paul was come to jerusalem barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles acts chap ix ver    the epistle that he saw peter but other of the apostles saw he none save james the lords brother chap i ver     now this is as it should be the historian delivers his account in general terms as of facts to which he was not present the person who is the subject of that account when he comes to speak of these facts himself particularizes time names and circumstances    the like notation of places persons and dates is met with in the account of st pauls journey to jerusalem given in the second chapter of the epistle it was fourteen years after his conversion it was in company with barnabas and titus it was then that he met with james cephas and john it was then also that it was agreed amongst them that they should go to the circumcision and he unto the gentiles    the dispute with peter which occupies the sequel of the second chapter is marked with the same particularity it was at antioch it was after certain came from james it was whilst barnabas was there who was carried away by their dissimulation these examples negative the insinuation that the epistle presents nothing but indefinite allusions to public facts  no iv chap iv ver      i am afraid of you lest i have bestowed upon you labor in vain brethren i beseech you be as i am for i am as ye are ye have not injured me at all ye know how through infirmity of the flesh i preached the gospel unto you at the first and my temptation which was in the flesh ye despised not nor rejected but received me as an angel of god even as christ jesus where is then the blessedness you spoke of for i bear you record that if it had been possible ye would have plucked out your own eyes and have given them unto me am i therefore become your enemy because i tell you the truth  with this passage compare   cor chap xii ver    it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory i will come to visions and revelations of the lord i knew a man in christ above fourteen years ago whether in the body i cannot tell or whether out of the body i cannot tell god knows such a one was caught up to the third heaven and i knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body i cannot tell god knows how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter of such an one will i glory yet of myself will i not glory but in mine infirmities for though i would desire to glory i shall not be a fool for i will say the truth but now i forbear lest any man should think of me above that which he sees me to be or that he hears of me and lest i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of satan to buffet me lest i should be exalted above measure for this thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me  there can be no doubt but that the temptation which was in the flesh mentioned in the epistle to the galatians and the thorn in the flesh the messenger of satan to buffet him mentioned in the epistle to the corinthians were intended to denote the same thing either therefore it was what we pretend it to have been the same person in both alluding as the occasion led him to some bodily infirmity under which he labored that is we are reading the real letters of a real apostle or it was that a sophist who had seen this circumstance in one epistle contrived for the sake of correspondency to bring it into another or lastly it was a circumstance in st pauls personal condition supposed to be well known to those into whose hands the epistle was likely to fall and for that reason introduced into a writing designed to bear his name i have extracted the quotations at length in order to enable the reader to judge accurately of the manner in which the mention of this particular comes in in each because that judgment i think will acquit the authors of the epistle of the charge of having studiously inserted it either with a view of producing an apparent agreement between them or for any other purpose whatever  the context by which the circumstance before us in introduced is in the two places totally different and without any mark of imitation yet in both places does the circumstance rise aptly and naturally out of the context and that context from the train of thought carried on in the epistle  the epistle to the galatians from the beginning to the end runs in a strain of angry complaint of their defection from the apostle and from the principles which he had taught them it was very natural to contrast with this conduct the zeal with which they had once received him and it was not less so to mention as a proof of their former disposition toward him the indulgence which whilst he was amongst them they had shown to his infirmity my temptation which was in the flesh ye despised not nor rejected but received me as an angel of god even as christ jesus where is then the blessedness you spoke of i e the benedictions which you bestowed upon me for i bear you record that if it had been possible ye would have plucked out your own eyes and have given them to me  in the two epistles to the corinthians especially in the second we have the apostle contending with certain teachers in corinth who had formed a party in that church against him to vindicate his personal authority as well as the dignity and credit of his ministry amongst them he takes occasion but not without apologizing repeatedly for the folly that is for the indecorum of pronouncing his own panegyric would to god you would bear with me a little in my folly and indeed bear with me chap xi ver    that which i speak i speak it not after the lord but as it were foolishly in this confidence of boasting chap xi ver     i am become a fool in glorying ye have compelled me chap xii ver       to meet his adversaries in their boastings whereinsoever any is bold i speak foolishly i am bold also are they hebrews so am i are they israelites so am i are they the seed of abraham so am i are they the ministers of christ i speak as a fool i am more in labors more abundant in stripes above measure in prisons more frequent in deaths ost being thus led to the subject he goes on as was natural to recount his trials and dangers his incessant cares and labors in the christian mission from the proofs which he had given of his zeal and activity in the service of christ he passes and that with the same view of establishing his claim to be considered as not a whit behind the very chiefest of the apostels to the visions and revelations which from time to time had been vouchsafed to him and then by a close and easy connection comes in the mention of his insirmity lest i should be exalted says he above measure through the abundance of revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of satan to buffet me  thus then in both epistles the notice of his infirmity is suited to the place in which it is found in the epistle to the corinthians the train of thought draws up to the circumstance by a regular approximation in the epistle it is suggested by the subject and occasion of the epistle itself which observation we offer as an argument to prove that it is not in either epistle a circumstance industriously brought forward for the sake of procuring credit to an imposture  a reader will be taught to perceive the force of this argument who shall attempt to introduce a given circumstance into the body of a writing to do this without abruptness or without betraying marks of design in the transition requires he will find more art than he expected to be necessary certainly more than any one can believe to have been exercised in the composition of these epistles  no v chap iv ver    but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so is it now  chap v ver    and i brethren if i yet preach circumcision why do i yet suffer persecution then is the offense of the cross ceased  chap vi ver    from henceforth let no man trouble me for i bear in my body the marks of the lord jesus  from these several texts it is apparent that the persecutions which our apostle had undergone were from the hands or by the instigation of the jews that it was not for preaching christianity in opposition to heathenism but it was for preaching it as distinct from judaism that he had brought upon himself the sufferings which had attended his ministry and this representation perfectly coincides with that which results from the detail of st pauls history as delivered in the acts at antioch in pisidia the word of the lord was published throughout all the region but the jews stirred up the devout and honorable women and the chief men of the city and raised persecution against paul and barnabas and expelled them out of their coasts acts chap xiii ver  0 not long after at iconium a great multitude of the jews and also of the greeks believed but the unbelieving jews stirred up the gentiles and made their minds evil affected against the brethren chap xiv ver     at lystra there came certain jews from antioch and iconium who persuaded the people and having stoned paul drew him out of the city supposing he had been dead chap xiv ver    the same enmity and from the same quarter our apostle experienced in greece at thessalonica some of them the jews believed and consorted with paul and silas and of the devout greeks a great multitude and of the chief women not a few but the jews which believed not moved with envy took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort and gathered a company and set all the city in an uproar and assaulted the house of jason and sought to bring them out to the people acts chap xvii ver     their persecutors follow them to beraea when the jews of thessalonica had knowledge that the word of god was preached of st paul at beraea they came thither also and stirred up the people chap xvii ver    and lastly at corinth when gallio was deputy of achaia  the jews made insurrection with one accord against paul and brought him to the judgment seat i think it does not appear that our apostle was ever set upon by the gentiles unless they were first stirred up by the jews except in two instances in both which the persons who began the assault were immediately interested in his expulsion from the place once this happened at philippi after the cure of the pythoness when the masters saw the hope of their gains was gone they caught paul and silas and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers chap xvi ver    and a second time at ephesus at the instance of demetrius a silversmith which made silver shrines for diana who called together workmen of like occupation and said sirs ye know that by this craft we have our wealth moreover ye see and hear that not only at ephesus but almost throughout all asia this paul has persuaded away much people saying that they be no gods which are made with hands so that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at naught but also that the temple of the great goddess diana should be despised and her magnificence should be destroyed whom all asia and the world worshippeth  no vi i observe an agreement in a somewhat peculiar rule of christian conduct as laid down in this epistle and as exemplified in the second epistle to the corinthians it is not the repetition of the same general precept which would have been a coincidence of little value but it is the general precept in one place and the application of that precept to an actual occurrence in the other in the sixth chapter and first verse of this epistle our apostle gives the following direction brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness in   cor chap ii ver    he writes thus sufficient to such a man the incestuous person mentioned in the first epistle is this punishment which was inflicted of many so that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him and comfort him lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow wherefore i beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him i have little doubt but that it was the same mind which dictated these two passages  no vii our epistle goes farther than any of st pauls epistles for it avows in direct terms the supersession of the jewish law as an instrument of salvation even to the jews themselves not only were the gentiles exempt from its authority but even the jews were no longer either to place any dependency upon it or consider themselves as subject to it on a religious account before faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterward be revealed wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto christ that we might be justified by faith but after that faith is come we are no longer under a schoolmaster chapter iii ver       this was undoubtedly spoken of jews and to jews in like manner chap iv ver    now i say that the heir as long as he is a child differs nothing from a servant though he be lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons these passages are nothing short of a declaration that the obligation of the jewish law considered as a religious dispensation the effects of which were to take place in another life had ceased with respect even to the jews themselves what then should be the conduct of a jew for such st paul was who preached this doctrine to be consistent with himself either he would no longer comply in his own person with the directions of the law or if he did comply it would be for some other reason than any considence which he placed in its efficacy as a religious institution now so it happens that whenever st pauls compliance with the jewish law is mentioned in the history it is mentioned in connection with circumstances which point out the motive from which it proceeded and this motive appears to have been always exoteric namely a love of order and tranquillity or an unwillingness to give unnecessary offense thus acts chap xvi ver   him timothy would paul have to go forth with him and took and circumcised him because of the jews which were in those quarters again acts chap xxi ver    when paul consented to exhibit an example of public compliance with a jewish rite by purifying himself in the temple it is plainly intimated that he did this to satisfy many thousand of jews who believed and who were all zealous of the law so far the instances related in one book correspond with the doctrine delivered in another  no viii chap i ver    then after three years i went up to jerusalem to see peter and abode with him fifteen days  the shortness of st pauls stay at jerusalem is what i desire the reader to remark the direct account of the same journey in the acts chap ix ver    determines nothing concerning the time of his continuance there and he was with them the apostles coming in and going out at jerusalem and he spoke boldly in the name of the lord jesus and disputed against the grecians but they went about to slay him which when the brethren knew they brought him down to caesarea or rather this account taken by itself would lead a reader to suppose that st pauls abode at jerusalem had been longer than fifteen days but turn to the twentysecond chapter of the acts and you will find a reference to this visit to jerusalem which plainly indicates that pauls continuance in that city had been of short duration and it came to pass that when i was come again to jerusalem even while i prayed in the temple i was in a trance and saw him saying unto me make haste get thee quickly out of jerusalem for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me here we have the general terms of one text so explained by a distant text in the same book as to bring an indeterminate expression into close conformity with a specification delivered in another book a species of consistency not i think usually found in fabulous relations  no ix chap vi ver    ye see how large a letter i have written unto you with mine own hand  these words imply that he did not always write with his own hand which is consonant to what we find intimated in some other of the epistles the epistle to the romans was written by tertius i tertius who wrote this epistle salute you in the lord chap xvi ver    the first epistle to the corinthians the epistle to the colossians and the second to the thessalonians have all near the conclusion this clause the salutation of me paul with mine own hand which must be understood and is universally understood to import that the rest of the epistle was written by another hand i do not think it improbable that an impostor who had remarked this subscription in some other epistle should invent the same in a forgery but that is not done here the author of this epistle does not imitate the manner of giving st pauls signature he only bids the galatians observe how large a letter he had written to them with his own hand he does not say this was different from his ordinary usage that is left to implication now to suppose that this was an artifice to procure credit to an imposture is to suppose that the author of the forgery because he knew that others of st pauls were not written by himself therefore made the apostle say that this was which seems an odd turn to give to the circumstance and to be given for a purpose which would more naturally and more directly have been answered by subjoining the salutation or signature in the form in which it is found in other epistles the words  may probably be meant to describe the character in which he wrote and not the length of the letter but this will not alter the truth of our observation i think however that as st paul by the mention of his own hand designed to express to the galatians the great concern which he felt for them the words whatever they signify belong to the whole of the epistle and not as grotius after st jerome interprets it to the few verses which follow   no x an exact conformity appears in the manner in which a certain apostle or eminent christian whose name was james is spoken of in the epistle and in the history both writings refer to a situation of his at jerusalem somewhat different from that of the other apostles a kind of eminence or presidency in the church there or at least a more fixed and stationary residence chap ii ver    when peter was at antioch before that certain came from james he did eat with the gentiles this text plainly attributes a kind of preeminency to james and as we hear of him twice in the same epistle dwelling at jerusalem chap i ver    and ii   we must apply it to the situation which he held in that church in the acts of the apostles diverse intimations occur conveying the same idea of jamess situation when peter was miraculously delivered from prison and had surprised his friends by his appearance among them after declaring unto them how the lord had brought him out of prison go show says he these things unto james and to the brethren acts chap xii ver    here james is manifestly spoken of in terms of distinction he appears again with like distinction in the twentyfirst chapter and the seventeenth and eighteenth verses and when we paul and his company were come to jerusalem the day following paul went in with us unto james and all the elders were present in the debate which took place upon the business of the gentile converts in the council at jerusalem this same person seems to have taken the lead it was he who closed the debate and proposed the resolution in which the council ultimately concurred wherefore my sentence is that we trouble not them which from among the gentiles are turned to god  upon the whole that there exists a conformity in the expressions used concerning james throughout the history and in the epistle is unquestionable but admitting this conformity and admitting also the undesignedness of it what does it prove it proves that the circumstance itself is founded in truth that is that james was a real person who held a situation of eminence in a real society of christians at jerusalem it confirms also those parts of the narrative which are connected with this circumstance suppose for instance the truth of the account of peters escape from prison was to be tried upon the testimony of a witness who amongst other things made peter after his deliverance say go show these things to james and to the brethren would it not be material in such a trial to make out by other independent proofs or by a comparison of proofs drawn from independent sources that there was actually at that time living at jerusalem such a person as james that this person held such a situation in the society amongst whom these things were transacted as to render the words which peter is said to have used concerning him proper and natural for him to have used if this would be pertinent in the discussion of oral testimony it is still more so in appreciating the credit of remote history  it must not be dissembled that the comparison of our epistle with the history presents some difficulties or to say the least some questions of considerable magnitude it may be doubted in the first place to what journey the words which open the second chapter of the epistle then fourteen years afterward i went unto jerusalem relate that which best corresponds with the date and that to which most interpreters apply the passage is the journey of paul and barnabas to jerusalem when they went thither from antioch upon the business of the gentile converts and which journey produced the famous council and decree recorded in the fifteenth chapter of acts to me this opinion appears to be encumbered with strong objections in the epistle paul tells us that he went up by revelation chap ii ver   in the acts we read that he was sent by the church of antioch after no small dissension and disputation they determined that paul and barnabas and certain other of them should go up to the apostles and elders about this question acts chap xv ver   this is not very reconcilable in the epistle st paul writes that when he came to jerusalem he communicated that gospel which he preached among the gentiles but privately to them which were of reputation chap ii ver   if by that gospel be meant the immunity of the gentile christians from the jewish law and i know not what else it can mean it is not easy to conceive how he should communicate that privately which was the subject of his public message but a yet greater difficulty remains viz that in the account which the epistle gives of what passed upon this visit at jerusalem no notice is taken of the deliberation and decree which are recorded in the acts and which according to that history formed the business for the sake of which the journey was undertaken the mention of the council and of its determination whilst the apostle was relating his proceedings at jerusalem could hardly have been avoided if in truth the narrative belong to the same journey to me it appears more probable that paul and barnabas had taken some journey to jerusalem the mention of which is omitted in the acts prior to the apostolic decree we read that paul and barnabas abode at antioch a long time with the disciples acts chap xiv ver    is it is unlikely that during this long abode they might go up to jerusalem and return to antioch or would the omission of such a journey be unsuitable to the general brevity with which these memoirs are written especially of those parts of st pauls history which took place before the historian joined his society  but again the first account we find in the acts of the apostles of st pauls visiting galatia is in the sixteenth chapter and the sixth verse now when they had gone through phrygia and the region of galatia they assayed to go into bithynia the progress here recorded was subsequent to the apostolic decree therefore that decree must have been extant when our epistle was written now as the professed design of the epistle was to establish the exemption of the gentile converts from the law of moses and as the decree pronounced and confirmed that exemption it may seem extraordinary that no notice whatever is taken of that determination nor any appeal made to its authority much however of the weight of this objection which applies also to some other of st pauls epistles is removed by the following reflections    it was not st pauls manner nor agreeable to it to resort or defer much to the authority of the other apostles especially whilst he was insisting as he does strenuously throughout this epistle insist upon his own original inspiration he who could speak of the very chiefest of the apostles in such terms as the following  of those who seemed to be somewhat whatsoever they were it makes no matter to me god accepts no mans person for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me  he i say was not likely to support himself by their decision    the epistle argues the point upon principle and it is not perhaps more to be wondered at that in such an argument st paul should not cite the apostolic decree than it would be that in a discourse designed to prove the moral and religious duty of observing the sabbath the writer should not quote the thirteenth canon    the decree did not go the length of the position maintained in the epistle the decree only declares that the apostles and elders at jerusalem did not impose the observance of the mosaic law upon the gentile converts as a condition of their being admitted into the christian church our epistle argues that the mosaic institution itself was at an end as to all effects upon a future state even with respect to the jews themselves    they whose error st paul combatted were not persons who submitted to the jewish law because it was imposed by the authority or because it was made part of the law of the christian church but they were persons who having already become christians afterward voluntarily took upon themselves the observance of the mosaic code under a notion of attaining thereby to a greater perfection this i think is precisely the opinion which st paul opposes in this epistle many of his expressions apply exactly to it are ye so foolish having begun in the spirit are ye now made perfect in the flesh chap iii ver   tell me ye that desire to be under the law do ye not hear the law chap iv ver    how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage chap iv ver   it cannot be thought extraordinary that st paul should resist this opinion with earnestness for it both changed the character of the christian dispensation and derogated expressly from the completeness of that redemption which jesus christ had wrought for them that believed in him but it was to no purpose to allege to such persons the decision at jerusalem for that only showed that they were not bound to these observances by any law of the christian church they did not pretend to be so bound nevertheless they imagined that there was an efficacy in these observances a merit a recommendation to favor and a ground of acceptance with god for those who complied with them this was a situation of thought to which the tenor of the decree did not apply accordingly st pauls address to the galatians which is throughout adapted to this situation runs in a strain widely different from the language of the decree christ is become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the law chap v ver   i e whosoever places his dependence upon any merit he may apprehend there to be in legal observances the decree had said nothing like this therefore it would have been useless to have produced the decree in an argument of which this was the burden in like manner as in contending with an anchorite who should insist upon the superior holiness of a recluse ascetic life and the value of such mortifications in the sight of god it would be to no purpose to prove that the laws of the church did not require these vows or even to prove that the laws of the church expressly left every christian to his liberty this would avail little toward abating his estimation of their merit or toward settling the point in controversy mr lockes solution of this difficulty is by no means satisfactory st paul he says did not remind the galatians of the apostolic decree because they already had it in the first place it does not appear with certainty that they had it in the second place if they had it this was rather a reason than otherwise for referring them to it the passage in the acts from which mr lock concludes that the galatic churches were in possession of the decree is the fourth verse of the sixteenth chapter and as they paul and timothy went through the cities they delivered them the decrees for to keep that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at jerusalem in my opinion this delivery of the decree was confined to the churches to which st paul came in pursuance of the plan upon which he set out of visiting the brethren in every city where he had preached the word of the lord the history of which progress and of all that pertained to it is closed in the fifth verse when the history informs us that so were the churches established in the faith and increased in number daily then the history proceeds upon a new section of the narrative by telling us that when they had gone throughout phrygia and the region of galatia they assayed to go into bithynia the decree itself is directed to the brethren which are of the gentiles in antioch syria and cilicia that is to churches already founded and in which this question had been stirred and i think the observation of the noble author of the miscellanea sacra is not only ingenious but highly probable viz that there is in this place a dislocation of the text and that the fourth and fifth verses of the sixteenth chapter ought to follow the last verse of the fifteenth so as to make the entire passage run thus and they went through syria and cilicia to the christians of which countries the decree was addressed confirming the churches and as they went through the cities they delivered them the decrees for to keep that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at jerusalem and so were the churches established in the faith and increased in number daily and then the sixteenth chapter takes up a new and unbroken paragraph then came he to derbe and lystra etc when st paul came as he did into galatia to preach the gospel for the first time in a new place it is not probable that he would make mention of the decree or rather letter of the church of jerusalem which presupposed christianity to be known and which related to certain doubts that had arisen in some established christian communities  the second reason which mr lock assigns for the omission of the decree viz that st pauls sole object in the epistle was to acquit himself of the imputation that had been charged upon him of actually preaching circumcision does not appear to me to be strictly true it was not the sole object the epistle is written in general opposition to the judaizing inclinations which he found to prevail amongst his converts the avowal of his own doctrine and of his steadfast adherence to that doctrine formed a necessary part of the design of his letter but was not the whole of it     another difficulty arises from the account of peters conduct toward the gentile converts at antioch as given in the epistle in the latter part of the second chapter which conduct it is said is consistent neither with the revelation communicated to him upon the conversion of cornelius nor with the part he took in the debate at jerusalem but in order to understand either the difficulty or the solution it will be necessary to state and explain the passage itself when peter was come to antioch i withstood him to the face because he was to be blamed for before that certain came from james he did eat with the gentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision and the other jews dissembled likewise with him insomuch that barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation but when i saw they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel i said unto peter before them all if thou being a jew live after the manner of gentiles and not as do the jews why compellest thou the gentiles to live as do the jews now the question that produced the dispute to which these words relate was not whether the gentiles were capable of being admitted into the christian covenant that had been fully settled nor was it whether it should be accounted essential to the profession of christianity that they should conform themselves to the law of moses that was the question at jerusalem but it was whether upon the gentiles becoming christians the jews might thenceforth eat and drink with them as with their own brethren upon this point st peter betrayed some inconstancy and so he might agreeably enough to his history he might consider the vision at joppa as a direction for the occasion rather than as universally abolishing the distinction between jew and gentile i do not mean with respect to final acceptance with god but as to the manner of their living together in society at least he might not have comprehended this point with such clearness and certainty as to stand out upon it against the fear of bringing upon himself the censure and complaint of his brethren in the church of jerusalem who still adhered to their ancient prejudices but peter it is said compelled the gentiles   why compellest thou the gentiles to live as do the jews how did he do that the only way in which peter appears to have compelled the gentiles to comply with the jewish institution was by withdrawing himself from their society by which he may be understood to have made this declaration we do not deny your right to be considered as christians we do not deny your title in the promises of the gospel even without compliance with our law but if you would have us jews live with you as we do with one another that is if you would in all respects be treated by us as jews you must live as such yourselves this i think was the compulsion which st peters conduct imposed upon the gentiles and for which st paul reproved him  as to the part which the historian ascribes to st peter in the debate at jerusalem beside that it was a different question which was there agitated from that which produced the dispute at antioch there is nothing to hinder us from supposing that the dispute at antioch was prior to the consultation at jerusalem or that peter in consequence of this rebuke might have afterward maintained firmer sentiments  chap vi the epistle to the ephesians no i this epistle and the epistle to the colossians appear to have been transmitted to their respective churches by the same messenger but that ye also may know my affairs and how i do tychicus a beloved brother and faithful minister in the lord shall make known to you all things whom i have sent unto you for the same purpose that ye might know our affairs and that he might comfort your hearts ephesians chap vi ver       this text if it do not expressly declare clearly i think intimates that the letter was sent by tychicus the words made use of in the epistle to the colossians are very similar to these and afford the same implication that tychicus in conjunction with onesimus was the bearer of the letter to that church all my state shall tychicus declare unto you who is a beloved brother and a faithful minister and fellow servant in the lord whom i have sent unto you for the same purpose that he might know your estate and comfort your hearts with onesimus a faithful and beloved brother who is one of you they shall make known unto you all things which are done here colos chap iv ver    both epistles represent the writer as under imprisonment for the gospel and both treat of the same general subject the epistle therefore to the ephesians and the epistle to the colossians import to be two letters written by the same person at or nearly at the same time and upon the same subject and to have been sent by the same messenger now every thing in the sentiments order and diction of the two writings corresponds with what might be expected from this circumstance of identity or cognation in their original the leading doctrine of both epistles is the union of jews and gentiles under the christian dispensation and that doctrine in both is established by the same arguments or more properly speaking illustrated by the same similitudes st paul i am apt to believe has been sometimes accused of inconclusive reasoning by our mistaking that for reasoning which was only intended for illustration he is not to be read as a man whose own persuasion of the truth of what he taught always or solely depended upon the views under which he represents it in his writings taking for granted the certainty of his doctrine as resting upon the revelation that had been imparted to him he exhibits it frequently to the conception of his readers under images and allegories in which if an analogy may be perceived or even sometimes a poetic resemblance be found it is all perhaps that is required  one head one body one new man one temple are in both epistles the figures under which the society of believers in christ and their common relation to him as such is represented compare ephesians i    with colos i    iv    ii    ii    iii  0    also ephesians ii       with colos     ii    i      ii  0 ii      the ancient and as had been thought the indelible distinction between jew and gentile in both epistles is declared to be now abolished by his cross beside this consent in the general tenor of the two epistles and in the run also and warmth of thought with which they are composed we may naturally expect in letters produced under the circumstances in which these appear to have been written a closer resemblance of style and diction than between other letters of the same person but of distant dates or between letters adapted to different occasions in particular we may look for many of the same expressions and sometimes for whole sentences being alike since such expressions and sentences would be repeated in the second letter whichever that was as yet fresh in the authors mind from the writing of the first this repetition occurs in the following examples when verbal comparisons are relied upon it becomes necessary to state the original but that the english reader may be interrupted as little as may be i shall in general do this in the note   ephesians chapter i ver   in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins ephesians chapter i ver      colos chapter i ver    in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins col chapter i ver      however it must be observed that in this latter text many copies have not    beside the sameness of the words it is farther remarkable that the sentence is in both places preceded by the same introductory idea in the epistle to the ephesians it is the  beloved  in that to the colossians it is  his dear son  in whom we have redemption the sentence appears to have been suggested to the mind of the writer by the idea which had accompanied it before  ephesians chapter i ver  0 all things both which are in heaven and which are in earth even in him ephesians chapter i ver  0    colos chapter i ver  0 all things by him whether they be things in earth or things in heaven colos chapter i ver  0    this quotation is the more observable because the connecting of things in earth with things in heaven is a very singular sentiment and found no where else but in these two epistles the words also are introduced and followed by a train of thought nearly alike they are introduced by describing the union which christ had effected and they are followed by telling the gentile churches that they were incorporated into it  ephesians chapter iii ver   the dispensation of the grace of god which is given me to you ward ephesians chapter iii ver      colos chapter i ver    the dispensation of god which is given to me for you colos chapter i ver       of these sentences it may likewise be observed that the accompanying ideas are similar in both places they are immediately preceded by the mention of his present sufferings in both places they are immediately followed by the mention of the mystery which was the great subject of his preaching  ephesians chapter v ver    in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the lord ephesians chapter v ver       colos chapter iii ver    in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the lord colos chapter iii ver       ephesians chapter vi ver    whom i have sent unto you for the same purpose that ye might know our affairs and that he might comfort your hearts ephesians chapter vi ver       colos chapter iv ver   whom i have sent unto you for the same purpose that he might know your estate and comfort your hearts colos chapter iv ver      in these examples we do not perceive a cento of phrases gathered from one composition and strung together in the other but the occasional occurrence of the same expression to a mind a second time revolving the same ideas    whoever writes two letters or two discourses nearly upon the same subject and at no great distance of time but without any express recollection of what he had written before will find himself repeating some sentences in the very order of the words in which he had already used them but he will more frequently find himself employing some principal terms with the order inadvertently changed or with the order disturbed by the intermixture of other words and phrases expressive of ideas rising up at the time or in many instances repeating not single words nor yet whole sentences but parts and fragments of sentences of all these varieties the examination of our two epistles will furnish plain examples and i should rely upon this class of instances more than upon the last because although an impostor might transcribe into a forgery entire sentences and phrases yet the dislocation of words the partial recollection of phrases and sentences the intermixture of new terms and new ideas with terms and ideas before used which will appear in the examples that follow and which are the natural properties of writings produced under the circumstances in which these epistles are represented to have been composed would not i think have occurred to the invention of a forger nor if they had occurred would they have been so easily executed this studied variation was a resinement in forgery which i believe did not exist or if we can suppose it to have been practiced in the instances adduced below why it may be asked was not the same art exercised upon those which we have collected in the preceding class  ephesians chapter i ver    chapter ii ver   toward us who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but in that which is to come and has put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church which is his body the fullness of all things that fills all in all and you has he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience among whom also we had all our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath even as others but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins has quickened us together with christ ephesians chapter i ver     0 ii        colos chapter ii ver       through the faith of the operation of god who has raised him from the dead and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of the flesh has he quickened together with him colos chapter ii          out of the long quotation from the ephesians take away the parentheses and you have left a sentence almost in terms the same as the short quotation from the colossians the resemblance is more visible in the original than in our translation for what is rendered in one place the working and in another the operation is the same greek term  in one place it is  in the other  here therefore we have the same sentiment and nearly in the same words but in the ephesians twice broken or interrupted by incidental thoughts which st paul as his manner was enlarges upon by the way vide lock in loc  and then returns to the thread of his discourse it is interrupted the first time by a view which breaks in upon his mind of the exaltation of christ and the second time by a description of heathen depravity i have only to remark that griesbach in his very accurate edition gives the parentheses very nearly in the same manner in which they are here placed and that without any respect to the comparison which we are proposing  ephesians chapter iv ver    with all lowliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace there is one body and one spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling ephesians chapter iv ver       colos chapter iii ver      put on therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness longsuffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against any even as christ forgave you so also do ye and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness and let the peace of god rule in your hearts to the which also ye are called in one body colos chapter iii ver         in these two quotations the words  occur in exactly the same order  is also found in both but in a different connection  answers to  to  yet is this similitude found in the midst of sentences otherwise very different  ephesians chapter iv ver    from whom the whole body sitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part makes increase of the body ephesians chapter iv ver       col chapter ii ver    from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered and knit together increases with the increase of god colos chapter ii ver       in these quotations are read  in both places  answering to  to  to  and yet the sentences are considerably diversified in other parts  ephesians chapter iv ver    and be kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for christs sake has forgiven you ephesians chapter iv ver       colos chapter iii ver    forbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against any even as christ forgave you so also do ye colos chapter iii ver       here we have forgiving one another even as god for christs sake  has forgiven you in the first quotation substantially repeated in the second but in the second the sentence is broken by the interposition of a new clause if any man have a quarrel against any and the latter part is a little varied instead of god in christ it is christ has forgiven ye  ephesians chapter iv ver      that ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that ye put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness ephesians chapter iv ver         colos chapter iii ver    0 seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him colos chapter iii ver    0    in these quotations putting off the old man and putting on the new appears in both the idea is further explained by calling it a renewal in the one renewed in the spirit of your mind in the other renewed in knowledge in both the new man is said to be formed according to the same model in the one he is after god created in righteousness and true holiness in the other he is renewed after the image of him that created him in a word it is the same person writing upon a kindred subject with the terms and ideas which he had before employed still floating in his memory in these comparisons we often perceive the reason why the writer though expressing the same idea uses a different term namely because the term before used is employed in the sentence under a different form thus in the quotations under our eye the new man is  in the ephesians and  in the colossians but then it is because  is used in the next word    ephesians chapter v ver     because of these things comes the wrath of god upon the children of disobedience be not yet therefore partakers with them for ye were sometimes darkness but now are ye light in the lord walk therefore as children of light ephesians chapter v ver       colos chapter iii ver     for which things sake the wrath of god comes on the children of disobedience in the which ye also walked sometime when ye lived in them but now you also put off all these colos chapter iii ver       these verses assord a specimen of that partial resemblance which is only to be met with when no imitation is designed when no studied recollection is employed but when the mind exercised upon the same subject is left to the spontaneous return of such terms and phrases as having been used before may happen to present themselves again the sentiment of both passages is throughout alike half of that sentiment the denunciation of gods wrath is expressed in identical words the other half viz the admonition to quit their former conversation in words entirely different  ephesians chapter v ver       see then that ye walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise redeeming the time ephesians chapter v ver          golos chapter iv ver   walk in wisdom toward them that are without redeeming the time colos chapter iv ver      this is another example of that mixture which we remarked of sameness and variety in the language of one writer redeeming the time  is a literal repetition walk not as fools but as wise  answers exactly in sense and nearly in terms to walk in wisdom   is a very different phrase but is intended to convey precisely the same idea as   is not well rendered circumspectly it means what in modern speech we should call correctly and when we advise a person to behave correctly our advice is always given with a reference to the opinion of others  walk correctly redeeming the time i e suiting yourselves to the difficulty and ticklishness of the times in which we live because the days are evil  ephesians chapter vi ver     0 and praying for me that utterance may be given unto me that i may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel for which i am an ambassador in bonds that therein i may speak boldly as i ought to speak ephesians chapter vi ver     0    colos chapter iv ver     withal praying also for us that god would open unto us a door of utterance to speak the mystery of christ for which i am also in bonds that i may make it manifest as i ought to speak colos chapter iv ver        in these quotations the phrase as i ought to speak  the words utterance  mystery  open  and  are the same to make known the mystery of the gospel  answers to make it manifest  for which i am an ambassador in bonds  to for which i am also in bonds   ephesians chapter v ver     wives submit yourselves to your own husbands as unto the lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loves his wife loves himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourishes and cherishes it even as the lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and be joined unto his wife and they two shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband children obey your parents in the lord for this is right honor thy father and thy mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee and that thou may live long on the earth and ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord servants be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart as unto christ not with eye service as men pleasers but as the servants of christ doing the will of god from the heart with good will doing service as to the lord and not to men knowing that whatsoever good thing any man does the same shall he receive of the lord whether he be bond or free and ye masters do the same things unto them forbearing threatening knowing that your master also is in heaven neither is there respect of persons with him ephesians chapter v ver       colos chapter iii ver     ephesians  colos  ephesians  colos  ephesians  colos   lectio non spernenda griesbach  ephesians  colos   colos chapter iii ver    wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as it is fit in the lord husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them children obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing unto the lord fathers provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged servants obey in all things your masters according to the flesh not with eye service as men pleasers but in singleness of heart fearing god and whatever ye do do it heartily as to the lord and not unto men knowing that of the lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance for ye serve the lord christ but he that does wrong shall receive for the wrong which he has done and there is no respect of persons masters give unto your servants that which is just and equal knowing that ye also have a master in heaven  the passages marked by italics in the quotation from the ephesians bear a strict resemblance not only in signification but in terms to the quotation from the colossians both the words and the order of the words are in many clauses a duplicate of one another in the epistle to the colossians these passages are laid together in that to the ephesians they are divided by intermediate matter especially by a long digressive allusion to the mysterious union between christ and his church which possessing as mr lock has well observed the mind of the apostle from being an incidental thought grows up into the principal subject the affinity between these two passages in signification in terms and in the order of the words is closer than can be pointed out between any parts of any two epistles in the volume  if the reader would see how the same subject is treated by a different hand and how distinguishable it is from the production of the same pen let him turn to the second and third chapters of the first epistle of st peter the duties of servants of wives and of husbands are enlarged upon in that epistle as they are in the epistle to the ephesians but the subjects both occur in a different order and the train of sentiment subjoined to each is totally unlike    in two letters issuing from the same person nearly at the same time and upon the same general occasion we may expect to trace the influence of association in the order in which the topics follow one another certain ideas universally or usually suggest others here the order is what we call natural and from such an order nothing can be concluded but when the order is arbitrary yet alike the concurrence indicates the effect of that principle by which ideas which have been once joined commonly revisit the thoughts together the epistles under consideration furnish the two following remarkable instances of this species of agreement  ephesians chapter iv ver    and that ye put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness wherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one of another ephesians chapter iv ver          colos chapter iii ver   lie not one to another seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge colos chapter iii ver      the vice of lying or a correction of that vice does not seem to bear any nearer relation to the putting on the new man than a reformation in any other article of morals yet these two ideas we see stand in both epistles in immediate connection  ephesians chapter v ver  0    giving thanks always for all things unto god and the father in the name of our lord jesus christ submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord ephesians chapter v ver  0      colos chapter iii ver    whatsoever ye do in word or deed do all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god and the father by him wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as it is sit in the lord colos chapter iii ver       in both these passages submission follows giving of thanks without any similitude in the ideas which should account for the transition  it is not necessary to pursue the comparison between the two epistles farther the argument which results from it stands thus now two other epistles contain a circumstance which indicates that they were written at the same or nearly at the same time no two other epistles exhibit so many marks of correspondency and resemblance if the original which we ascribe to these two epistles be the true one that is if they were both really written by st paul and both sent to their respective destination by the same messenger the similitude is in all points what should be expected to take place if they were forgeries then the mention of tychicus in both epistles and in a manner which shows that he either carried or accompanied both epistles was inserted for the purpose of accounting for their similitude or else the structure of the epistles was designedly adapted to that circumstance or lastly the conformity between the contents of the forgeries and what is thus indirectly intimated concerning their date was only a happy accident not one of these three suppositions will gain credit with a reader who peruses the epistles with attention and who reviews the several examples we have pointed out and the observations with which they were accompanied  no ii there is such a thing as a peculiar word or phrase cleaving as it were to the memory of a writer or speaker and presenting itself to his utterance at every turn when we observe this we call it a cant word or a cant phrase it is a natural effect of habit and would appear more frequently than it does had not the rules of good writing taught the ear to be offended with the iteration of the same sound and oftentimes caused us to reject on that account the word which offered itself first to our recollection with a writer who like st paul either knew not these rules or disregarded them such words will not be avoided the truth is an example of this kind runs through several of his epistles and in the epistle before us abounds and that is in the word riches  used metaphorically as an augmentative of the idea to which it happens to be subjoined thus the riches of his glory his riches in glory  riches of the glory of his inheritance  riches of the glory of this mystery romans chapter ix ver    ephesians chapter iii ver    ephesians chapter i ver    colos chapter i ver     riches of his grace twice in the ephesians chapter i ver   and chapter ii ver    riches of the full assurance of understanding colos chapter ii ver    riches of his goodness romans chapter ii ver    riches of the wisdom of god romans chapter xi ver     riches of christ ephesians chapter iii ver   in a like sense the adjective romans chapter x ver     rich unto all that call upon him ephesians chapter ii ver    rich in mercy   timothy chapter vi ver     rich in good works also the adverb colos chapter iii ver    let the word of christ dwell in you richly this figurative use of the word though so familiar to st paul does not occur in any part of the new testament except once in the epistle of st james chapter ii ver   has not god chosen the poor of this world rich in faith where it is manifestly suggested by the antithesis i propose the frequent yet seemingly unaffected use of this phrase in the epistle before us as one internal mark of its genuineness  no iii there is another singularity in st pauls style which wherever it is found may be deemed a badge of authenticity because if it were noticed it would not i think be imitated inasmuch as it almost always produces embarrassment and interruption in the reasoning this singularity is a species of digression which may properly i think be denominated going off at a word it is turning aside from the subject upon the occurrence of some particular word forsaking the train of thought then in hand and entering upon a parenthetic sentence in which that word is the prevailing term i shall lay before the reader some examples of this collected from the other epistles and then propose two examples of it which are found in the epistle to the ephesians   cor chapter ii ver    at the word savor now thanks be unto god which always causes us to triumph in christ and makes manifest the savor of his knowledge by us in every place for we are unto god a sweet savor of christ in them that are saved and in them that perish to the one we are the savor of death unto death and to the other the savor of life unto life and who is sufficient for these things for we are not as many which corrupt the word of god but as of sincerity but as of god in the sight of god speak we in christ again   cor chapter iii ver   at the word epistle need we as some others epistles of commendation to you or of commendation from you ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the heart the position of the words in the original shows more strongly than in the translation that it was the occurrence of the word  which gave birth to the sentence that follows   cor chap iii ver     again   cor chapter iii ver    etc at the word vail seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech and not as moses which put a vail over his face that the children of israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded for until this day remains the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament which vail is done away in christ but even unto this day when moses is read the vail is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the vail shall be taken away now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint not  who sees not that this whole allegory of the vail arises entirely out of the occurrence of the word in telling us that moses put a vail over his face and that it drew the apostle away from the proper subject of his discourse the dignity of the office in which he was engaged which subject he fetches up again almost in the words with which he had left it therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint not the sentence which he had before been going on with and in which he had been interrupted by the vail was seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech  in the epistle to the ephesians the reader will remark two instances in which the same habit of composition obtains he will recognize the same pen one he will find chap iv ver     at the word ascended wherefore he says when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first unto the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things and he gave some apostles etc  the other appears chap v ver      at the word light for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever does make manifest is light wherefore he says awake thou that sleep and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee light see then that ye walk circumspectly  no iv although it does not appear to have ever been disputed that the epistle before us was written by st paul yet it is well known that a doubt has long been entertained concerning the persons to whom it was addressed the question is founded partly in some ambiguity in the external evidence marcion a heretic of the second century as quoted by tertullian a father in the beginning of the third calls it the epistle to the laodiceans from what we know of marcion his judgment is little to be relied upon nor is it perfectly clear that marcion was rightly understood by tertullian if however marcion be brought to prove that some copies in his time gave  in the superscription his testimony if it be truly interpreted is not diminished by his heresy for as grotius observes  cur in ea re mentiretur nihil erat causae the name  in the first verse upon which word singly depends the proof that the epistle was written to the ephesians is not read in all the manuscripts now extant i admit however that the external evidence preponderates with a manifest excess on the side of the received reading the objection therefore principally arises from the contents of the epistle itself which in many respects militate with the supposition that it was written to the church of ephesus according to the history st paul had passed two whole years at ephesus acts chap xix ver  0 and in this point viz of st paul having preached for a considerable length of time at ephesus the history is confirmed by the two epistles to the corinthians and by the two epistles to timothy i will tarry at ephesus until pentecost   cor chap xvi ver   we would not have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in asia   cor chap i ver   as i besought thee to abide still at ephesus when i went into macedonia   timothy chap i ver   and in how many things he ministered to me at ephesus thou know well   timothy chap i ver    i adduce these testimonies because had it been a competition of credit between the history and the epistle i should have thought myself bound to have preferred the epistle now every epistle which st paul wrote to churches which he himself had founded or which he had visited abounds with references and appeals to what had passed during the time that he was present amongst them whereas there is not a text in the epistle to the ephesians from which we can collect that he had ever been at ephesus at all the two epistles to the corinthians the epistle to the galatians the epistle to the philippians and the two epistles to the thessalonians are of this class and they are full of allusions to the apostles history his reception and his conduct whilst amongst them the total want of which in the epistle before us is very difficult to account for if it was in truth written to the church of ephesus in which city he had resided for so long a time this is the first and strongest objection but farther the epistle to the colossians was addressed to a church in which st paul had never been this we infer from the first verse of the second chapter for i would that ye knew what great conflict i have for you and for them at laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh there could be no propriety in thus joining the colossians and laodiceans with those who had not seen his face in the flesh if they did not also belong to the same description dr lardner contends against the validity of this conclusion but i think without success lardner vol xiv p     edit       now his address to the colossians whom he had notvisited is precisely the same as his address to the christians to whom he wrote in the epistle which we are now considering we give thanks to god and the father of our lord jesus christ praying always for you since we heard of your faith in christ jesus and of the love which ye have to all the saints col chap i ver   thus he speaks to the colossians in the epistle before us as follows wherefore i also after i heard of your faith in the lord jesus and love unto all the saints cease not to give thanks for you in my prayers chap i ver    the terms of this address are observable the words having heard of your faith and love are the very words we see which he uses toward strangers and it is not probable that he should employ the same in accosting a church in which he had long exercised his ministry and whose faith and love he must have personally known mr lock endeavors to avoid this difficulty by explaining  their faith of which st paul had heard to mean the steadfastness of their persuasion that they were called into the kingdom of god without subjection to the mosaic institution but this interpretation seems to me extremely hard for in the manner in which faith is here joined with love in the expression your faith and love it could not be meant to denote any particular tenet which distinguished one set of christians from others forasmuch as the expression describes the general virtues of the christian profession vide lock in loc  the epistle to the romans was written before st paul had been at rome and his address to them runs in the same strain with that just now quoted i thank my god through jesus christ for you all that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world romans chap i ver   let us now see what was the form in which our apostle was accustomed to introduce his epistles when he wrote to those with whom he was already acquainted to the corinthians it was this i thank my god always on your behalf for the grace of god which is given you by christ jesus   cor chap i ver   to the philippians i thank my god upon every remembrance of you phil chap i ver   to the thessalonians we give thanks to god always for you all making mention of you in our prayers remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love   thessalonians chap i ver   to timothy i thank god whom i serve from my forefathers with pure conscience that without ceasing i have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day   timothy chap i ver   in these quotations it is usually his remembrance and never his hearing of them which he makes the subject of his thankfulness to god  as great difficulties stand in the way of supposing the epistle before us to have been written to the church of ephesus so i think it probable that it is actually the epistle to the laodiceans referred to in the fourth chapter of the epistle to the colossians the text which contains that reference is this when this epistle is read among you cause that it be read also in the church of the laodiceans and that ye likewise read the epistle from laodicea chap iv ver    the epistle from laodicea was an epistle sent by st paul to that church and by them transmitted to colosse the two churches were mutually to communicate the epistles they had received this is the way in which the direction is explained by the greater part of commentators and is the most probable sense that can be given to it it is also probable that the epistle alluded to was an epistle which had been received by the church of laodicea lately it appears then with a considerable degree of evidence that there existed an epistle of st pauls nearly of the same date with the epistle to the colossians and an epistle directed to a church for such the church of laodicea was in which st paul had never been what has been observed concerning the epistle before us shows that it answers perfectly to that character  nor does the mistake seem very difficult to account for whoever inspects the map of asia minor will see that a person proceeding from rome to laodicea would probably land at ephesus as the nearest frequented seaport in that direction might not tychicus then in passing through ephesus communicate to the christians of that place the letter with which he was charged and might not copies of that letter be multiplied and preserved at ephesus might not some of the copies drop the words of designation  and it is remarkable that there seem to have been some ancient copies without the words of designation either the words in ephesus or the words in laodicea st basil a writer of the fourth century speaking of the present epistle has this very singular passage and writing to the ephesians as truly united to him who is through knowledge he paul calls them in a peculiar sense such who are saying to the saints who are and or even the faithful in christ jesus for so those before us have transmitted it and we have found it in ancient copies dr mill interprets and notwithstanding some objections that have been made to him in my opinion rightly interprets these words of basil as declaring that this father had seen certain copies of the epistle in which the words in ephesus were wanting and the passage i think must be considered as basils fanciful way of explaining what was really a corrupt and defective reading for i do not believe it possible that the author of the epistle could have originally written  without any name of place to follow it  which it was of no consequence to an ephesian to retain might not copies of the letter come out into the christian church at large from ephesus and might not this give occasion to a belief that the letter was written to that church and lastly might not this belief produce the error which we suppose to have crept into the inscription  no v as our epistle purports to have been written during st pauls imprisonment at rome which lies beyond the period to which the acts of the apostles brings up his history and as we have seen and acknowledged that the epistle contains no reference to any transaction at ephesus during the apostles residence in that city we cannot expect that it should supply many marks of agreement with the narrative one coincidence however occurs and a coincidence of that minute and less obvious kind which as has been repeetedly observed is of all others the most to be relied upon  chap vi ver     0 we read praying for me that i may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel for which i am an ambassador in bonds  in bonds  in a chain in the twentyeighth chapter of the acts we are informed that paul after his arrival at rome was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him dr lardner has shown that this mode of custody was in use amongst the romans and that whenever it was adopted the prisoner was bound to the soldier by a single chain in reference to which st paul in the twentieth verse of this chapter tells the jews whom he had assembled for this cause therefore have i called for you to see you and to speak with you because that for the hope of israel i am bound with this chain  it is in exact conformity therefore with the truth of st pauls situation at the time that he declares of himself in the epistle  and the exactness is the more remarkable as  a chain is no where used in the singular number to express any other kind of custody when the prisoners hands or feet were bound together the word was  bonds as in the twentysixth chapter of the acts where paul replies to agrippa i would to god that not only thou but also all that hear me this day were both almost and altogether such as i am except these bonds  when the prisoner was confined between two soldiers as in the case of peter acts chap xii ver   two chains were employed and it is said upon his miraculous deliverance that the chains  in the plural fell from his hands  the noun and  the verb being general terms were applicable to this in common with any other species of personal coercion but  in the singular number to none but this  if it can be suspected that the writer of the present epistle who in no other particular appears to have availed himself of the information concerning st paul delivered in the acts had in this verse borrowed the word which he read in that book and had adapted his expression to what he found there recorded of st pauls treatment at rome in short that the coincidence here noted was effected by craft and design i think it a strong reply to remark that in the parallel passage of the epistle to the colossians the same allusion is not preserved the words there are praying also for us that god would open unto us a door of utterance to speak the mystery of christ for which i am also in bonds  after what has been shown in a preceding number there can be little doubt but that these two epistles were written by the same person if the writer therefore sought for and fraudulently inserted the correspondency into one epistle why did he not do it in the other a real prisoner might use either general words which comprehended this amongst many other modes of custody or might use appropriate words which specified this and distinguished it from any other mode it would be accidental which form of expression he fell upon but an impostor who had the art in one place to employ the appropriate term for the purpose of fraud would have used it in both places  chap vii the epistle to the philippians no i when a transaction is referred to in such a manner as that the reference is easily and immediately understood by those who are beforehand or from other quarters acquainted with the fact but is obscure or imperfect or requires investigation or a comparison of different parts in order to be made clear to other readers the transaction so referred to is probably real because had it been fictitious the writer would have set forth his story more fully and plainly not merely as conscious of the fiction but as conscious that his readers could have no other knowledge of the subject of his allusion than from the information of which he put them in possession  the account of epaphroditus in the epistle to the philippians of his journey to rome and of the business which brought him thither is the article to which i mean to apply this observation there are three passages in the epistle which relate to this subject the first chap i ver   even as it is meet for me to think this of you all because i have you in my heart inasmuch as both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel ye all are  joint contributors to the gift which i have received pearce i believe was the first commentator who gave this sense to the expression and i believe also that his exposition is now generally assented to he interprets in the same sense the phrase in the fifth verse which our translation renders your fellowship in the gospel but which in the original is not  or  but   nothing more is said in this place in the latter part of the second chapter and at the distance of half the epistle from the last quotation the subject appears again yet i supposed it necessary to send to you epaphroditus my brother and companion in labor and fellow soldier but your messenger and he that ministered to my wants for he longed after you all and was full of heaviness because that ye had heard that he had been sick for indeed he was sick nigh unto death but god had mercy on him and not on him only but on me also lest i should have sorrow upon sorrow i sent him therefore the more carefully that when ye see him again ye may rejoice and that i may be the less sorrowful receive him therefore in the lord with all gladness and hold such in reputation because for the work of christ he was nigh unto death not regarding his life to supply your lack of service toward me chap ii ver    0 the matter is here dropped and no farther mention made of it till it is taken up near the conclusion of the epistle as follows but i rejoiced in the lord greatly that now at the last your care of me has flourished again wherein ye were also careful but ye lacked opportunity not that i speak in respect of want for i have learned in whatsoever state i am therewith to be content i know both how to be abased and i know how to abound every where and in all things i am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need i can do all things through christ which strengthens me notwithstanding ye have well done that ye did communicate with my affliction now ye philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel when i departed from macedonia no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving but ye only for even in thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity not because i desire a gift but i desire fruit that may abound to your account but i have all and abound i am full having received of epaphroditus the things which were sent from you chap iv ver  0   to the philippian reader who knew that contributions were wont to be made in that church for the apostles subsistence and relief that the supply which they were accustomed to send to him had been delayed by the want of opportunity that epaphroditus had undertaken the charge of conveying their liberality to the hands of the apostle that he had acquitted himself of this commission at the peril of his life by hastening to rome under the oppression of a grievous sickness to a reader who knew all this beforehand every line in the above quotations would be plain and clear but how is it with a stranger the knowledge of these several particulars is necessary to the perception and explanation of the references yet that knowledge must be gathered from a comparison of passages lying at a great distance from one another texts must be interpreted by texts long subsequent to them which necessarily produces embarrassment and suspense the passage quoted from the beginning of the epistle contains an acknowledgment on the part of the apostle of the liberality which the philippians had exercised toward him but the allusion is so general and indeterminate that had nothing more been said in the sequel of the epistle it would hardly have been applied to this occasion at all in the second quotation epaphroditus is declared to have ministered to the apostles wants and to have supplied their lack of service toward him but how that is at whose expense or from what fund he ministered or what was the lack of service which he supplied are left very much unexplained till we arrive at the third quotation where we find that epaphroditus ministered to st pauls wants only by conveying to his hands the contributions of the philippians i am full having received of epaphroditus the things which were sent from you and that the lack of service which he supplied was a delay or interruption of their accustomed bounty occasioned by the want of opportunity i rejoiced in the lord greatly that now at the last your care of me has flourished again wherein ye were also careful but ye lacked opportunity the affair at length comes out clear but it comes out by piecemeal the clearness is the result of the reciprocal illustration of divided texts should any one choose therefore to insinuate that this whole story of epaphroditus of his journey his errand his sickness or even his existence might for what we know have no other foundation than in the invention of the forger of the epistle i answer that a forger would have set forth his story connectedly and also more fully and more perspicuously if the epistle be authentic and the transaction real then every thing which is said concerning epaphroditus and his commission would be clear to those into whose hands the epistle was expected to come considering the philippians as his readers a person might naturally write upon the subject as the author of the epistle has written but there is no supposition of forgery with which it will suit  no ii the history of epaphroditus supplies another observation indeed he was sick nigh unto death but god had mercy on him and not on him only but on me also lest i should have sorrow upon sorrow in this passage no intimation is given that epaphrodituss recovery was miraculous it is plainly i think spoken of as a natural event this instance together with one in the second epistle to timothy trophimus have i left at miletum sick affords a proof that the power of performing cures and by parity of reason of working other miracles was a power which only visited the apostles occasionally and did not at all depend upon their own will paul undoubtedly would have healed epaphroditus if he could nor if the power of working cures had awaited his disposal would he have left his fellow traveller at miletum sick this i think is a fair observation upon the instances adduced but it is not the observation i am concerned to make it is more for the purpose of my argument to remark that forgery upon such an occasion would not have spared a miracle much less would it have introduced st paul professing the utmost anxiety for the safety of his friend yet acknowledging himself unable to help him which he does almost expressly in the case of trophimus for he left him sick and virtually in the passage before us in which he felicitates himself upon the recovery of epaphroditus in terms which almost exclude the supposition of any supernatural means being employed to effect it this is a reserve which nothing but truth would have imposed  no iii chap iv ver       now ye philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel when i departed from macedonia no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving but ye only for even in thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity  it will be necessary to state the greek of this passage because our translation does not i think give the sense of it accurately    the reader will please to direct his attention to the corresponding particles  and  which connect the words  with the words  and denote as i interpret the passage two distinct donations or rather donations at two distinct periods one at thessalonica  the other after his departure from macedonia  luke chapter ii ver     as the angels were gone away i e after their departure  matt chapter xii ver     when the unclean spirit is gone i e after his departure  john chapter xiii ver  0   when he was gone i e after his departure  acts chapter x ver    and when the angel which spoke unto him was departed i e after his departure  etc  i would render the passage so as to mark these different periods thus now ye philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel when i was departed from macedonia no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving but ye only and that also in thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity now with this exposition of the passage compare   cor chap xi ver     i robbed other churches taking wages of them to do you service and when i was present with you and wanted i was chargeable to no man for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from macedonia supplied  it appears from st pauls history as related in the acts of the apostles that upon leaving macedonia he passed after a very short stay at athens into achaia it appears secondly from the quotation out of the epistle to the corinthians that in achaia he accepted no pecuniary assistance from the converts of that country but that he drew a supply for his wants from the macedonian christians agreeably whereunto it appears in the third place from the text which is the subject of the present number that the brethren in philippi a city of macedonia had followed him with their munificence  when he was departed from macedonia that is when he was come into achaia  the passage under consideration affords another circumstance of agreement deserving of our notice the gift alluded to in the epistle to the philippians is stated to have been made in the beginning of the gospel this phrase is most naturally explained to signify the first preaching of the gospel in these parts viz on that side of the aegean sea the succors referred to in the epistle to the corinthians as received from macedonia are stated to have been received by him upon his first visit to the peninsula of greece the dates therefore assigned to the donation in the two epistles agree yet is the date in one ascertained very incidentally namely by the considerations which fix the date of the epistle itself and in the other by an expression the beginning of the gospel much too general to have been used if the text had been penned with any view to the correspondency we are remarking  farther the phrase in the beginning of the gospel raises an idea in the readers mind that the gospel had been preached there more than once the writer would hardly have called the visit to which he refers the beginning of the gospel if he had not also visited them in some other stage of it the fact corresponds with this idea if we consult the sixteenth and twentieth chapters of the acts we shall find that st paul before his imprisonment at rome during which this epistle purports to have been written had been twice in macedonia and each time at philippi  no iv that timothy had been alongwith st paul at philippi is a fact which seems to be implied in this epistle twice first he joins in the salutation with which the epistle opens paul and timotheus the servants of jesus christ to all the saints in christ jesus which are at philippi secondly and more directly the point is inferred from what is said concerning him chap ii ver    but i trust in the lord jesus to send timotheus shortly unto you that i also may be of good comfort when i know your state for i have no man like minded who will naturally care for your state for all seek their own not the things which are jesus christs but ye know the proof of him that as a son with the father he has served with me in the gospel had timothys presence with st paul at philippi when he preached the gospel there been expressly remarked in the acts of the apostles this quotation might be thought to contain a contrived adaptation to the history although even in that case the averment or rather the allusion in the epistle is too oblique to afford much room for such suspicion but the truth is that in the history of st pauls transactions at philippi which occupies the greatest part of the sixteenth chapter of the acts no mention is made of timothy at all what appears concerning timothy in the history so far as relates to the present subject is this when paul came to derbe and lystra behold a certain disciple was there named timotheus whom paul would have to go forth with him the narrative then proceeds with the account of st pauls progress through various provinces of the lesser asia till it brings him down to troas at troas he was warned in a vision to pass over into macedonia in obedience to which he crossed the aegean sea to samothracia the next day to neapolis and from thence to philippi his preaching miracles and perfecutions at philippi follow next after which paul and his company when they had passed through amphipolis and apollonia came to thessalonica and from thessalonica to beraea from beraea the brethren sent away paul but silas and  timotheus abode there still he itinerary of which the above is an abstract is undoubtedly sufficient to support an inference that timothy was along with st paul at philippi we find them setting out together upon this progress from derbe in lycaonia we find them together near the conclusion of it at beraea in macedonia it is highly probable therefore that they came together to philippi through which their route between these two places lay if this be thought probable it is sufficient for what i wish to be observed is that in comparing upon this subject the epistle with the history we do not find a recital in one place of what is related in another but that we find what is much more to be relied upon an oblique allusion to an implied fact  no v our epistle purports to have been written near the conclusion of st pauls imprisonment at rome and after a residence in that city of considerable duration these circumstances are made out by different intimations and the intimations upon the subject preserve among themselves a just consistency and a consistency certainly unmeditated first the apostle had already been a prisoner at rome so long as that the reputation of his bonds and of his constancy under them had contributed to advance the success of the gospel but i would ye should understand brethren that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel so that my bonds in christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other places and many of the brethren in the lord waxing consident by my bonds are much more bold to speak the word without fear secondly the account given of epaphroditus imports that st paul when he wrote the epistle had been in rome a considerable time he longed after you all and was full of heaviness because that ye had heard that he had been sick epaphroditus was with st paul at rome he had been sick the philippians had heard of his sickness and he again had received an account how much they had been affected by the intelligence the passing and repassing of these advices must necessarily have occupied a large portion of time and must have all taken place during st pauls residence at rome thirdly after a residence at rome thus proved to have been of considerable duration he now regards the decision of his fate as nigh at hand he contemplates either alternative that of his deliverance chapter ii ver    him therefore timothy i hope to send presently so soon as i shall see how it will go with me but i trust in the lord that i also myself shall come shortly that of his condemnation ver    yea and if i be offered  if my blood be poured out as a libation upon the sacrifice of your faith upon the sacrifice and service of your faith i joy and rejoice with you all this consistency is material if the consideration of it be confined to the epistle it is farther material as it agrees with respect to the duration of st pauls first imprisonment at rome with the account delivered in the acts which having brought the apostle to rome closes the history by telling us that he dwelt there two whole years in his own hired house  no vi chap i ver    for i am in a strait betwixt two having a desire to depart and to be with christ which is far better  with this compare   cor chap v ver   we are confident and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the lord  the sameness of sentiment in these two quotations is obvious i rely however not so much upon that as upon the similitude in the train of thought which in each epistle leads up to this sentiment and upon the suitableness of that train of thought to the circumstances under which the epistles purport to have been written this i conceive bespeaks the production of the same mind and of a mind operating upon real circumstances the sentiment is in both places preceded by the contemplation of imminent personal danger to the philippians he writes in the twentieth verse of this chapter according to my earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing i shall be ashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death to the corinthians troubled on every side yet not distressed perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus this train of reflection is continued to the place from whence the words which we compare are taken the two epistles though written at different times from different places and to different churches were both written under circumstances which would naturally recall to the authors mind the precarious condition of his life and the perils which constantly awaited him when the epistle to the philippians was written the author was a prisoner at home expecting his trial when the second epistle to the corinthians was written he had lately escaped a danger in which he had given himself over for lost the epistle opens with a recollection of this subject and the impression accompanied the writers thoughts throughout  i know that nothing is easier than to transplant into a forged epistle a sentiment or expression which is found in a true one or supposing both epistles to be forged by the same hand to insert the same sentiment or expression in both but the difficulty is to introduce it in just and close connection with the train of thought going before and with a train of thought apparently generated by the circumstances under which the epistle is written in two epistles purporting to be written on different occasions and in different periods of the authors history this propriety would not easily be managed  no vii chap i     0 ii     for unto you is given in the behalf of christ not only to believe on him but also to suffer for his sake having the same conflict which ye saw in me and now hear to be in me if there be therefore any consolation in christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfill ye my joy that ye be like minded having the same love being of one accord of one mind  with this compare acts xvi    and the multitude at philippi rose up against them paul and silas and the magistrates rent off their clothes and commanded to beat them and when they had laid many stripes upon them they cast them into prison charging the jailer to keep them safely who having received such a charge thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks  the passage in the epistle is very remarkable i know not an example in any writing of a juster pathos or which more truly represents the workings of a warm and affectionate mind than what is exhibited in the quotation before us the original is very spirited   the apostle reminds his philippians of their being joined with himself in the endurance of persecution for the sake of christ he conjures them by the ties of their common profession and their common sufferings to fulfill his joy to complete by the unity of their faith and by their mutual love that joy with which the instances he had received of their zeal and attachment had inspired his breast now if this was the real effusion of st pauls mind of which it bears the strongest internal character then we have in the words the same conflict which ye saw in me an authentic confirmation of so much of the apostles history in the acts as relates to his transactions at philippi and through that of the intelligence and general fidelity of the historian  chap viii the epistle to the colossians no i there is a circumstance of conformity between st pauls history and his letters especially those which were written during his first imprisonment at rome and more especially the epistles to the colossians and ephesians which being too close to be accounted for from accident yet too indirect and latent to be imputed to design cannot easily be resolved into any other original than truth which circumstance is this that st paul in these epistles attributes his imprisonment not to his preaching of christianity but to his asserting the right of the gentiles to be admitted into it without conforming themselves to the jewish law this was the doctrine to which he considered himself as a martyr thus in the epistle before us chap i ver    i paul who now rejoice in my sufferings for you   for you ie for those whom he had never seen for a few verses afterward he adds i would that ye knew what great conflict i have for you and for them in laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh his sufferings therefore for them was in their general capacity of gentile christians agreeably to what he explicitly declares in his epistle to the ephesians iv   for this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles again in the epistle now under consideration iv   withal praying also for us that god would open unto us a door of utterance to speak the mystery of christ for which i am also in bonds what that mystery of christ was the epistle to the ephesians distinctly informs us whereby when ye read ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that the gentiles should be fellowheirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel this therefore was the confession for which he declares himself to be in bonds now let us enquire how the occasion of st pauls imprisonment is represented in the history the apostle had not long returned to jerusalem from his second visit into greece when an uproar was excited in that city by the clamor of certain asiatic jews who having seen paul in the temple stirred up all the people and laid hands on him the charge advanced against him was that he taught all men every where against the people and the law and this place and farther brought greeks also into the temple and polluted that holy place the former part of the charge seems to point at the doctrine which he maintained of the admission of the gentiles under the new dispensation to an indiscriminate participation of gods favor with the jews but what follows makes the matter clear when by the interference of the chief captain paul had been rescued out of the hands of the populace and was permitted to address the multitude who had followed him to the stairs of the castle he delivered a brief account of his birth of the early course of his life of his miraculous conversion and is proceeding in his narrative until he comes to describe a vision which was presented to him as he was praying in the temple and which bid him depart out of jerusalem for i will send thee far hence unto the gentiles acts xxii    they gave him audience says the historian  unto this word and then lift up their voices and said away with such a fellow from the earth nothing can show more strongly than this account does what was the offense which drew down upon st paul the vengeance of his countrymen his mission to the gentiles and his open avowal of that mission was the intolerable part of the apostles crime but although the real motive of the prosecution appears to have been the apostles conduct toward the gentiles yet when his accusers came before a roman magistrate a charge was to be framed of a more legal form the profanation of the temple was the article they chose to rely upon this therefore became the immediate subject of tertulluss oration before felix and of pauls defense but that he all along considered his ministry amongst the gentiles as the actual source of the enmity that had been exercised against him and in particular as the cause of the insurrection in which his person had been seized is apparent from the conclusion of his discourse before agrippa i have appeared unto thee says he describing what passed upon his journey to damascus for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou have seen and of those things in the which i will appear unto thee delivering thee from the people and from the gentiles unto whom now i send thee to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me whereupon o king agrippa i was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision but showed first unto them of damascus and of jerusalem and throughout all the coasts of judea and then to the gentiles that they should repent and turn to god and do works meet for repentance for these causes the jews caught me in the temple and went about to kill me the seizing therefore of st pauls person from which he was never discharged till his final liberation at rome and of which therefore his imprisonment at rome was the continuation and effect was not in consequence of any general persecution set on foot against christianity nor did it befall him simply as professing or teaching christs religion which james and the elders at jerusalem did as well as he and yet for any thing that appears remained at that time unmolested but it was distinctly and specifically brought upon him by his activity in preaching to the gentiles and by his boldly placing them upon a level with the oncefavoured and still selfslattered posterity of abraham how well st pauls letters purporting to be written during this imprisonment agree with this account of its cause and origin we have already seen  no ii chap iv ver  0 aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you and marcus sisters son to barnabas touching whom ye received commandments if he come unto you receive him and jesus which is called justus who are of the circumcision  we find aristarchus as a companion of our apostle in the nineteenth chapter of the acts and the twentyninth verse and the whole city of ephesus was filled with confusion and having caught gaius and aristarchus men of macedonia pauls companions in travel they rushed with one accord into the theater and we find him upon his journey with st paul to rome in the twentyseventh chapter and the second verse and when it was determined that we should sail into italy they delivered paul and certain other prisoners unto one named julius a centurion of augustuss band and entering into a ship of adramyttium we launched meaning to sail by the coast of asia one aristarchus a macedonian of thessalonica being with us but might not the author of the epistle have consulted the history and observing that the historian had brought aristarchus along with paul to rome might he not for that reason and without any other soundation have put down his name amongst the salutations of an epistle purporting to be written by the apostle from that place i allow so much of possibility to this objection that i should not have proposed this in the number of coincidences clearly undesigned had aristarchus stood alone the observation that strikes me in reading the passage is that together with aristarchus whose journey to rome we trace in the history are joined marcus and justus of whose coming to rome the history says nothing aristarchus alone appears in the history and aristarchus alone would have appeared in the epistle if the author had regulated himself by that conformity or if you take it the other way if you suppose the history to have been made out of the epistle why the journey of aristarchus to rome should be recorded and not that of marcus and justus if the groundwork of the narrative was the appearance of aristarchuss name in the epistle seems to be unaccountable  marcus sisters son to barnabas does not this hint account for barnabass adherence to mark in the contest that arose with our apostle concerning him and some days after paul said unto barnabas let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the lord and see how they do and barnabas determined to take with them john whose surname was mark but paul thought not good to take him with them who departed from pamphylia and went not with them to the work and the contention was so sharp between them that they departed asunder one from the other and so barnabas took mark and sailed unto cyprus the history which records the dispute has not preserved the circumstance of marks relationship to barnabas it is not where noticed but in the text before us as far therefore as it applies the application is certainly undesigned   sisters son to barnabas this woman the mother of mark and the sister of barnabas was as might be expected a person of some eminence amongst the christians of jerusalem it so happens that we hear of her in the history when peter was delivered from prison he came to the house of mary the mother of john whose surname was mark where many were gathered together praying acts xii    there is somewhat of coincidence in this somewhat bespeaking real transactions amongst real persons  no iii the following coincidence though it bear the appearance of great nicety and resinement ought not perhaps to be deemed imaginary in the salutations with which this like most of st pauls epistles concludes we have aristarchus and marcus and jesus which is called justus who are of the circumcision iv  0    then follow also epaphras luke the beloved physician and demas now as this description who are of the circumcision is added after the three first names it is inferred not without great appearance of probability that the rest amongst whom is luke were not of the circumcision now can we discover any expression in the acts of the apostles which ascertains whether the author of the book was a jew or not if we can discover that he was not a jew we fix a circumstance in his character which coincides with what is here indirectly indeed but not very uncertainly intimated concerning luke and we so far confirm both the testimony of the primitive church that the acts of the apostles was written by st luke and the general reality of the persons and circumstances brought together in this epistle the text in the acts which has been construed to show that the writer was not a jew is the nineteenth verse of the first chapter where in describing the field which had been purchased with the reward of judass iniquity it is said that it was known unto all the dwellers at jerusalem insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue aceldama that is to say the field of blood these words are by most commentators taken to be the words and observation of the historian and not a part of st peters speech in the midst of which they are found if this be admitted then it is argued that the expression in their proper tongue would not have been used by a jew but is suitable to the pen of a gentile writing concerning jews vide bensons dissertation vol i p     of his works ed       the reader will judge of the probability of this conclusion and we urge the coincidence no farther than that probability extends the coincidence if it be one is so remote from all possibility of design that nothing need be added to satisfy the reader upon that part of the argument  no iv chap iv ver   with onesimus a faithful and beloved brother who is one of you  observe how it may be made out that onesimus was a colossian turn to the epistle to philemon and you will find that onesimus was the servant or slave of philemon the question therefore will be to what city philemon belonged in the epistle addressed to him this is not declared it appears only that he was of the same place whatever that place was with an eminent christian named archippus paul a prisoner of jesus christ and timothy our brother unto philemon our dearly beloved and fellow laborer and to our beloved apphia and archippus our fellowsoldier and to the church in thy house now turn back to the epistle to the colossians and you will find archippus saluted by name amongst the christians of that church say to archippus take heed to the ministry which thou have received in the lord that thou fulfill it iv    the necessary result is that onesimus also was of the same city agreeably to what is said of him he is one of you and this result is the effect either of truth which produces consistency without the writers thought or care or of a contexture of forgeries confirming and falling in with one another by a species of fortuity of which i know no example the supposition of design i think is excluded not only because the purpose to which the design must have been directed viz the verification of the passage in our epistle in which it is said concerning onesimus he is one of you is a purpose which would be lost upon ninetynine readers out of a hundred but because the means made use of are too circuitous to have been the subject of affectation and contrivance would a forger who had this purpose in view have left his readers to hunt it out by going forward and backward from one epistle to another in order to connect onesimus with philemon philemon with archippus and archippus with colosse all which he must do before he arrive at his discovery that it was truly said of onesimus he is one of you  chap ix the first epistle to the thessalonians no i it is known to every reader of scripture that the first epistle to the thessalonians speaks of the coming of christ in terms which indicate an expectation of his speedy appearance for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds  but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief chap iv          chap v ver    whatever other construction these texts may bear the idea they leave upon the mind of an ordinary reader is that of the author of the epistle looking for the day of judgment to take place in his own time or near to it now the use which i make of this circumstance is to deduce from it a proof that the epistle itself was not the production of a subsequent age would an impostor have given this expectation to st paul after experience had proved it to be erroneous or would he have put into the apostles mouth or which is the same thing into writings purporting to come from his hand expressions if not necessarily conveying at least easily interpreted to convey an opinion which was then known to be founded in mistake i state this as an argument to show that the epistle was cotemporary with st paul which is little less than to show that it actually proceeded from his pen for i question whether any ancient forgeries were executed in the lifetime of the person whose name they bear nor was the primitive situation of the church likely to give birth to such an attempt  no ii our epistle concludes with a direction that it should be publicly read in the church to which it was addressed i charge you by the lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren the existence of this clause in the body of the epistle is an evidence of its authenticity because to produce a letter purporting to have been publicly read in the church of thessalonica when no such letter in truth had been read or heard of in that church would be to produce an imposture destructive of itself at least it seems unlikely that the author of an imposture would voluntarily and even officiously afford a handle to so plain an objection either the epistle was publicly read in the church of thessalonica during st pauls lifetime or it was not if it was no publication could be more authentic no species of notoriety more unquestionable no method of preserving the integrity of the copy more secure if it was not the clause we produce would remain a standing condemnation of the forgery and one would suppose an invincible impediment to its success  if we connect this article with the preceding we shall perceive that they combine into one strong proof of the genuineness of the epistle the preceding article carries up the date of the epistle to the time of st paul the present article sixes the publication of it to the church of thessalonica either therefore the church of thessalonica was imposed upon by a false epistle which in st pauls lifetime they received and read publicly as his carrying on a communication with him all the while and the epistle referring to the continuance of that communication or other christian churches in the same lifetime of the apostle received an epistle purporting to have been publicly read in the church of thessalonica which nevertheless had not been heard of in that church or lastly the conclusion remains that the epistle now in our hands is genuine  no iii between our epistle and the history the accordancy in many points is circumstantial and complete the history relates that after paul and silas had been beaten with many stripes at philippi shut up in the inner prison and their feet made fast in the stocks as soon as they were discharged from their consinement they departed from thence and when they had passed through amphipolis and apollonia came to thessalonica where paul opened and alleged that jesus was the christ acts xvi    etc the epistle written in the name of paul and sylvanus silas and of timotheus who also appears to have been along with them at philippi vide phil no iv speaks to the church of thessalonica thus even after that we had suffered before and were shamefully entreated as ye know at philippi we were bold in our god to speak unto you the gospel of god with much contention ii     the history relates that after they had been some time at thessalonica the jews who believed not set all the city in an uproar and assaulted the house of jason where paul and silas were and sought to bring them out to the people acts xvii   the epistle declares when we were with you we told you before that we should suffer tribulation even as it came to pass and ye know iii    the history brings paul and silas and timothy together at corinth soon after the preaching of the gospel at thessalonica and when silas and timotheus were come from macedonia to corinth paul was pressed in spirit acts xviii   the epistle is written in the name of these three persons who consequently must have been together at the time and speaks throughout of their ministry at thessalonica as a recent transaction we brethren being taken from you for a short time in presence not in heart endeavored the more abundantly to see your face with great desire ii     the harmony is indubitable but the points of history in which it consists are so expressly set sorth in the narrative and so directly referred to in the epistle that it becomes necessary for us to show that the facts in one writing were not copied from the other now amidst some minuter discrepancies which will be noticed below there is one circumstance which mixes itself with all the allusions in the epistle but does not appear in the history any where and that is of a visit which st paul had intended to pay to the thessalonians during the time of his residing at corinth wherefore we would have come unto you even i paul once and again but satan hindered us ii    night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith now god himself and our father and our lord jesus christ direct our way unto you iii  0    concerning a design which was not executed although the person himself who was conscious of his own purpose should make mention in his letters nothing is more probable than that his historian should be silent if not ignorant the author of the epistle could not however have learnt this circumstance from the history for it is not there to be met with nor if the historian had drawn his materials from the epistle is it likely that he would have passed over a circumstance which is amongst the most obvious and prominent of the facts to be collected from that source of information  no iv chap iii    wherefore when we could no longer forbear we thought it good to be left at athens alone and sent timotheus our brother and minister of god to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith  but now when timotheus came from you unto us and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith  the history relates that when paul came out of macedonia to athens silas and timothy staid behind at beraea the brethren sent away paul to go as it were to the sea but silas and timotheus abode there still and they that conducted paul brought him to athens acts chapter xvii ver       the history farther relates that after paul had tarried some time at athens and had proceeded from thence to corinth whilst he was exercising his ministry in that city silas and timothy came to him from macedonia acts chapter xviii ver   but to reconcile the history with the clause in the epistle which makes st paul say i thought it good to be left at athens alone and to send timothy unto you it is necessary to suppose that timothy had come up with st paul at athens a circumstance which the history does not mention i remark therefore that although the history do not expressly notice this arrival yet it contains intimations which render it extremely probable that the fact took place first as soon as paul had reached athens he sent a message back to silas and timothy for to come to him with all speed acts chap xvii ver    secondly his stay at athens was on purpose that they might join him there now whilst paul waited for them at athens his spirit was stirred in him acts chapter xvii ver    thirdly his departure from athens does not appear to have been in any sort hastened or abrupt it is said after these things viz his disputation with the jews his conferences with the philosophers his discourse at areopagus and the gaining of some converts he departed from athens and came to corinth it is not hinted that he quitted athens before the time that he had intended to leave it it is not suggested that he was driven from thence as he was from many cities by tumults or persecutions or because his life was no longer safe observe then the particulars which the history does notice  that paul had ordered timothy to follow him without delay that he waited at athens on purpose that timothy might come up with him that he staid there as long as his own choice led him to continue laying these circumstances which the history does disclose together it is highly probable that timothy came to the apostle at athens a fact which the epistle we have seen virtually asserts when it makes paul send timothy back from athens to thessalonica the sending back of timothy into macedonia accounts also for his not coming to corinth till after paul had been fixed in that city for some considerable time paul had found out aquila and priscilla abode with them and wrought being of the same craft and reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath day and persuaded the jews and the greeks acts chapter xviii ver    all this passed at corinth before silas and timotheus were come from macedonia acts chapter xviii ver   if this was the first time of their coming up with him after their separation at beraea there is nothing to account for a delay so contrary to what appears from the history itself to have been st pauls plan and expectation this is a conformity of a peculiar species the epistle discloses a fact which is not preserved in the history but which makes what is said in the history more significant probable and consistent the history bears marks of an omission the epistle by reference furnishes a circumstance which supplies that omission  no v chap ii ver    for ye brethren became followers of the churches of god which in judea are in christ jesus for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen even as they have of the jews  to a reader of the acts of the apostles it might seem at first sight that the persecutions which the preachers and converts of christianity underwent were suffered at the hands of their old adversaries the jews but if we attend carefully to the accounts there delivered we shall observe that though the opposition made to the gospel usually originated from the enmity of the jews yet in almost all places the jews went about to accomplish their purpose by stirring up the gentile inhabitants against their converted countrymen out of judea they had not power to do much mischief in any other way this was the case at thessalonica in particular the jews which believed not moved with envy set all the city in an uproar acts chapter xvii ver   it was the same a short time afterward at beraea when the jews of thessalonica had knowledge that the word of god was preached of paul at beraea they came thither also and stirred up the people acts chapter xvii ver    and before this our apostle had met with a like species of persecution in his progress through the lesser asia in every city the unbelieving jews stirred up the gentiles and made their minds evil affected against the brethren acts chapter xiv ver   the epistle therefore represents the case accurately as the history states it it was the jews always who set on foot the persecutions against the apostles and their followers he speaks truly therefore of them when he says in this epistle they both killed the lord jesus and their own prophets and have persecuted us  forbidding us to speak unto the gentiles ii       but out of judea it was at the hands of the gentiles it was of their own countrymen that the injuries they underwent were immediately sustained ye have suffered like things of your own countrymen even as they have of the jews  no vi the apparent discrepancies between our epistle and the history though of magnitude sufficient to repel the imputation of confederacy or transcription in which view they form a part of our argument are neither numerous nor very difficult to reconcile  one of these may be observed in the ninth and tenth verses of the second chapter for ye remember brethren our labor and travel for laboring night and day because we would not be chargeable unto any of you we preached unto you the gospel of god ye are witnesses and god also how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe a person who reads this passage is naturally led by it to suppose that the writer had dwelt at thessalonica for some considerable time yet of st pauls ministry in that city the history gives no other account than the following that he came to thessalonica where was a synagogue of the jews that as his manner was he went in unto them and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures that some of them believed and consorted with paul and silas the history then proceeds to tell us that the jews which believed not set the city in an uproar and assaulted the house of jason where paul and his companions lodged that the consequence of this outrage was that the brethren immediately sent away paul and silas by night unto beraea acts chapter xvii ver   0 from the mention of his preaching three sabbath days in the jewish synagogue and from the want of any farther specification of his ministry it has usually been taken for granted that paul did not continue at thessalonica more than three weeks this however is inferred without necessity it appears to have been st pauls practice in almost every place that he came to upon his first arrival to repair to the synagogue he thought himself bound to propose the gospel to the jews first agreeably to what he declared at antioch in pisidia it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you acts chapter xiii ver    if the jews rejected his ministry he quitted the synagogue and betook himself to a gentile audience at corinth upon his first coming thither he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath but when the jews opposed themselves and blasphemed he departed thence expressly telling them from henceforth i will go unto the gentiles and he remained in that city a year and six months acts chapter xviii ver     at ephesus in like manner for the space of three months he went into the synagogue but when diverse were hardened and believed not but spoke evil of that way he departed from them and separated the disciples disputing daily in the school of one tyrannus and this continued by the space of two years acts chapter xix ver    0 upon inspecting the history i see nothing in it which negatives the supposition that st paul pursued the same plan at thessalonica which he adopted in other places and that though he resorted to the synagogue only three sabbath days yet he remained in the city and in the exercise of his ministry amongst the gentile citizens much longer and until the success of his preaching had provoked the jews to excite the tumult and insurrection by which he was driven away  another seeming discrepancy is found in the ninth verse of the first chapter of the epistle for they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had unto you and how ye turned to god from idols to serve the living and true god this text contains an assertion that by means of st pauls ministry at thessalonica many idolatrous gentiles had been brought over to christianity yet the history in describing the effects of that ministry only says that some of the jews believed and of the devout greeks a great multitude and of the chief women not a few chapter xvii ver   the devout greeks were those who already worshipped the one true god and therefore could not be said by embracing christianity to be turned to god from idols  this is the difficulty the answer may be assisted by the following observations the alexandrian and cambridge manuscripts read for  in which reading they are also confirmed by the vulgate latin and this reading is in my opinion strongly supported by the considerations first that  alone i e without  is used in this sense in this same chapter paul being come to athens  secondly that  and  no where come together the expression is redundant the  must be  thirdly that the  is much more likely to have been left out incuria manus than to have been put in or after all if we be not allowed to change the present reading which is undoubtedly retained by a great plurality of copies may not the passage in the history be considered as describing only the effects of st pauls discourses during the three sabbath days in which he preached in the synagogue and may it not be true as we have remarked above that his application to the gentiles at large and his success amongst them was posterior to this  chap x the second epistle to the thessalonians no i it may seem odd to allege obscurity itself as an argument or to draw a proof in favor of a writing from that which is usually considered as the principal defect in its composition the present epistle however furnishes a passage hitherto unexplained and probably inexplicable by us the existence of which under the darkness and difficulties that attend it can only be accounted for upon the supposition of the epistle being genuine and upon that supposition is accounted for with great ease the passage which i allude to is found in the second chapter that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called god or that is worshipped so that he as god sits in the temple of god showing himself that he is god remember ye not that when i was yet with you i told you these things and now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity does already work only he that now lets will let until he be taken out of the way and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming it were superfluous to prove because it is in vain to deny that this passage is involved in great obscurity more especially the clauses distinguished by italics now the observation i have to offer is founded upon this that the passage expressly refers to a conversation which the author had previously holden with the thessalonians upon the same subject remember ye not that when i was yet with you i told you these things and now ye know what withholdeth if such conversation actually passed if whilst he was yet with them he told them those things then it follows that the epistle is authentic and of the reality of this conversation it appears to be a proof that what is said in the epistle might be understood by those who had been present to such conversation and yet be incapable of being explained by any other no man writes unintelligibly on purpose but it may easily happen that a part of a letter which relates to a subject upon which the parties had conversed together before which refers to what had been before said which is in truth a portion or continuation of a former discourse may be utterly without meaning to a stranger who should pick up the letter upon the road and yet be perfectly clear to the person to whom it is directed and with whom the previous communication had passed and if in a letter which thus accidentally fell into my hands i found a passage expressly referring to a former conversation and difficult to be explained without knowing that conversation i should consider this very difficulty as a proof that the conversation had actually passed and consequently that the letter contained the real correspondence of real persons  no ii chap iii ver   neither did we eat any mans bread for naught but wrought with labor night and day that we might not bechargeable to any of you not because we have not power but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow  in a letter purporting to have been written to another of the macedonic churches we find the following declaration  now ye philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel when i departed from macedonia no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving but ye only  the conformity between these two passages is strong and plain they confine the transaction to the same period the epistle to the philippians refers to what passed in the beginning of the gospel that is to say during the first preaching of the gospel on that side of the aegean sea the epistle to the thessalonians speaks of the apostles conduct in that city upon his first entrance in unto them which the history informs us was in the course of his first visit to the peninsula of greece  as st paul tells the philippians that no church communicated with him as concerning giving and receiving but they only he could not consistently with the truth of this declaration have received any thing from the neighboring church of thessalonica what thus appears by general implication in an epistle to another church when he writes to the thessalonians themselves is noticed expressly and particularly neither did we eat any mans bread for naught but wrought night and day that we might not be chargeable to any of you  the texts here cited farther also exhibit a mark of conformity with what st paul is made to say of himself in the acts of the apostles the apostle not only reminds the thessalonians that he had not been chargeable to any of them but he states likewise the motive which dictated this reserve not because we have not power but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us chap iii ver   this conduct and what is much more precise the end which he had in view by it was the very same as that which the history attributes to st paul in a discourse whichit represents him to have addressed to the elders of the church of ephesus yea ye yourselves also know that these hands have ministered unto my necessities and to them that were with me i have showed you all things how that so laboring ye ought to support the weak acts chapter xx ver    the sentiment in the epistle and in the speech is in both parts of it so much alike and yet the words which convey it show so little of imitation or even of resemblance that the agreement cannot well be explained without supposing the speech and the letter to have really procceded from the same person  no iii our reader remembers the passage in the first epistle to the thessalonians in which st paul spoke of the coming of christ this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds and so shall we be ever with the lord  but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief   thessalonians iv      and chapter v ver   it should seem that the thessalonians or some however amongst them had from this passage conceived an opinion and that not very unnaturally that the coming of christ was to take place instantly   nempe hoc anno says grotius  hic dicitur de re praesenti ut romans viii      cor iii    gal i   heb ix    and that this persuasion had produced as it well might much agitation in the church the apostle therefore now writes amongst other purposes to quiet this alarm and to rectify the misconstruction that had been put upon his words now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord jesus christ and by our gathering together unto him that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of christ is at hand if the allusion which we contend for be admitted namely if it be admitted that the passage in the second epistle relates to the passage in the first it amounts to a considerable proof of the genuineness of both epistles i have no conception because i know no example of such a device in a forgery as first to frame an ambiguous passage in a letter then to represent the persons to whom the letter is addressed as mistaking the meaning of the passage and lastly to write a second letter in order to correct this mistake  i have said that this argument arises out of the text if the allusion be admitted for i am not ignorant that many expositors understand the passage in the second epistle as referring to some forged letters which had been produced in st pauls name and in which the apostle had been made to say that the coming of christ was then at hand in defense however of the explanation which we propose the reader is desired to observe    the strong fact that there exists a passage in the first epistle to which that in the second is capable of being referred i e which accounts for the error the writer is solicitous to remove had no other epistle than the second been extant and had it under these circumstances come to be considered whether the text before us related to a forged epistle or to some misconstruction of a true one many conjectures and many probabilities might have been admitted in the enquiry which can have little weight when an epistle is produced containing the very sort of passage we were seeking that is a passage liable to the misinterpretation which the apostle protests against    that the clause which introduces the passage in the second epistle bears a particular affinity to what is found in the passage cited from the first epistle the clause is this we beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord jesus christ and by our gathering together unto him now in the first epistle the description of the coming of christ is accompanied with the mention of this very circumstance of his saints being collected round him the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air   thessalonians chap iv ver       this i suppose to be the gathering together unto him intended in the second epistle and that the author when he used these words retained in his thoughts what he had written on the subject before    the second epistle is written in the joint name of paul sylvanus and timotheus and it cautions the thessalonians against being misled by letter as from us  do not these words  appropriate the reference to some writing which bore the name of these three teachers now this circumstance which is a very close one belongs to the epistle at present in our hands for the epistle which we call the first epistle to the thessalonians contains these names in its superscription    the words in the original as far as they are material to be stated are these  under the weight of the preceding observations may not the words  be construed to signify quasi nos quid tale aut dixerimus aut scripserimus should a contrary interpretation be preferred i do not think that it implies the conclusion that a false epistle had then been published in the apostles name it will completely satisfy the allusion in the text to allow that some one or other at thessalonica had pretended to have been told by st paul and his companions or to have seen a letter from them in which they had said that the day of christ was at hand in like manner as acts xv      it is recorded that some had pretended to have received instructions from the church of jerusalem which had not been received to whom they gave no such commandment and thus dr benson interpreted the passage  nor be dismayed by any revelation or discourse or epistle which any one shall pretend to have heard or received from us  intimating that their words had been mistaken and that they had in truth said or written no such thing  chap xi the first epistle to timothy from the third verse of the first chapter as i besought thee to abide still at ephesus when i went into macedonia it is evident that this epistle was written soon after st paul had gone to macedonia from ephesus dr benson fixes its date to the time of st pauls journey recorded in the beginning of the twentieth chapter of the acts and after the uproar excited by demetrius at ephesus was ceased paul called unto him the disciples and embraced them and departed for to go into macedonia and in this opinion dr benson is followed by michaelis as he was preceded by the greater part of the commentators who have considered the question there is however one objection to the hypothesis which these learned men appear to me to have overlooked and it is no other than this that the superscription of the second epistle to the corinthians seems to prove that at the time st paul is supposed by them to have written this epistle to timothy timothy in truth was with st paul in macedonia paul as it is related in the acts left ephesus for to go into macedonia when he had got into macedonia he wrote his second epistle to the corinthians concerning this point there exists little variety of opinion it is plainly indicated by the contents of the epistle it is also strongly implied that the epistle was written soon after the apostles arrival in macedonia for he begins his letter by a train of reflection referring to his persecutions in asia as to recent transactions as to dangers from which he had lately been delivered but in the salutation with which the epistle opens timothy is joined with st paul and consequently could not at that time be left behind at ephesus and as to the only solution of the difficulty which can be thought of viz that timothy though he was left behind at ephesus upon st pauls departure from asia yet might follow him so soon after as to come up with the apostle in macedonia before he wrote his epistle to the corinthians that supposition is inconsistent with the terms and tenor of the epistle throughout for the writer speaks uniformly of his intention to return to timothy at ephesus and not of his expecting timothy to come to him in macedonia these things write i unto thee hoping to come unto thee shortly but if i tarry long that thou may know how thou ought to behave thyself chap iii ver        till i come give attendance to reading to exhortation to doctrine chap iv ver     since therefore the leaving of timothy behind at ephesus when paul went into macedonia suits not with any journey into macedonia recorded in the acts i concur with bishop pearson in placing the date of this epistle and the journey referred to in it at a period subsequent to st pauls first imprisonment at rome and consequently subsequent to the era up to which the acts of the apostles brings his history the only difficulty which attends our opinion is that st paul must according to us have come to ephesus after his liberation at rome contrary as it should seem to what he foretold to the ephesian elders that they should see his face no more and it is to save the infallibility of this prediction and for no other reason of weight that an earlier date is assigned to this epistle the prediction itself however when considered in connection with the circumstances under which it was delivered does not seem to demand so much anxiety the words in question are found in the twentyfifth verse of the twentieth chapter of the acts and now behold i know that ye all among whom i have gone preaching the kingdom of god shall see my face no more in the twentysecond and twentythird verses of the same chapter i e two verses before the apostle makes this declaration and now behold i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there save that the holy ghost witnesses in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me this witnessing of the holy ghost was undoubtedly prophetic and supernatural but it went no farther than to foretell that bonds and afflictions awaited him and i can very well conceive that this might be all which was communicated to the apostle by extraordinary revelation and that the rest was the conclusion of his own mind the desponding inference which he drew from strong and repeated intimations of approaching danger and the expression i know which st paul here uses does not perhaps when applied to future events affecting himself convey an assertion so positive and absolute as we may at first sight apprehend in the first chapter of the epistle to the philippians and the twentyfifth verse i know says he that i shall abide and continue with you all for your joy and furtherance of faith notwithstanding this strong declaration in the second chapter and twentythird verse of this same epistle and speaking also of the very same event he is content to use a language of some doubt and uncertainty him therefore i hope to send presently so soon as i shall see how it will go with me but i trust in the lord that i also myself shall come shortly and a few verses preceding these he not only seems to doubt of his safety but almost to despair to contemplate the possibility at least of his condemnation and martyrdom yea and if i be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith i joy and rejoice with you all  no i but can we show that st paul visited ephesus after his liberation at rome or rather can we collect any hints from his other letters which make it probable that he did if we can then we have a coincidence if we cannot we have only an unauthorized supposition to which the exigency of the case compels us to resort now for this purpose let us examine the epistle to the philippians and the epistle to philemon these two epistles purport to be written whilst st paul was yet a prisoner at rome to the philippians he writes as follows i trust in the lord that i also myself shall come shortly to philemon who was a colossian he gives this direction but withal prepare me also a lodging for i trust that through your prayers i shall be given unto you an inspection of the map will show us that colosse was a city of the lesser asia lying eastward and at no great distance from ephesus philippi was on the other i e the western side of the aegean sea if the apostle executed his purpose if in pursuance of the intention expressed in his letter to philemon he came to colosse soon after he was set at liberty at rome it is very improbable that he would omit to visit ephesus which lay so near to it and where he had spent three years of his ministry as he was also under a promise to the church of philippi to see them shortly if he passed from colosse to philippi or from philippi to colosse he could hardly avoid taking ephesus in his way  no ii chap v ver   let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old  this accords with the account delivered in the sixth chapter of the acts and in those days when the number of the disciples was multiplied there arose a murmuring of the grecians against the hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration it appears that from the first formation of the christian church provision was made out of the public funds of the society for the indigent widows who belonged to it the history we have seen distinctly records the existence of such an institution at jerusalem a few years after our lords ascension and is led to the mention of it very incidentally viz by a dispute of which it was the occasion and which produced important consequences to the christian community the epistle without being suspected of borrowing from the history refers briefly indeed but decisively to a similar establishment subsisting some years afterward at ephesus this agreement indicates that both writings were founded upon real circumstances  but in this article the material thing to be noticed is the mode of expression let not a widow be taken into the number no previous account or explanation is given to which these words into the number can refer but the direction comes concisely and unpreparedly let not a widow be taken into the number now this is the way in which a man writes who is conscious that he is writing to persons already acquainted with the subject of his letter and who he knows will readily apprehend and apply what he says by virtue of their being so acquainted but it is not the way in which a man writes upon any other occasion and least of all in which a man would draw up a feigned letter or introduce a suppositious fact it is not altogether unconnected with our general purpose to remark in the passage before us the selection and reserve which st paul recommends to the governors of the church of ephesus in the bestowing relief upon the poor because it refutes a calumny which has been insinuated that the liberality of the first christians was an artifice to catch converts or one of the temptations however by which the idle and mendicant were drawn into this society let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old having been the wife of one man well reported of for her good works if she have brought up children if she have lodged strangers if she have washed the saints feet if she have relieved the afflicted if she have diligently followed every good work but the younger widows refuse v    0    and in another place if any man or woman that believes have widows let them relieve them and let not the church be charged that it may relieve them that are widows indeed and to the same effect or rather more to our present purpose the apostle writes in his second epistle to the thessalonians even when we were with you this we commanded you that if any would not work neither let him eat i e at the public expense for we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly working not at all but are busybodies now them that are such we command and exhort by our lord jesus christ that with quietness they work and eat their own bread could a designing or dissolute poor take advantage of bounty regulated with so much caution or could the mind which dictated these sober and prudent directions be influenced in his recommendations of public charity by any other than the properest motives of beneficence   no iii chap iii ver     a bishop must be blameless the husband of one wife vigilant sober of good behavior given to hospitality apt to teach not given to wine no striker not greedy of filthy lucre but patient not a brawler not covetous one that rules well his own house   no striker  that is the article which i single out from the collection as evincing the antiquity at least if not the genuineness of the epistle because it is an article which no man would have made the subject of caution who lived in an advanced era of the church it agreed with the infancy of the society and with no other state of it after the government of the church had acquired the dignified form which it soon and naturally assumed this injunction could have no place would a person who lived under a hierarchy such as the christian hierarchy became when it had settled into a regular establishment have thought it necessary to prescribe concerning the qualification of a bishop that he should be no striker and this injunction would be equally aliene from the imagination of the writer whether he wrote in his own character or personated that of an apostle  no iv chap v ver    drink no longer water but use a little wine for thy stomachs sake and thine often infirmities  imagine an impostor sitting down to forge an epistle in the name of st paul is it credible that it should come into his head to give such a direction as this so remote from every thing of doctrine or discipline every thing of public concern to the religion or the church or to any sect order or party in it and from every purpose with which such an epistle could be written it seems to me that nothing but reality that is the real valetudinary situation of a real person could have suggested a thought of so domestic a nature  but if the peculiarity of the advice be observable the place in which it stands is more so the context is this lay hands suddenly on no man neither be partaker of other mens sins keep thyself pure drink no longer water but use a little wine for thy stomachs sake and thine often infirmities some mens sins are open before hand going before to judgment and some men they follow after the direction to timothy about his diet stands between two sentences as wide from the subject as possible the train of thought seems to be broken to let it in now when does this happen it happens when a man writes as he remembers when he puts down an article that occurs the moment it occurs lest he should afterward forget it of this the passage before us bears strongly the appearance in actual letters in the negligence of a real correspondence examples of this kind frequently take place seldom i believe in any other production for the moment a man regards what he writes as a composition which the author of a forgery would of all others be the first to do notions of order in the arrangement and succession of his thoughts present themselves to his judgment and guide his pen  no v chap i ver       this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom i am chief howbeit for this cause i obtained mercy that in me first jesus christ might show forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe in him to life everlasting  what was the mercy which st paul here commemorates and what was the crime of which he accuses himself is apparent from the verses immediately preceding i thank christ jesus our lord who has enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious but i obtained mercy because i did it ignorantly in unbelief chapter i ver       the whole quotation plainly refers to st pauls original enmity to the christian name the interposition of providence in his conversion and his subsequent designation to the ministry of the gospel and by this reference assirms indeed the substance of the apostles history delivered in the acts but what in the passage strikes my mind most powerfully is the observation that is raised out of the fact for this cause i obtained mercy that in me first jesus christ might show forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting it is a just and solemn reflection springing from the circumstances of the authors conversion or rather from the impression which that great event had left upon his memory it will be said perhaps that an impostor acquainted with st pauls history may have put such a sentiment into his mouth or what is the same thing into a letter drawn up in his name but where we may ask is such an impostor to be found the piety the truth the benevolence of the thought ought to protect it from this imputation for though we should allow that one of the great masters of the ancient tragedy could have given to his scene a sentiment as virtuous and as elevated as this is and at the same time as appropriate and as well suited to the particular situation of the person who delivers it yet whoever is conversant in these enquiries will acknowledge that to do this in a fictitious production is beyond the reach of the understandings which have been employed upon any fabrications that have come down to us under christian names  chap xii the second epistle to timothy no i it was the uniform tradition of the primitive church that st paul visited rome twice and twice there suffered imprisonment and that he was put to death at rome at the conclusion of his second imprisonment this opinion concerning st pauls two journeys to rome is confirmed by a great variety of hints and allusions in the epistle before us compared with what fell from the apostles pen in other letters purporting to have been written from rome that our present epistle was written whilst st paul was a prisoner is distinctly intimated by the eighth verse of the first chapter be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord nor of me his prisoner and whilst he was a prisoner at rome by the sixteenth and seventeenth verses of the same chapter the lord give mercy unto the house of onesiphorus for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain but when he was in rome he sought me out very diligently and found me since it appears from the former quotation that st paul wrote this epistle in confinement it will hardly admit of doubt that the word chain in the latter quotation refers to that consinement the chain by which he was then bound the custody in which he was then kept and if the word chain designate the authors confinement at the time of writing the epistle the next words determine it to have been written from rome he was not ashamed of my chain but when he was in rome he sought me out very diligently now that it was not written during the apostles first imprisonment at rome or during the same imprisonment in which the epistles to the ephesians the colossians the philippians and philemon were written may be gathered with considerable evidence from a comparison of these several epistles with the present  i in the former epistles the author considently looked forward to his liberation from confinement and his speedy departure from rome he tells the philippians chapter ii ver    i trust in the lord that i also myself shall come shortly philemon he bids to prepare for him a lodging for i trust says he that through your prayers i shall be given unto you ver    in the epistle before us he holds a language extremely different i am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day chapter iv ver     ii when the former epistles were written from rome timothy was with st paul and is joined with him in writing to the colossians the philippians and to philemon the present epistle implies that he was absent  iii in the former epistles demas was with st paul at rome luke the beloved physician and demas greet you in the epistle now before us demas has forsaken him having loved this present world and is gone to thessalonica  iv in the former epistle mark was with st paul and joins in saluting the colossians in the present epistle timothy is ordered to bring him with him for he is profitable to me for the ministry chapter iv ver     the case of timothy and of mark might be very well accounted for by supposing the present epistle to have been written before the others so that timothy who is here exhorted to come shortly unto him chapter iv ver   might have arrived and that mark whom he was to bring with him chapter iv ver    might have also reached rome in sufficient time to have been with st paul when the four epistles were written but then such a supposition is inconsistent with what is said of demas by which the posteriority of this to the other epistles is strongly indicated for in the other epistles demas was with st paul in the present he has forsaken him and is gone to thessalonica the opposition also of sentiment with respect to the event of the persecution is hardly reconcilable to the same imprisonment  the two following considerations which were first suggested upon this question by ludovicus capellus are still more conclusive    in the twentieth verse of the fourth chapter st paul informs timothy that erastus abode at corinth  the form of expression implies that erastus had staid behind at corinth when st paul left it but this could not be meant of any journey from corinth which st paul took prior to his first imprisonment at rome for when paul departed from corinth as related in the twentieth chapter of the acts timothy was with him and this was the last time the apostle left corinth before his coming to rome because he left it to proceed on his way to jerusalem soon after his arrival at which place he was taken into custody and continued in that custody till he was carried to caesars tribunal there could be no need therefore to inform timothy that erastus staid behind at corinth upon this occasion because if the fact was so it must have been known to timothy who was present as well as to st paul    in the same verse our epistle also states the following article trophimus have i left at miletum sick when st paul passed through miletum on his way to jerusalem as related acts xx trophimus was not left behind but accompanied him to that city he was indeed the occasion of the uproar at jerusalem in consequence of which st paul was apprehended for they had seen says the historian before with him in the city trophimus an ephesian whom they supposed that paul had brought into the temple this was evidently the last time of pauls being at miletus before his first imprisonment for as has been said after his apprehension at jerusalem he remained in custody till he was sent to rome  in these two articles we have a journey referred to which must have taken place subsequent to the conclusion of st lukes history and of course after st pauls liberation from his first imprisonment the epistle therefore which contains this reference since it appears from other parts of it to have been written whilst st paul was a prisoner at rome proves that he had returned to that city again and undergone there a second imprisonment  i do not produce these particulars for the sake of the support which they lend to the testimony of the fathers concerning st pauls second imprisonment but to remark their consistency and agreement with one another they are all resolvable into one supposition and although the supposition itself be in some sort only negative viz that the epistle was not written during st pauls first residence at rome but in some future imprisonment in that city yet is the consistency not less worthy of observation for the epistle touches upon names and circumstances connected with the date and with the history of the first imprisonment and mentioned in letters written during that imprisonment and so touches upon them as to leave what is said of one consistent with what is said of others and consistent also with what is said of them in different epistles had one of these circumstances been so described as to have fixed the date of the epistle to the first imprisonment it would have involved the rest in contradiction and when the number and particularity of the articles which have been brought together under this head are considered and when it is considered also that the comparisons we have formed amongst them were in all probability neither provided for nor thought of by the writer of the epistle it will be deemed something very like the effect of truth that no invincible repugnancy is perceived between them  no ii in the acts of the apostles in the sixteenth chapter and at the first verse we are told that paul came to derbe and lystra and behold a certain disciple was there named timotheus the son of a certain woman which was a jewess and believed but his father was a greek in the epistle before us in the first chapter and at the fifth verse st paul writes to timothy thus greatly desiring to see thee being mindful of thy tears that i may be filled with joy when i call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelt first in thy grandmother lois and thy mother eunice and i am persuaded that in thee also here we have a fair unforced example of coincidence in the history timothy was the son of a jewess that believed in the epistle st paul applauds the faith which dwelt in his mother eunice in the history it is said of the mother that she was a jewess and believed of the father that he was a greek now when it is said of the mother alone that shebelieved the father being nevertheless mentioned in the same sentence we are led to suppose of the father that he did not believe i e either that he was dead or that he remained unconverted agreeably hereunto whilst praise is bestowed in the epistle upon one parent and upon her sincerity in the faith no notice is taken of the other the mention of the grandmother is the addition of a circumstance not found in the history but it is a circumstance which as well as the names of the parties might naturally be expected to be known to the apostle though overlooked by his historian  no iii chap iii ver    and that from a child thou have known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation  this verse discloses a circumstance which agrees exactly with what is intimated in the quotation from the acts adduced in the last number in that quotation it is recorded of timothys mother that she was a jewess this description is virtually though i am satisfied undesignedly recognized in the epistle when timothy is reminded in it that from a child he had known the holy scriptures the holy scriptures undoubtedly meant the scriptures of the old testament the expression bears that sense in every place in which it occurs those of the new had not yet acquired the name not to mention that in timothys childhood probably none of them existed in what manner then could timothy have known from a child the jewish scriptures had he not been born on one side or on both of jewish parentage perhaps he was not less likely to be carefully instructed in them for that his mother alone professed that religion  no iv chap ii ver    flee also youthful lusts but follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart   flee also youthful lusts the suitableness of this precept to the age of the person to whom it is addressed is gathered from   timothy chapter iv ver    let no man despise thy youth nor do i deem the less of this coincidence because the propriety resides in a single epithet or because this one precept is joined with and followed by a train of others not more applicable to timothy than to any ordinary convert it is in these transient and cursory allusions that the argument is best founded when a writer dwells and rests upon a point in which some coincidence is discerned it may be doubted whether he himself had not fabricated the conformity and was endeavoring to display and set it off but when the reference is contained in a single word unobserved perhaps by most readers the writer passing on to other subjects as unconscious that he had hit upon a correspondency or unsolicitous whether it were remarked or not we may be pretty well assured that no fraud was exercised no imposition intended  no v chap iii ver  0    but thou have fully known my doctrine manner of life purpose faith longsuffering charity patience persecutions afflictions which came unto me at antioch at iconium at lystra what persecutions i endured but out of them all the lord delivered me  the antioch here mentioned was not antioch the capital of syria where paul and barnabas resided a long time but antioch in pisidia to which place paul and barnabas came in their first apostolic progress and where paul delivered a memorable discourse which is preserved in the thirteenth chapter of the acts at this antioch the history relates that the jews stirred up the devout and honorable women and the chief men of the city and raised persecution against paul and barnabas and expelled them out of their coasts but they shook off the dust of their feet against them and came unto iconium and it came to pass in iconium that they went both together into the synagogue of the jews and so spoke that a great multitude both of the jews and also of the greeks believed but the unbelieving jews stirred up the gentiles and made their minds evilaffected against the brethren long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the lord which gave testimony unto the word of his grace and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands but the multitude of the city was divided and part held with the jews and part with the apostles and when there was an assault made both of the gentiles and also of the jews with their rulers to use them despitefully and to stone them they were ware of it and fled unto lystra and derbe cities of lycaonia and unto the region that lies round about and there they preached the gospel and there came thither certain jews from antioch and iconium who persuaded the people and having stoned paul drew him out of the city supposing he had been dead howbeit as the disciples stood round about him he rose up and came into the city and the next day he departed with barnabas to derbe and when they had preached the gospel in that city and had taught many they returned again to lystra and to iconium and to antioch this account comprises the period to which the allusion in the epistle is to be referred we have so far therefore a conformity between the history and the epistle that st paul is asserted in the history to have suffered persecutions in the three cities his persecutions at which are appealed to in the epistle and not only so but to have suffered these persecutions both in immediate succession and in the order in which the cities are mentioned in the epistle the conformity also extends to another circumstance in the apostolic history lystra and derbe are commonly mentioned together in the quotation from the epistle lystra is mentioned and not derbe and the distinction will appear on this occasion to be accurate for st paul is here enumerating his persecutions and although he underwent grievous persecutions in each of the three cities through which he passed to derbe at derbe itself he met with none the next day he departed says the historian to derbe and when they had preached the gospel to that city and had taught many they returned again to lystra the epistle therefore in the names of the cities in the order in which they are enumerated and in the place at which the enumeration stops corresponds exactly with the history  but a second question remains namely how these persecutions were known to timothy or why the apostle should recall these in particular to his remembrance rather than many other persecutions with which his ministry had been attended when some time probably three years afterward  vide pearsons annals paulinas st paul made a second journey through the same country in order to go again and visit the brethren in every city where he had preached the word of the lord we read acts chap xvi ver   that when he came to derbe and lystra behold a certain disciple was there named timotheus one or other therefore of these cities was the place of timothys abode we read moreover that he was well reported of by the brethren that were at lystra and iconium so that he must have been well acquainted with these places also again when paul came to derbe and lystra timothy was already a disciple behold a certain disciple was there named timotheus he must therefore have been converted before but since it is expressly stated in the epistle that timothy was converted by st paul himself that he was his own son in the faith it follows that he must have been converted by him upon his former journey into those parts which was the very time when the apostle underwent the persecutions referred to in the epistle upon the whole then persecutions at the several cities named in the epistle are expressly recorded in the acts and timothys knowledge of this part of st pauls history which knowledge is appealed to in the epistle is fairly deduced from the place of his abode and the time of his conversion it may farther be observed that it is probable from this account that st paul was in the midst of these persecutions when timothy became known to him no wonder then that the apostle though in a letter written long afterward should remind his favorite convert of those scenes of affliction and distress under which they first met  although this coincidence as to the names of the cities be more specific and direct than many which we have pointed out yet i apprehend there is no just reason for thinking it to be artificial for had the writer of the epistle sought a coincidence with the history upon this head and searched the acts of the apostles for the purpose i conceive he would have sent us at once to philippi and thessalonica where paul suffered persecution and where from what is stated it may easily be gathered that timothy accompanied him rather than have appealed to persecutions as known to timothy in the account of which persecutions timothys presence is not mentioned it not being till after one entire chapter and in the history of a journey three years future to this that timothys name occurs in the acts of the apostles for the first time  chap xiii the epistle to titus no i a very characteristic circumstance in this epistle is the quotation from epimenides chap i ver    one of themselves even a prophet of their own said the cretians are always liars evil beasts slow bellies   i call this quotation characteristic because no writer in the new testament except st paul appealed to heathen testimony and because st paul repeatedly did so in his celebrated speech at athens preserved in the seventeenth chapter of the acts he tells his audience that in god we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poets have said for we are also his offspring    the reader will perceive much similarity of manner in these two passages the reference in the speech is to a heathen poet it is the same in the epistle in the speech the apostle urges his hearers with the authority of a poet of their own in the epistle he avails himself of the same advantage yet there is a variation which shows that the hint of inserting a quotation in the epistle was not as it may be suspected borrowed from seeing the like practice attributed to st paul in the history and it is this that in the epistle the author cited is called a prophet one of themselves even a prophet of their own whatever might be the reason for calling epimenides a prophet whether the names of poet and prophet were occasionally convertible whether epimenides in particular had obtained that title as grotius seems to have proved or whether the appellation was given to him in this instance as having delivered a description of the cretan character which the future state of morals amongst them verified whatever was the reason and any of these reasons will account for the variation supposing st paul to have been the author one point is plain namely if the epistle had been forged and the author had inserted a quotation in it merely from having seen an example of the same kind in a speech ascribed to st paul he would so far have imitated his original as to have introduced his quotation in the same manner that is he would have given to epimenides the title which he saw there given to aratus the other side of the alternative is that the history took the hint from the epistle but that the author of the acts of the apostles had not the epistle to titus before him at least that he did not use it as one of the documents or materials of his narrative is rendered nearly certain by the observation that the name of titus does not once occur in his book  it is well known and was remarked by st jerome that the apothegm in the fifteenth chapter of the corinthians evil communications corrupt good manners is an iambic of menanders   here we have another unaffected instance of the same turn and habit of composition probably there are some hitherto unnoticed and more which the loss of the original authors render impossible to be now ascertained  no ii there exists a visible affinity between the epistle to titus and the first epistle to timothy both letters were addressed to persons left by the writer to preside in their respective churches during his absence both letters are principally occupied in describing the qualifications to be sought for in those whom they should appoint to offices in the church and the ingredients of this description are in both letters nearly the same timothy and titus are likewise cautioned against the same prevailing corruptions and in particular against the same misdirection of their cares and studies this affinity obtains not only in the subject of the letters which from the similarity of situation in the persons to whom they were addressed might be expected to be somewhat alike but extends in a great variety of instances to the phrases and expressions the writer accosts his two friends with the same salutation and passes on to the business of his letter by the same transition  unto timothy my own son in the faith grace mercy and peace from god our father and jesus christ our lord as i besought thee to abide still at ephesus when i went into macedonia etc   timothy chap i ver      to titus mine own son after the common faith grace mercy and peace from god the father and the lord jesus christ our savior for this cause left i thee in crete tit chap i ver      if timothy was not to give heed to fables and endless genealogies which minister questions   timothy chap i ver   titus also was to avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions chap iii ver   and was to rebuke them sharply not giving heed to jewish fables chap i ver    if timothy was to be a pattern    timothy chap iv ver    so was titus chap ii ver   if timothy was to let no man despise his youth   timothy chap iv ver    titus also was to let no man despise him chap ii ver    this verbal consent is also observable in some very peculiar expressions which have no relation to the particular character of timothy or titus  the phrase it is a faithful saying  made use of to preface some sentence upon which the writer lays a more than ordinary stress occurs three times in the first epistle to timothy once in the second and once in the epistle before us and in no other part of st pauls writings and it is remarkable that these three epistles were probably all written toward the conclusion of his life and that they are the only epistles which were written after his first imprisonment at rome  the same observation belongs to another singularity of expression and that is in the epithet  sound  as applied to words or doctrine it is thus used twice in the first epistle to timothy twice in the second and three times in the epistle to titus beside two cognate expressions  and  and it is found in the same sense in no other part of the new testament  the phrase god our savior stands in nearly the same predicament it is repeated three times in the first epistle to timothy as many in the epistle to titus and in no other book of the new testament occurs at all except once in the epistle of jude  similar terms intermixed indeed with others are employed in the two epistles in enumerating the qualifications required in those who should be advanced to stations of authority in the church  a bishop must be blameless the husband of one wise vigilant sober of good behavior given to hospitality apt to teach not given to wine no striker not greedy of filthy lucre but patient not a brawler not covetous one that rules well his own house having his children in subjection with all gravity     timothy chap iii ver     if any be blameless the husband of one wife having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly for a bishop must be blameless as the steward of god not selfwilled not soon angry not given to wine no striker not given to filthy lucre but a lover of hospitality a lover of good men sober just holy temperate   titus chapter i ver     the most natural account which can be given of these resemblances is to suppose that the two epistles were written nearly at the same time and whilst the same ideas and phrases dwelt in the writers mind let us enquire therefore whether the notes of time extant in the two epistles in any manner favor this supposition  we have seen that it was necessary to refer the first epistle to timothy to a date subsequent to st pauls first imprisonment at rome because there was no journey into macedonia prior to that event which accorded with the circumstance of leaving timothy behind at ephesus the journey of st paul from crete alluded to in the epistle before us and in which titus was left in crete to set in order the things that were wanting must in like manner be carried to the period which intervened between his first and second imprisonment for the history which reaches we know to the time of st pauls first imprisonment contains no account of his going to crete except upon his voyage as a prisoner to rome and that this could not be the occasion referred to in our epistle is evident from hence that when st paul wrote this epistle he appears to have been at liberty whereas after that voyage he continued for two years at least in confinement again it is agreed that st paul wrote his first epistle to timothy from macedonia as i besought thee to abide still at ephesus when i went or came into macedonia and that he was in these parts i e in this peninsula when he wrote the epistle to titus is rendered probable by his directing titus to come to him to nicopolis when i shall send artemas unto thee or tychicus be diligent make haste to come unto me to nicopolis for i have determined there to winter the most noted city of that name was in epirus near to actium and i think the form of speaking as well as the nature of the case renders it probable that the writer was at nicopolis or in the neighborhood thereof when he dictated this direction to titus  upon the whole if we may be allowed to suppose that st paul after his liberation at rome sailed into asia taking crete in his way that from asia and from ephesus the capital of that country he proceeded into macedonia and crossing the peninsula in his progress came into the neighborhood of nicopolis we have a route which falls in with every thing it executes the intention expressed by the apostle of visiting colosse and philippi as soon as he should be set at liberty at rome it allows him to leave titus at crete and timothy at ephesus as he went into macedonia and to write to both not long after from the peninsula of greece and probably the neighborhood of nicopolis thus bringing together the dates of these two letters and thereby accounting for that affinity between them both in subject and language which our remarks have pointed out i confess that the journey which we have thus traced out for st paul is in a great measure hypothetic but it should be observed that it is a species of consistency which seldom belongs to falsehood to admit of an hypothesis which includes a great number of independent circumstances without contradiction  chap xiv the epistle to philemon no i the singular correspondency between this epistle and that to the colossians has been remarked already an assertion in the epistle to the colossians viz that onesimus was one of them is verified by the epistle to philemon and is verified not by any mention of colosse any the most distant intimation concerning the place of philemons abode but singly by stating onesimus to be philemons servant and by joining in the salutation philemon with archippus for this archippus when we go back to the epistle to the colossians appears to have been an inhabitant of that city and as it should seem to have held an office of authority in that church the case stands thus take the epistle to the colossians alone and no circumstance is discoverable which makes out the assertion that onesimus was one of them take the epistle to philemon alone and nothing at all appears concerning the place to which philemon or his servant onesimus belonged for any thing that is said in the epistle philemon might have been a thessalonian a philippian or an ephesian as well as a colossian put the two epistles together and the matter is clear the reader perceives a junction of circumstances which ascertains the conclusion at once now all that is necessary to be added in this place is that this correspondency evinces the genuineness of one epistle as well as of the other it is like comparing the two parts of a cloven tally coincidence proves the authenticity of both  no ii and this coincidence is perfect not only in the main article of showing by implication onesimus to be a colossian but in many dependent circumstances    i beseech thee for my son onesimus whom i have sent again ver  0   it appears from the epistle to the colossians that in truth onesimus was sent at that time to colosse all my state shall tychicus declare whom i have sent unto you for the same purpose with onesimus a faithful and beloved brother colos chap iv ver       i beseech thee for my son onesimus whom i have begotten in my bonds ver  0 it appears from the preceding quotation that onesimus was with st paul when he wrote the epistle to the colossians and that he wrote that epistle in imprisonment is evident from his declaration in the fourth chapter and third verse praying also for us that god would open unto us a door of utterance to speak the mystery of christ for which i am also in bonds    st paul bids philemon prepare for him a lodging for i trust says he that through your prayers i shall be given unto you this agrees with the expectation of speedy deliverance which he expressed in another epistle written during the same imprisonment him timothy i hope to send presently so soon as i shall see how it will go with me but i trust in the lord that i also myself shall come shortly phil chap ii ver          as the letter to philemon and that to the colossians were written at the same time and sent by the same messenger the one to a particular inhabitant the other to the church of colosse it may be expected that the same or nearly the same persons would be about st paul and join with him as was the practice in the salutations of the epistle accordingly we find the names of aristarchus marcus epaphras luke and demas in both epistles timothy who is joined with st paul in the superscription of the epistle to the colossians is joined with him in this tychicus did not salute philemon because he accompanied the epistle to colosse and would undoubtedly there see him yet the reader of the epistle to philemon will remark one considerable diversity in the catalogue of saluting friends and which shows that the catalogue was not copied from that to the colossians in the epistle to the colossians aristarchus is called by st paul his fellowprisoner colos chap iv ver  0 in the epistle to philemon aristarchus is mentioned without any addition and the title of fellowprisoner is given to epaphras dr benson observes and perhaps truly that the appellation of fellowprisoner as applied by st paul to epaphras did not imply that they were imprisoned together at the time any more than your calling a person your fellowtraveller imports that you are then upon your travels if he had upon any former occasion traveled with you you might afterward speak of him under that title it is just so with the term fellowprisoner   and let it also be observed that notwithstanding the close and circumstantial agreement between the two epistles this is not the case of an opening left in a genuine writing which an impostor is induced to fill up nor of a reference to some writing not extant which sets a sophist at work to supply the loss in like manner as because st paul was supposed colos chap iv ver    to allude to an epistle written by him to the laodiceans some person has from thence taken the hint of uttering a forgery under that title the present i say is not that case for philemons name is not mentioned in the epistle to the colossians onesimuss servile condition is no where hinted at any more than his crime his flight or the place or time of his conversion the story therefore of the epistle if it be a fiction is a fiction to which the author could not have been guided by any thing he had read in st pauls genuine writings  no iii ver     i thank my god making mention of thee always in my prayers hearing of thy love and faith which thou have toward the lord jesus and toward all saints   hearing of thy love and faith this is the form of speech which st paul was wont to use toward those churches which he had not seen or then visited see romans chap i ver   ephesians chap i ver    col chap i ver     toward those churches and persons with whom he was previously acquainted he employed a different phrase as i thank my god always on your behalf   cor chap i ver     thessalonians chap i ver   or upon every remembrance of you phil chap i ver     thessalonians chap i ver       timothy chap i ver   and never speaks of hearing of them yet i think it must be concluded from the nineteenth verse of this epistle that philemon had been converted by st paul himself albeit i do not say to thee how thou owe unto me even thine own self besides here then is a peculiarity let us enquire whether the epistle supplies any circumstance which will account for it we have seen that it may be made out not from the epistle itself but from a comparison of the epistle with that to the colossians that philemon was an inhabitant of colosse and it farther appears from the epistle to the colossians that st paul had never been in that city i would that ye knew what great conflict i have for you and for them at laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh col chapter ii ver   although therefore st paul had formerly met with philemon at some other place and had been the immediate instrument of his conversion yet philemons faith and conduct afterward inasmuch as he lived in a city which st paul had never visited could only be known to him by fame and reputation  no iv the tenderness and delicacy of this epistle have been long admired though i might be much bold in christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient yet for loves sake i rather beseech thee being such a one as paul the aged and now also a prisoner of jesus christ i beseech thee for my son onesimus whom i have begotten in my bonds there is something certainly very melting and persuasive in this and every part of the epistle yet in my opinion the character of st paul prevails in it throughout the warm affectionate authoritative teacher is interceding with an absent friend for a beloved convert he urges his suit with an earnestness befitting perhaps not so much the occasion as the ardour and sensibility of his own mind here also as every where he shows himself conscious of the weight and dignity of his mission nor does he suffer philemon for a moment to forget it i might be much bold in christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient he is careful also to recall though obliquely to philemons memory the sacred obligation under which he had laid him by bringing to him the knowledge of jesus christ i do not say to thee how thou owe to me even thine own self besides without laying aside therefore the apostolic character our author softens the imperative style of his address by mixing with it every sentiment and consideration that could move the heart of his correspondent aged and in prison he is content to supplicate and entreat onesimus was rendered dear to him by his conversion and his services the child of his affliction and ministering unto him in the bonds of the gospel this ought to recommend him whatever had been his fault to philemons forgiveness receive him as myself as my own bowels every thing however should be voluntary st paul was determined that philemons compliance should flow from his own bounty without thy mind would i do nothing that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity but willingly trusting nevertheless to his gratitude and attachment for the performance of all that he requested and for more having confidence in thy obedience i wrote unto thee knowing that thou will also do more than i say  st pauls discourse at miletus his speech before agrippa his epistle to the romans as has been remarked no viii that to the galatians chap iv ver    0 to the philippians chap i ver   chapter ii ver   the second to the corinthians chap vi ver      and indeed some part or other of almost every epistle exhibits examples of a similar application to the feelings and affections of the persons whom he addresses and it is observable that these pathetic effusions drawn for the most part from his own sufferings and situation usually precede a command soften a rebuke or mitigate the harshness of some disagreeable truth  chap xv the subscriptions of the epistles six of these subscriptions are false or improbable that is they are either absolutely contradicted by the contents of the epistle or are difficult to be reconciled with them  i the subscription of the first epistle to the corinthians states that it was written from philippi notwithstanding that in the sixteenth chapter and the eighth verse of the epistle st paul informs the corinthians that he will tarry at ephesus until pentecost and notwithstanding that he begins the salutations in the epistle by telling them the churches of asia salute you a pretty evident indication that he himself was in asia at this time  ii the epistle to the galatians is by the subscription dated from rome yet in the epistle itself st paul expresses his surprise that they were so soon removed from him that called them whereas his journey to rome was ten years posterior to the conversion of the galatians and what i think is more conclusive the author though speaking of himself in this more than any other epistle does not once mention his bonds or call himself a prisoner which he has not failed to do in every one of the four epistles written from that city and during that imprisonment  iii the first epistle to the thessalonians was written the subscription tells us from athens yet the epistle refers expressly to the coming of timotheus from thessalonica chapter iii ver   and the history informs us acts xviii ver   that timothy came out of macedonia to st paul at corinth  iv the second epistle to the thessalonians is dated and without any discoverable reason from athens also if it be truly the second if it refer as it appears to do chapter ii ver   to the first and the first was written from corinth the place must be erroneously assigned for the history does not allow us to suppose that st paul after he had reached corinth went back to athens  v the first epistle to timothy the subscription asserts to have been sent from laodicea yet when st paul writes i besought thee to abide still at ephesus  when i set out for macedonia the reader is naturally led to conclude that he wrote the letter upon his arrival in that country  vi the epistle to titus is dated from nicopolis in macedonia whilst no city of that name is known to have existed in that province  the use and the only use which i make of these observations is to show how easily errors and contradictions steal in where the writer is not guided by original knowledge there are only eleven distinct assignments of date to st pauls epistles for the four written from rome may be considered as plainly cotemporary and of these six seem to be erroneous i do not attribute any authority to these subscriptions i believe them to have been conjectures founded sometimes upon loose traditions but more generally upon a consideration of some particular text without sufficiently comparing it with other parts of the epistle with different epistles or with the history suppose then that the subscriptions had come down to us as authentic parts of the epistles there would have been more contrarieties and difficulties arising out of these final verses than from all the rest of the volume yet if the epistles had been forged the whole must have been made up of the same elements as those of which the subscriptions are composed viz tradition conjecture and inference and it would have remained to be accounted for how whilst so many errors were crowded into the concluding clauses of the letters so much consistency should be preserved in other parts  the same reflection arises from observing the oversights and mistakes which learned men have committed when arguing upon allusions which relate to time and place or when endeavoring to digest scattered circumstances into a continued story it is indeed the same case for these subscriptions must be regarded as ancient scholia and as nothing more of this liability to error i can present the reader with a notable instance and which i bring forward for no other purpose than that to which i apply the erroneous subscriptions ludovicus capellus in that part of his historia apostolica illustrata which is entitled de ordine epist paul writing upon the second epistle to the corinthians triumphs unmercifully over the want of sagacity in baronius who it seems makes st paul write his epistle to titus from macedonia upon his second visit into that province whereas it appears from the history that titus instead of being in crete where the epistle places him was at that time sent by the apostle from macedonia to corinth animadvertere est says capellus magnam hominis illius  qui vult titum a paulo in cretam abductum illicque relictum cum inde nicopolim navigaret quem tamen agnoscit a paulo ex macedonia missum esse corinthum this probably will be thought a detection of inconsistency in baronius but what is the most remarkable is that in the same chapter in which he thus indulges his contempt of baroniuss judgment capellus himself falls into an error of the same kind and more gross and palpable than that which he reproves for he begins the chapter by stating the second epistle to the corinthians and the first epistle to timothy to be nearly cotemporary to have been both written during the apostles second visit into macedonia and that a doubt subsisted concerning the immediate priority of their dates posterior ad eosdem corinthios epistola et prior ad timotheum certant de prioritate et sub judice lis est utraque autem scripta est paulo postquam paulus epheso discessisset adeoque dum macedoniam peragraret sed utra tempore praecedat non liquet now in the first place it is highly improbable that the two epistles should have been written either nearly together or during the same journey through macedonia for in the epistle to the corinthians timothy appears to have been with st paul in the epistle addressed to him to have been left behind at ephesus and not only left behind but directed to continue there till st paul should return to that city in the second place it is inconceivable that a question should be proposed concerning the priority of date of the two epistles for when st paul in his epistle to timothy opens his address to him by saying as i besought thee to abide still at ephesus when i went into macedonia no reader can doubt but that he here refers to the last interview which had passed between them that he had not seen him since whereas if the epistle be posterior to that to the corinthians yet written upon the same visit into macedonia this could not be true for as timothy was along with st paul when he wrote to the corinthians he must upon this supposition have passed over to st paul in macedonia after he had been left by him at ephesus and must have returned to ephesus again before the epistle was written what misled ludovicus capellus was simply this that he had entirely overlooked timothys name in the superscription of the second epistle to the corinthians which oversight appears not only in the quotation which we have given but from his telling us as he does that timothy came from ephesus to st paul at corinth whereas the superscription proves that timothy was already with st paul when he wrote to the corinthians from macedonia  chap xvi the conclusion in the outset of this enquiry the reader was directed to consider the acts of the apostles and the thirteen epistles of st paul as certain ancient manuscripts lately discovered in the closet of some celebrated library we have adhered to this view of the subject external evidence of every kind has been removed out of sight and our endeavors have been employed to collect the indications of truth and authenticity which appeared to exist in the writings themselves and to result from a comparison of their different parts it is not however necessary to continue this supposition longer the testimony which other remains of cotemporary or the monuments of adjoining ages afford to the reception notoriety and public estimation of a book form no doubt the first proof of its genuineness and in no books whatever is this proof more complete than in those at present under our consideration the enquiries of learned men and above all of the excellent lardner who never overstates a point of evidence and whose fidelity in citing his authorities has in no one instance been impeached have established concerning these writings the following propositions  i that in the age immediately posterior to that in which st paul lived his letters were publicly read and acknowledged  some of them are quoted or alluded to by almost every christian writer that followed by clement of rome by hermas by ignatius by polycarp disciples or cotemporaries of the apostles by justin martyr by the churches of gaul by irenaeus by athenagoras by theophilus by clement of alexandria by hermias by tertullian who occupied the succeeding age now when we find a book quoted or referred to by an ancient author we are entitled to conclude that it was read and received in the age and country in which that author lived and this conclusion does not in any degree rest upon the judgment or character of the author making such reference proceeding by this rule we have concerning the first epistle to the corinthians in particular within forty years after the epistle was written evidence not only of its being extant at corinth but of its being known and read at rome clement bishop of that city writing to the church of corinth uses these words take into your hands the epistle of the blessed paul the apostle what did he at first write unto you in the beginning of the gospel verily he did by the spirit admonish you concerning himself and cephas and apollos because that even then you did form parties see lardner vol xii p     this was written at a time when probably some must have been living at corinth who remembered st pauls ministry there and the receipt of the epistle the testimony is still more valuable as it shows that the epistles were preserved in the churches to which they were sent and that they were spread and propagated from them to the rest of the christian community agreeably to which natural mode and order of their publication tertullian a century afterward for proof of the integrity and genuineness of the apostolic writings bids any one who is willing to exercise his curiosity profitably in the business of their salvation to visit the apostolical churches in which their very authentic letters are recited ipsae authenticae literae eorum recitantur then he goes on is achaia near you you have corinth if you are not far from macedonia you have philippi you have thessalonica if you can go to asia you have ephesus but if you are near to italy you have rome lardner vol ii p      i adduce this passage to show that the distinct churches or christian societies to which st pauls epistles were sent subsisted for some ages afterward that his several epistles were all along respectively read in those churches that christians at large received them from those churches and appealed to those churches for their original and authenticity  arguing in like manner from citations and allusions we have within the space of a hundred and fifty years from the time that the first of st pauls epistles was written proofs of almost all of them being read in palestine syria the countries of asia minor in egypt in that part of africa which used the latin tongue in greece italy and gaul see lardners recapitulation vol xii p     i do not mean simply to assert that within the space of a hundred and fifty years st pauls epistles were read in those countries for i believe that they were read and circulated from the beginning but that proofs of their being so read occur within that period and when it is considered how few of the primitive christians wrote and of what was written how much is lost we are to account it extraordinary or rather as a sure proof of the extensiveness of the reputation of these writings and of the general respect in which they were held that so many testimonies and of such antiquity are still extant in the remaining works of irenaeus clement of alexandria and tertullian there are perhaps more and larger quotations of the small volume of the new testament than of all the works of cicero in the writings of all characters for several ages vide lardners recapitulation vol xii p     we must add that the epistles of paul come in for their full share of this observation and that all the thirteen epistles except that to philemon which is not quoted by irenaeus or clement and which probably escaped notice merely by its brevity are severally cited and expressly recognized as st pauls by each of these christian writers the ebionites an early though inconsiderable christian sect rejected st paul and his epistles lardner vol ii p  0   that is they rejected these epistles not because they were not but because they were st pauls and because adhering to the obligation of the jewish law they chose to dispute his doctrine and authority their suffrage as to the genuineness of the epistles does not contradict that of other christians marcion an heretical writer in the former part of the second century is said by tertullian to have rejected three of the epistles which we now receive viz the two epistles to timothy and the epistle to titus it appears to me not improbable that marcion might make some such distinction as this that no apostolic epistle was to be admitted which was not read or attested by the church to which it was sent for it is remarkable that together with these epistles to private persons he rejected also the catholic epistles now the catholic epistles and the epistles to private persons agree in the circumstance of wanting this particular species of attestation marcion it seems acknowledged the epistle to philemon and is upbraided for his inconsistency in doing so by tertullian lardner vol xiv p      who asks why when he received a letter written to a single person he should refuse two to timothy and one to titus composed upon the affairs of the church this passage so far favors our account of marcions objection as it shows that the objection was supposed by tertullian to have been founded in something which belonged to the nature of a private letter  nothing of the works of marcion remains probably he was after all a rash arbitrary licentious critic if he deserved indeed the name of critic and who offered no reason for his determination what st jerome says of him intimates this and is beside founded in good sense speaking of him and basilides if they had assigned any reasons says he why they did not reckon these epistles viz the first and second to timothy and the epistle to titus to be the apostles we would have endeavored to have answered them and perhaps might have satisfied the reader but when they take upon them by their own authority to pronounce one epistle to be pauls and another not they can only be replied to in the same manner lardner vol xiv p      let it be remembered however that marcion received ten of these epistles his authority therefore even if his credit had been better than it is forms a very small exception to the uniformity of the evidence of basilides we know still less than we do of marcion the same observation however belongs to him viz that his objection as far as appears from this passage of st jerome was confined to the three private epistles yet is this the only opinion which can be said to disturb the consent of the two first centuries of the christian era for as to tatian who is reported by jerome alone to have rejected some of st pauls epistles the extravagant or rather delirious notions into which he fell take away all weight and credit from his judgment if indeed jeromes account of this circumstance be correct for it appears from much older writers than jerome that tatian owned and used many of these epistles lardner vol i p       ii they who in those ages disputed about so many other points agreed in acknowledging the scriptures now before us contending sects appealed to them in their controversies with equal and unreserved submission when they were urged by one side however they might be interpreted or misinterpreted by the other their authority was not questioned reliqui omnes says irenaeus speaking of marcion falso scientiae nomine inflati scripturas quidem confitentur interpretationes vero convertunt iren advers haer quoted by lardner vol xv p       iii when the genuineness of some other writings which were in circulation and even of a few which are now received into the canon was contested these were never called into dispute whatever was the objection or whether in truth there ever was any real objection to the authenticity of the second epistle of peter the second and third of john the epistle of james or that of jude or to the book of the revelations of st john the doubts that appear to have been entertained concerning them exceedingly strengthen the force of the testimony as to those writings about which there was no doubt because it shows that the matter was a subject amongst the early christians of examination and discussion and that where there was any room to doubt they did doubt  what eusebius has left upon the subject is directly to the purpose of this observation eusebius it is well known divided the ecclesiastical writings which were extant in his time into three classes the  uncontradicted as he calls them in one chapter or scriptures universally acknowledged as he calls them in another the controverted yet well known and approved by many and the spurious what were the shades of difference in the books of the second or in those of the third class or what it was precisely that he meant by the term spurious it is not necessary in this place to enquire it is sufficient for us to find that the thirteen epistles of st paul are placed by him in the first class without any sort of hesitation or doubt  it is farther also to be collected from the chapter in which this distinction is laid down that the method made use of by eusebius and by the christians of his time viz the close of the third century in judging concerning the sacred authority of any books was to enquire after and consider the testimony of those who lived near the age of the apostles lardner vol viii p  0    iv that no ancient writing which is attested as these epistles are has had its authenticity disproved or is in fact questioned the controversies which have been moved concerning suspected writings as the epistles for instance of phalaris or the eighteen epistles of cicero begin by showing that this attestation is wanting that being proved the question is thrown back upon internal marks of spuriousness or authenticity and in these the dispute is occupied in which disputes it is to be observed that the contested writings are commonly attacked by arguments drawn from some opposition which they betray to authentic history to true epistles to the real sentiments or circumstances of the author whom they personate see the tracts written in the controversy between tunstal and middleton upon certain suspected epistles ascribed to cicero  which authentic history which true epistles which real sentiments themselves are no other than ancient documents whose early existence and reception can be proved in the manner in which the writings before us are traced up to the age of their reputed author or to ages near to his a modern who sits down to compose the history of some ancient period has no stronger evidence to appeal to for the most confident assertion or the most undisputed fact that he delivers than writings whose genuineness is proved by the same medium through which we evince the authenticity of ours nor whilst he can have recourse to such authorities as these does he apprehend any uncertainty in his accounts from the suspicion of spuriousness or imposture in his materials  v it cannot be shown that any forgeries properly so called i believe that there is a great deal of truth in dr lardners observations that comparatively few of those books which we call apocryphal were strictly and originally forgeries see lardner vol xii p      that is writings published under the name of the person who did not compose them made their appearance in the first century of the christian era in which century these epistles undoubtedly existed i shall set down under this proposition the guarded words of lardner himself there are no quotations of any of them spurious and apocryphal books in the apostolical fathers by whom i mean barnabas clement of rome hermas ignatius and polycarp whose writings reach from the year of our lord  0 to the year  0  i say this confidently because i think it has been proved lardner vol xii p      nor when they did appear were they much used by the primitive christians irenaeus quotes not any of these books he mentions some of them but he never quotes them the same may be said of tertullian he has mentioned a book called acts of paul and thecla but it is only to condemn it clement of alexandria and origin have mentioned and quoted several such books but never as authority and sometimes with express marks of dislike eusebius quotes no such books in any of his works he has mentioned them indeed but how not by way of approbation but to show that they were of little or no value and that they never were received by the sounder part of christians now if with this which is advanced after the most minute and diligent examination we compare what the same cautious writer had before said of our received scriptures that in the works of three only of the abovementioned fathers there are more and larger quotations of the small volume of the new testament than of all the works of cicero in the writers of all characters for several ages and if with the marks of obscurity or condemnation which accompanied the mention of the several apocryphal christian writings when they happened to be mentioned at all we contrast what dr lardners work completely and in detail makes out concerning the writings which we defend and what having so made out he thought himself authorized in his conclusion to assert that these books were not only received from the beginning but received with the greatest respect have been publicly and solemnly read in the assemblies of christians throughout the world in every age from that time to this early translated into the languages of diverse countries and people commentaries writ to explain and illustrate them quoted by way of proof in all arguments of a religious nature recommended to the perusal of unbelievers as containing the authentic account of the christian doctrine when we attend i say to this representation we perceive in it not only full proof of the early notoriety of these books but a clear and sensible line of discrimination which separates these from the pretensions of any others  the epistles of st paul stand particularly free of any doubt or confusion that might arise from this source until the conclusion of the fourth century no intimation appears of any attempt whatever being made to counterfeit these writings and then it appears only of a single and obscure instance jerome who flourished in the year     has this expression legunt quidam et ad laodicenses sed ab omnibus exploditur there is also an epistle to the laodiceans but it is rejected by every body lardner vol x p  0   theodoret who wrote in the year     speaks of this epistle in the same terms lardner vol xi p     beside these i know not whether any ancient writer mentions it it was certainly unnoticed during the three first centuries of the church and when it came afterward to be mentioned it was mentioned only to show that though such a writing did exist it obtained no credit it is probable that the forgery to which jerome alludes is the epistle which we now have under that title if so as has been already observed it is nothing more than a collection of sentences from the genuine epistles and was perhaps at first rather the exercise of some idle pen than any serious attempt to impose a forgery upon the public of an epistle to the corinthians under st pauls name which was brought into europe in the present century antiquity is entirely silent it was unheard of for sixteen centuries and at this day though it be extant and was first found in the armenian language it is not by the christians of that country received into their scriptures i hope after this that there is no reader who will think there is any competition of credit or of external proof between these and the received epistles or rather who will not acknowledge the evidence of authenticity to be confirmed by the want of success which attended imposture  when we take into our hands the letters which the suffrage and consent of antiquity has thus transmitted to us the first thing that strikes our attention is the air of reality and business as well as of seriousness and conviction which pervades the whole let the skeptic read them if he be not sensible of these qualities in them the argument can have no weight with him if he be if he perceive in almost every page the language of a mind actuated by real occasions and operating upon real circumstances i would wish it to be observed that the proof which arises from this perception is not to be deemed occult or imaginary because it is incapable of being drawn out in words or of being conveyed to the apprehension of the reader in any other way than by sending him to the books themselves  and here in its proper place comes in the argument which it has been the office of these pages to unfold st pauls epistles are connected with his history by their particularity and by the numerous circumstances which are found in them when we descend to an examination and comparion of these circumstances we not only observe the history and the epistles to be independent documents unknown to or at least unconsulted by each other but we find the substance and oftentimes very minute articles of the history recognized in the epistles by allusions and references which can neither be imputed to design nor without a foundation in truth be accounted for by accident by hints and expressions and single words dropping as it were fortuitously from the pen of the writer or drawn forth each by some occasion proper to the place in which it occurs but widely removed from any view to consistency or agreement these we know are effects which reality naturally produces but which without reality at the bottom can hardly be conceived to exist  when therefore with a body of external evidence which is relied upon and which experience proves may safely be relied upon in appreciating the credit of ancient writings we combine characters of genuineness and originality which are not found and which in the nature and order of things cannot be expected to be found in spurious compositions whatever difficulties we may meet with in other topics of the christian evidence we can have little in yielding our assent to the following conclusions that there was such a person as st paul that he lived in the age which we ascribe to him that he went about preaching the religion of which jesus christ was the founder and that the letters which we now read were actually written by him upon the subject and in the course of that his ministry  and if it be true that we are in possession of the very letters which st paul wrote let us consider what confirmation they afford to the christian history in my opinion they substantiate the whole transaction the great object of modern research is to come at the epistolary correspondence of the times a midst the obscurities the silence or the contradictions of history if a letter can be found we regard it as the discovery of a landmark as that by which we can correct adjust or supply the imperfections and uncertainties of other accounts one cause of the superior credit which is attributed to letters is this that the facts which they disclose generally come out incidentally and therefore without design to mislead the public by false or exaggerated accounts this reason may be applied to st pauls epistles with as much justice as to any letters whatever nothing could be farther from the intention of the writer than to record any part of his history that his history was in fact made public by these letters and has by the same means been transmitted to future ages is a secondary and unthought of effect the sincerity therefore of the apostles declarations cannot reasonably be disputed at least we are sure that it was not vitiated by any desire of setting himself off to the public at large but these letters form a part of the muniments of christianity as much to be valued for their contents as for their originality a more inestimable treasure the care of antiquity could not have sent down to us beside the proof they afford of the general reality of st pauls history of the knowledge which the author of the acts of the apostles had obtained of that history and the consequent probability that he was what he professes himself to have been a companion of the apostles beside the support they lend to these important inferences they meet specisically some of the principal objections upon which the adversaries of christianity have thought proper to rely in particular they show  i that christianity was not a story set on foot amidst the confusions which attended and immediately preceded the destruction of jerusalem when many extravagant reports were circulated when mens minds were broken by terror and distress when amidst the tumults that surrounded them enquiry was impracticable these letters show incontestably that the religion had sixed and established itself before this state of things took place  ii whereas it has been insinuated that our gospels may have been made up of reports and stories which were current at the time we may observe that with respect to the epistles this is impossible a man cannot write the history of his own life from reports nor what is the same thing be led by reports to refer to passages and transactions in which he states himself to have been immediately present and active i do not allow that this insinuation is applied to the historical part of the new testament with any color of justice or probability but i say that to the epistles it is not applicable at all  iii these letters prove that the converts to christianity were not drawn from the barbarous the mean or the ignorant set of men which the representations of infidelity would sometimes make them we learn from letters the character not only of the writer but in some measure of the persons to whom they are written to suppose that these letters were addressed to a rude tribe incapable of thought or reflection is just as reasonable as to suppose lockes essay on the human understanding to have been written for the instruction of savages whatever may be thought of these letters in other respects either of diction or argument they are certainly removed as far as possible from the habits and comprehension of a barbarous people  iv st pauls history i mean so much of it as may be collected from his letters is so implicated with that of the other apostles and with the substance indeed of the christian history itself that i apprehend it will be found impossible to admit st pauls story i do not speak of the miraculous part of it to be true and yet to reject the rest as fabulous for instance can any one believe that there was such a man as paul a preacher of christianity in the age which we assign to him and not believe that there were also at the same time such men as peter and james and other apostles who had been companions of christ during his life and who after his death published and avowed the same things concerning him which paul taught judea and especially jerusalem was the scene of christs ministry the witnesses of his miracles lived there st paul by his own account as well as that of his historian appears to have frequently visited this city to have carried on a communication with the church there to have associated with the rulers and elders of that church who were some of them apostles to have acted as occasions offered in correspondence and sometimes in conjuntion with them can it after this be doubted but that the religion and the general facts relating to it which st paul appears by his letters to have delivered to the several churches which he established at a distance were at the same time taught and published at jerusalem itself the place where the business was transacted and taught and published by those who had attended the founder of the institution in his miraculous or pretendedly miraculous ministry  it is observable for so it appears both in the epistles and from the acts of the apostles that jerusalem and the society of believers in that city long continued the center from which the missionaries of the religion issued with which all other churches maintained a correspondence and connection to which they referred their doubts and to whose relief in times of public distress they remitted their charitable assistance this observation i think material because it proves that this was not the case of giving out accounts in one country of what is transacted in another without affording the hearers an opportunity of knowing whether the things related were credited by any or even published in the place where they are reported to have passed  v st pauls letters furnish evidence and what better evidence than a mans own letters can be desired of the soundness and sobriety of his judgment his caution in distinguishing between the occasional suggestions of inspiration and the ordinary exercise of his natural understanding is without example in the history of human enthusiasm his morality is every where calm pure and rational adapted to the condition the activity and the business of social life and of its various relations free from the overscrupulousness and austerities of superstition and from what was more perhaps to be apprehended the abstractions of quietism and the soarings or extravagancies of fanaticism his judgment concerning a hesitating conscience his opinion of the moral indifferency of many actions yet of the prudence and even the duty of compliance where noncompliance would produce evil effects upon the minds of the persons who observed it is as correct and just as the most liberal and enlightened moralist could form at this day the accuracy of modern ethics has found nothing to amend in these determinations  what lord lyttelton has remarked of the preference ascribed by st paul to inward rectitude of principle above every other religious accomplishment is very material to our present purpose in his first epistle to the corinthians chapter xiii ver    st paul has these words though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity i am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profits me nothing is this the language of enthusiasm did ever enthusiast prefer that universal benevolence which comprehends all moral virtues and which as appears by the following verses is meant by charity here did ever enthusiast i say prefer that benevolence which we may add is attainable by every man to faith and to miracles to those religious opinions which he had embraced and to those supernatural graces and gifts which he imagined he had acquired nay even to the merit of martyrdom is it not the genius of enthusiasm to set moral virtues infinitely below the merit of faith and of all moral virtues to value that least which is most particularly enforced by st paul a spirit of candor moderation and peace certainly neither the temper nor the opinions of a man subject to fanatic delusions are to be found in this passage  lord lytteltons considerations on the conversion etc  i see no reason therefore to question the integrity of his understanding to call him a visionary because he appealed to visions or an enthusiast because he pretended to inspiration is to take the whole question for granted it is to take for granted that no such visions or inspirations existed at least it is to assume contrary to his own assertions that he had no other proofs than these to offer of his mission or of the truth of his relations  one thing i allow that his letters every where discover great zeal and earnestness in the cause in which he was engaged that is to say he was convinced of the truth of what he taught he was deeply impressed but not more so than the occasion merited with a sense of its importance this produces a corresponding animation and solicitude in the exercise of his ministry but would not these considerations supposing them to be well founded have holden the same place and produced the same effect in a mind the strongest and the most sedate  vi these letters are decisive as to the sufferings of the author also as to the distressed state of the christian church and the dangers which attended the preaching of the gospel  whereof i paul am made a minister who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of christ in my flesh for his bodys sake which is the church  col chapter i ver     if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men the most miserable   cor chapter xv ver     why stand we in jeopardy every hour i protest by your rejoicing which i have in christ jesus i die daily if after the manner of men i have fought with beasts at ephesus what advantageth it me if the dead rise not   cor chapter xv ver  0 etc  if children then heirs heirs of god and jointheirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us romans chapter viii ver        who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter romans chap viii ver        rejoicing in hope patient in tribulation continuing instant in prayer romans chap xii ver     now concerning virgins i have no commandment of the lord yet i give my judgment as one that has obtained mercy of the lord to be faithful i suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress i say that it is good for a man so to be   cor chapter vii ver        for unto you it is given in the behalf of christ not only to believe in him but also to suffer for his sake having the same conflict which ye saw in me and now hear to be in me phil chapter i ver     0  god forbid that i should glory save in the cross of our lord jesus christ by whom the world is crucified unto me and i unto the world  from henceforth let no man trouble me for i bear in my body the marks of the lord jesus gal chapter vi ver        ye became followers of us and of the lord having received the word in much affliction with joy of the holy ghost   thessalonians chap i ver    we ourselves glory in you in the churches of god for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure   these chapter i ver    we may seem to have accumulated texts unnecessarily but beside that the point which they are brought to prove is of great importance there is this also to be remarked in every one of the passages cited that the allusion is drawn from the writer by the argument or the occasion that the notice which is taken of his sufferings and of the suffering condition of christianity is perfectly incidental and is dictated by no design of stating the facts themselves indeed they are not stated at all they may rather be said to be assumed this is a distinction upon which we have relied a good deal in former parts of this treatise and where the writers information cannot be doubted it always in my opinion adds greatly to the value and credit of the testimony  if any reader require from the apostle more direct and explicit assertions of the same thing he will receive full satisfaction in the following quotations  are they ministers of christ i speak as a fool i am more in labors more abundant in stripes above measure in prisons more frequent in deaths often of the jews five times received i forty stripes save one thrice was i beaten with rods once was i stoned thrice i suffered shipwreck a night and a day i have been in the deep in journeyings often in perils of waters in perils of robbers in perils by mine own countrymen in perils by the heathen in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea in perils among false brethren in weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst in fastings often in cold and nakedness   cor chap xi ver       can it be necessary to add more i think that god has set forth us the apostles last as it were appointed to death for we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men  even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain dewlling place and labor working with our own hands being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it being defamed we entreat we are made as the filth of the earth and are the offscouring of all things unto this day   cor chap iv ver     i subjoin this passage to the former because it extends to the other apostles of christianity much of that which st paul declared concerning himself  in the following quotations the reference to the authors sufferings is accompanied with a specification of time and place and with an appeal for the truth of what he declares to the knowledge of the persons whom he addresses even after that we had suffered before and were shamefully entreated as ye know at philippi we were bold in our god to speak unto you the gospel of god with much contention   thessalonians chap ii ver    but thou have fully known my doctrine manner of life purpose faith longsuffering persecutions afflictions which came to me at antioch at iconium at lystra what persecutions i endured but out of them all the lord delivered me   timothy chap iii ver  0     i apprehend that to this point as far as the testimony of st paul is credited the evidence from his letters is complete and full it appears under every form in which it could appear by occasional allusions and by direct assertions by general declarations and by specific examples  vii st paul in these letters asserts in positive and unequivocal terms his performance of miracles strictly and properly so called  he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit and works miracles  among you does he it by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith gal chap iii ver    for i will not dare to speak of those things which christ has not wrought by me i e i will speak of nothing but what christ has wrought by me or as grotius interprets it christ has wrought so great things by me that i will not dare to say what he has not wrought  to make the gentiles obedient by word and deed through mighty signs and wonders  by the power of the spirit of god so that from jerusalem and round about unto illyricum i have fully preached the gospel of christ romans chap xv ver        truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience in signs and wonders and mighty deeds  to these may be added the following indirect allusions which though if they had stood alone i e without plainer texts in the same writings they might have been accounted dubious yet when considered in conjunction with the passages already cited can hardly receive any other interpretation than that which we give them  my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of mens wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of man but of the power of god   cor chap ii ver      the gospel whereof i was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power ephesians chapter iii ver    for he that wrought effectually in peter to the apostleship of the circumcision the same was mighty in me toward the gentiles gal chapter ii ver    for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the holy ghost and in much assurance   thessalonians chap i ver        cor chap xii ver     these words signs wonders and mighty deeds  are the specific appropriate terms throughout the new testament employed when public sensible miracles are intended to be expressed this will appear by consulting amongst other places the texts referred to in the note mark xvi  0 luke xxiii   john ii       iii   iv       xi    acts ii    iv  0 v    vi   vii    xiv   xv    heb ii    and it cannot be shown that they are ever employed to express any thing else  secondly these words not only denote miracles as opposed to natural effects but they denote visible and what may be called external miracles as distinguished  first from inspiration if st paul had meant to refer only to secret illuminations of his understanding or secret influences upon his will or affections he could not with truth have represented them as signs and wonders wrought by him of signs and wonders and mighty deeds wrought amongst them  secondly from visions these would not by any means satisfy the force of the terms signs wonders and mighty deeds still less could they be said to be  wrought by him or wrought amongst them nor are these terms and expressions any where applied to visions when our author alludes to the supernatural communications which he had received either by vision or otherwise he uses expressions suited to the nature of the subject but very different from the words which we have quoted he calls them revelations but never signs wonders or mighty deeds i will come says he to visions and revelations of the lord and then proceeds to describe a particular instance and afterward adds lest i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given me a thorn in the flesh  upon the whole the matter admits of no softening qualification or ambiguity whatever if st paul did not work actual sensible public miracles he has knowingly in these letters born his testimony to a falsehood i need not add that in two also of the quotations he has advanced his assertion in the face of those persons amongst whom he declares the miracles to have been wrought  let it be remembered that the acts of the apostles describe various particular miracles wrought by st paul which in their nature answer to the terms and expressions which we have seen to be used by st paul himself  here then we have a man of liberal seize and in other points of sound judgment who had addicted his life to the service of the gospel we see him in the prosecution of his purpose traveling from country to country enduring every species of hardship encountering every extremity of danger assaulted by the populace punished by the magistrates scourged beat stoned left for dead expecting whenever he came a renewal of the same treatment and the same dangers yet when driven from one city preaching in the next spending his whole time in the employment sacrificing to it his pleasures his ease his safety persisting in this course to old age unaltered by the experience of perverseness ingratitude prejudice desertion unsubdued by anxiety want labor persecutions unwearied by long confinement undismayed by the prospect of death such was st paul we have his letters in our hands we have also a history purporting to be written by one of his fellowtravellers and appearing by a comparison with these letters certainly to have been written by some person well acquainted with the transactions of his life from the letters as well as from the history we gather not only the account which we have stated of him but that he was one out of many who acted and suffered in the same manner and that of those who did so several had been the companions of christs ministry the ocular witnesses or pretending to be such of his miracles and of his resurrection we moreover find this same person referring in his letters to his supernatural conversion the particulars and accompanying circumstances of which are related in the history and which accompanying circumstances if all or any of them be true render it impossible to have been a delusion we also find him positively and in appropriated terms asserting that he himself worked miracles strictly and properly so called in support of the mission which he executed the history meanwhile recording various passages of his ministry which come up to the extent of this assertion the question is whether falsehood was ever attested by evidence like this falsehoods we know have found their way into reports into tradition into books but is an example to be met with of a man voluntarily undertaking a life of want and pain of incessant fatigue of continual peril submitting to the loss of his home and country to stripes and stoning to tedious imprisonment and the constant expectation of a violent death for the sake of carrying about a story of what was false and of what if false he must have known
