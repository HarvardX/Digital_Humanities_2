emperors library keeper  faithfully transcribed out of captain lemuel gullivers general description of the empire of lilliput mentioned in the   th page of the first volume of his travels  london printed for j roberts in warwick lane mdccxxviii  an account of the state of learning in the empire of lilliput as i always had a strong inclination to reading from the time i first went to emanuelcollege in cambridge and had gone through the most valuable ancient writers during my stay in lilliput i was very inquisitive about the state of learning in that nation and received the following information upon that subject  in former ages the government of the island blefuscu was in many respects like what we call a commonwealth and for a long time flourished both in arms and learning whilst the lilliputians were a barbarous people at this time many excellent books were wrote in oratory poetry history and philosophy but the blefuscudians having at length lost their liberties and form of government which was changed into an empire learning decayed amongst them very fast the faster by reason of hot disputes which arose concerning the proper manner of dressing and eating eggs and in these the whole studies of all the learned men of that age were consumed  the first emperor of blefuscu that he might ingratiate himself with his people whom he had enslaved undertook an expedition against the island of lilliput which being then governed by several petty kings ignorant of the arts of war was by degrees subdued to the empire of blefuscu during this intercourse between the two nations the blefuscudian language was very much changed by the mixture of the lilliputian and those authors who wrote in the old language were neglected and understood by very few  in process of time the lilliputians grew weary of subjection flung off the foreign yoke set up an emperor of their own with great success and ever since have been a distinct empire from that of blefuscu  as they were an ingenious people and blessed with a race of good emperors they soon excelled their neighbors in learning and arms they got together all the old blefuscudian books their emperor founded a gomflastru or seminary with different schools to instruct their youth in the old blefuscudian language and learning and from thence chose their nardacs glumglums and hurgos and the emperors had themselves a large collection of these books in a library belonging to the palace  thus the lilliputians flourished in politeness and literature for some ages till at length by the plenty of a long peace they also grew corrupt gave themselves up to idleness luxury and intriguing and fell into controversies about breaking their eggs the old blefuscudian books were laid aside and nothing regarded but eggs and politics the gomflastru indeed continued each school had its mulro or governor and scholars but the taste of the age being changed they only turned over the old authors to amuse themselves and enjoyed the moderate revenues bequeathed to them by former emperors the present emperor indeed had endeavored to bring them into esteem again he increased their possessions and gave a noble present of books to the gomflastru but having a debauched inconstant people to rule over and being kept in continual alarms of wars by his neighbors he had not leisure to perfect his good intentions  i was at this time in his favor and when he heard that i had been inquisitive about these affairs he very graciously desired me to look into his library and sent orders to the keeper of it to use me with great respect and to present me with five hundred books such as i should choose  accordingly upon a day appointed i went to the library which i took a view of in the same manner as i had done of the rest of the palace by lying down and looking in at the window the building was ruinous the inside dusty the books many in number but scattered about in great disorder the library keeper whose name is bullum was alone stalking amidst the rubbish as soon as he saw my face at the window he made his best bow and began his speech to me which as i was afterward informed he had taken a great deal of pains about knowing me to be in the emperors good graces most part of what he spoke was unintelligible to me by a ridiculous mixture of the old blefuscudian language and what i did understand was fulsome flattery and complements that nothing mortal could deserve  this was very dull entertainment to a man of my modesty and thereupon finding his speech would be long and that he was forced to strain his voice to make me hear at that distance i thought it would be a kindness to us both to put a stop to him which i did returning him thanks in few words for his great opinion of me and desired to see him the next day that i might choose out the five hundred books which the emperor had given me  bullum as i heard afterward was in great wrath and loaded me with many opprobrious names for refusing to hear his speech out and daring to treat a man of his learning with so little respect however he stifled his resentment a little for the present and came to me at the time appointed  i desired him to show me a catalogue of the books and to give me some account of what they treated of that i might be able to make a choice he replied that he had not troubled himself to bring a written catalogue but that he had one in his memory and immediately he repeated to me the titles of a vast number of old blefuscudian books and run on with a great fluency of speech till he was out of breath  it was a pain to me to forbear laughing to hear bullum sputter out so much jargon at last i told him that i was not in the least wiser for what he had said because i understood not a syllable of the language he spoke at that as he stood on the table before me he put out his underlip and staring me full in the face said with a great deal of contempt not understand blefuscudian what do you understand  i was a little discomposed at this treatment but not knowing then what interest he had at court i resolved to use him civilly and replied that i understood eight or nine languages if there was any merit in that but that none of the books in his library would be of any use to me that were not written in lilliputian lilliputian says he i cannot repeat the titles of many of them but i will send you five hundred in a few days and thus he left me  i was very impatient to receive this curious present but bullum broke his word for about this time my interest at court began to decline i could not prevail upon him to deliver the books to me at last after much importunity he came to me himself attended by a servant with only five books  i was surprised at this and asked if the rest were upon the road he answered that since he had seen me last he had spent some days in carefully perusing the emperors orders that he had discovered the word hundred to be an interpolation and that the true reading was five books which in obedience to the emperor he had brought me  i had indeed been put off so long that i suspected i should have had none and therefore agreed to have the five books designing to have made my complaint afterward but bullum had another trick to play me it was the custom he said for all strangers to make him a complement in writing which he desired me to comply with and then he would deliver the books to me he had brought the form which i was to transcribe and sign with my own name the words were these  be it known to all men that bullum the great library keeper to the emperor of lilliput and mulro in the gomflastru is a man of vast erudition and learning all parts of the world ring with his praises and whilst i was honored with his acquaintance he used me with singular humanity  quinbus flestrin  out of an earnest desire to get possession of the books i submitted even to this demand of bullum who then ordering them to be flung down before me turned nimbly upon his heel and left me he had picked out for me the five worst books in the library according to his judgment but when i came to peruse them with a microscope the biggest being a folio about half an inch long i found they were very curious in their kind but treating of subjects that bullum was not conversant in there was    a collection of poetry   an essay on humility necessary for all lilliputians who are very much inclined to think well of themselves and meanly of others   a dissertation upon tramecsans and slamecsans or highheeld and lowheeld shoes   a bundle of controversies concerning the primitive way of breaking eggs   the blundecral or al these books i brought safe with me to england and design either to publish them or else to present them to the university which i had once the honor to be a member of  but to return to bullum i was amazed at his behavior toward me especially considering i was a nardac to which title he generally paid a profound respect this made  desirous of getting an account of his history and character which having something extraordinary in them i shall lay before my reader  bullum is a tall rawbond man i believe near six inches and an half high from his infancy he applied himself with great industry to the old blefuscudian language in which he made such a progress that he almost forgot his native lilliputian and at this time he can neither write nor speak two sentences without a mixture of old blefuscudian these qualifications joined to an undaunted forward spirit and a few good friends prevailed with the emperors grandfather to make him keeper of his library and a mulro in the gomflastru though most men thought him fitter to be one of the royal guards these places soon helped him to riches and upon the strength of them he soon began to despise every body and to be despised by every body this engaged him in many quarrels which he managed in a very odd manner whenever he thought himself affronted he immediately flung a great book at his adversary and if he could felled him to the earth but if his adversary stood his ground and flung another book at him which was sometimes done with great violence then he complained to the grand justiciary that these affronts were designed to the emperor and that he was singled out only as being the emperors servant by this trick he got that great officer to favor him which made his enemies cautious and him insolent  bullum attended the court some years but could not get into an higher post for though he constantly wore the heels of his shoes high or low as the fashion was yet having a long back and a stiff neck he never could with any dexterity creep under the stick which the emperor or the chief minister held as to his dancing on the rope i shall speak of it presently but the greatest skill at that art will not procure a man a place at court without some agility at the stick  bullum vexed at these disappointments withdrew from court and only appeared there upon extraordinary occasions at other times he retired to his post of mulro in the gomflatu there he led a gloomy solitary life heaped up wealth and pored upon the old blefuscudian books it might have been expected that from so long an acquaintance with those admirable writers he should have grown more polite and humane but his manner was never to regard the sense or subject of the author but only the shape of the letters in which he arrived to such perfection that as i have been assured he could tell very near in what year of the blefuscudian commonwealth any book was written and to this and to restoring the old characters that were effaced all his labor was confined  upon these points he had wrote several books some in the blefuscudian and some in the mixed language and whenever he had finished a book he presented it to some great man at court with a panegyrical oration so contrived that it would fit any man in a great post and the highest bidder had it  whilst i was in lilliput he proposed to publish a new blundecral of alcoran and that he might do something uncommon he began at the end and designed to have wrote backwards but the lilliputians some liking the old blundecral others not caring for any gave him no encouragement and therefore he desisted from that project  as this nation was very much divided about breaking their eggs which they generally eat in public once a day or at least once in seven days i desired to know how bullum behaved himself in this particular and was told that he was thought to have an aversion to eggs for he was never seen to eat any in public but once or twice in a year when his post obliged him to it at those times he gave orders to have them served up to him ready dressed and the shells and whites being carefully taken off he gulped up the yolks in a very indecent manner and immediately drank a bumper of strong liquor after them to wash the taste out of his mouth and promote the digestion of them  when any one represented to him the ill example of this practice his answer was that his modesty would not let him devour eggs in public when he had so many eyes upon him that he was not yet determined at which end he ought to break them that the shells and whites were insipid and only fit for children but for the eggs themselves he was so far from hating them that he had a dish at his own table every day but whether this was truth or if they were at his table whether he eat of them or not i could never learn  bullum was always of an haughty mind and in his own school took a great deal of pleasure in mimicking the actions of the emperor thus he got a little stick and used to divert himself in seeing his scholars leap over and creep under it as he held it between his hands those who performed best were rewarded sometimes with a pompous title in the old blefuscudian language signifying most learned most famous most accomplished youth or the like sometimes with little sugarplums and sometimes only with the promise of them  in dancing on the ropes he took great delight himself and this was the only bodily exercise he used those who had been eyewitnesses informed me that he could cut a caper very high but that he did it in a clumsy manner and with little delight to the spectators who were in continual apprehensions of his falling which sometimes he did very dangerously  it was observed that he danced best in his own house but that he never danced before the gomflastru with success when he first came to his place of mulro he did nothing but dance and cut capers on the ropes for a year together as this was a new sport in that part of the island he got a great deal of money by it but striving to leap higher than ordinary he fell off from the rope broke his head and disordered his brain so much that most people thought it would incapacitate him for his post of mulro however at length he pretty well recovered he himself says he is as well or better than he was before his fall but his enemies think his brain is still affected by it  some years after the present emperor in a progress through his dominions came to the gomflastru and bullum without being asked was resolved to divert his majesty with his performance on the straitrope up he mounts and capers bravely for some time at last endeavoring to show the utmost of his skill in the midst of an high caper he reached out his right hand too far which gave him a terrible fall  most people imputed it to his overreaching himself but he laid the fault partly upon the robes he was obliged to wear before the emperor which as he said entangled his feet and partly upon the maliciousness of a byestander whom he accused of pulling the rope aside as he was in the midst of his caper however that was poor bullum broke his leg and was carried to his own house where he continued lame above two years not being able to show himself in public all that time and it was thought he would never have recovered if the emperor at last had not taken pity on him and sent one of his own surgeons to him who cured him immediately  after all these misfortunes bullum could not forsake his beloved diversion but as soon as he was recovered he forgot all that was past and danced again in his own school every day where by his frequent falls he so bruised himself that it was believed they would come to a mortification besides he dances so long upon the same rope that through age and rottenness and his great weight it must break at last and the emperor would scarce lend him a surgeon a second time which indeed would be in vain for he can never leave off the sport though he performs worse and worse every day so that in all probability he will break his neck for a conclusion  finis
