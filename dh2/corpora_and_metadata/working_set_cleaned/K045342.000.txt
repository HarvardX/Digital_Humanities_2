substance of the speech of the right honorable edmund burke in thr debate on the army estimates in the house of commons on tuesday the  th day of february    0 comprehending a discussion of the present situation of affairs in france  london printed for j debrett opposite burlington house piccadilly mdccxc  substance of the speech of the right honorable edmund burke mr burkes speech on the report of the army has not been correctly stated in some of the public papers it is of consequence to him not to be misunderstood the matter which incidentally came into discussion is of the most serious importance it is thought that the heads and substance of the speech will answer the purpose sufficiently if in making the abstract through defect of memory in the person who now gives it any difference at all should be perceived from the speech as it was spoken it will not the editor imagines be found in any thing which may amount to a retraction of the opinions he then maintained or to any softening in the expressions in which they were conveyed  mr burke spoke a considerable time in answer to various arguments which had been insisted upon by mr grenville and mr pit for keeping an increased peace establishment and against an improper jealousy of the ministers in whom a full confidence subject to responsibility ought to be placed on account of their knowledge of the real situation of affairs the exact state of which it frequently happened that they could not disclose without violating the constitutional and political secrecy necessary to the well being of their country  mr burke said in substance that confidence might become a vice and jealousy a virtue according to circumstances that confidence of all public virtues was the most dangerous and jealousy in an house of commons of all public vices the most tolerable especially where the number and the charge of standing armies in time of peace was the question  that in the annual mutiny bill the annual army was declaredly to be for the purpose of preserving the balance of power in europe the propriety of its being larger or smaller depended therefore upon the true state of that balance if the increase of peace establishments demanded of parliament agreed with the manifest appearance of the balance confidence in ministers as to the particulars would be very proper if the increase was not at all supported by any such appearance he thought great jealousy might and ought to be entertained on that subject  that he did not find on a review of all europe that politically we stood in the smallest degree of danger from any one state or kingdom it contained nor that any other foreign powers than our own allies were likely to obtain a considerable preponderance in the scale  that france had hitherto been our first object in all considerations concerning the balance of power the presence or absence of france totally varied every sort of speculation relative to that balance  that france was at this time in a political light to be considered as expunged out of the system of europe whether she ever could appear in it again as a leading power was not easy to determine but at present he considered france as not politically existing and most assuredly it would take up much time to restore her to her former active existence  gallos quoque in bellis floruisse audivimus might possibly be the language of the rising generation he did not mean to deny that it was our duty to keep our eye on that nation and to regulate our preparation by the symptoms of her recovery  that it was to her strength not to her form of government which we were to attend because republics as well as monarchies were susceptible of ambition jealousy and anger the usual causes of war  but if while france continued in this swoon we should go on increasing our expenses we should certainly make ourselves less a match for her when it became our concern to arm  it was said that as she had speedily fallen she might speedily rise again he doubted this that the fall from an height was with an accelerated velocity but to lift a weight up to that height again was difficult and opposed by the laws of physical and political gravitation  in a political view france was low indeed she had lost every thing even to her name jacet ingens littere truncus avolsumque humeris caput et sine nomine corpus mr burke probably had in his mind the remainder of the passage and was filled with some congenial apprehensions haec finis priami fatorum hic exitus illum sort tulit trojam incensam and prolapsa videntem pergama tot quondam populis terrisque superbum regnatorem asiae jacet ingens littore truncus avolsumque humeris caput and sine nomine corpus at me tum primum soevus circumstetit horror obstupui subiit chari genitoris imago      he was astonished at it  he was alarmed at it  he trembled at the uncertainty of all human greatness  since the house had been prorogued in the summer much work was done in france the french had shown themselves the ablest architects of ruin that had hitherto existed in the world in that very short space of time they had completely pulled down to the ground their monarchy their church their nobility their law their revenue their army their navy their commerce their arts and their manufactures they had done their business for us as rivals in a way in which twenty ramilies or blenheims could never have done it were we absolute conquerors and france to lie prostrate at our feet we should be ashamed to send a commission to settle their affairs which could impose so hard a law upon the french and so destructive of all their consequence as a nation as that they had imposed upon themselves  france by the mere circumstance of its vicinity had been and in a degree always must be an object of our vigilance either with regard to her actual power or to her influence and example as to the former he had spoken as to the latter her example he should say a few words for by this example our friendship and our intercourse with that nation had once been and might again become more dangerous to us than their worst hostility  in the last century louis the fourteenth had established a greater and better disciplined military force than ever had been before seen in europe and with it a perfect despotism though that despotism was proudly arrayed in manners gallantry splendour magnificence and even covered over with the imposing robes of science literature and arts it was in government nothing better than a painted and gilded tyranny in religion an hard stern intolerance the sit companion and auxiliary to the despotic tyranny which prevailed in its government the same character of despotism insinuated itself into every court of europe  the same spirit of disproportioned magnificence  the same love of standing armies above the ability of the people in particular our then sovereigns king charles and king james fell in love with the government of their neighbor so flattering to the pride of kings a similarity of sentiments brought on connections equally dangerous to the interests and liberties of their country it were well that the infection had gone no farther than the throne the admiration of a government flourishing and successful unchecked in its operations and seeming therefore to compass its objects more speedily and effectually gained something upon all ranks of people the good patriots of that day however struggled against it they sought nothing more anxiously than to break off all communication with france and to beget a total alienation from its councils and its example which by the animosity prevalent between the abettors of their religious system and the assertors of ours was in some degree effected  this day the evil is totally changed in france but there is an evil the disease is altered but the vicinity of the two countries remains and must remain and the natural mental habits of mankind are such that the present distemper of france it is far more likely to be contagious than the old one for it is not quite easy to spread a passion for servitude among the people but in all evils of the opposite kind our natural inclinations are flattered in the case of despotism there is the foedum crimen servitutis in the last the falsa species libertatis and accordingly as the historian says pronis auribus accipitur  in the last age we were in danger of being entangled by the example of france in the net of a relentless despotism it is not necessary to say any thing upon that example it exists no longer our present danger from the example of a people whose character knows no medium is with regard to government a danger from anarchy a danger of being led through an admiration of successful fraud and violence to an imitation of the excesses of an irrational unprincipled proscribing confiscating plundering ferocious bloody and tyrannical democracy on the side of religion the danger of their example is no longer from intolerance but from atheism a foul unnatural vice foe to all the dignity and consolation of mankind which seems in france for a long time to have been embodie into a faction accredited and almost avowed  these are our present dangers from france but in his opinion the very worst part of the example set is in the late assumption of citizenship by the army and the whole of the arrangement or rather disarrangement of their military  he was sorry that his right honorable friend mr fox had dropped even a word expressive of exultation on that circumstance or that he seemed of opinion that the objection from standing armies was at all lessened by it he attributed this opinion of mr fox entirely to his known zeal for the best of all causes liberty that it was with a pain inexpressible he was obliged to have even the shadow of a difference with his friend whose authority would be always great with him and with all thinking people  quae maxima semper censetur nobis et erit quae maxima semper  his confidence in mr fox was such and so ample as to be almost implicit that he was not ashamed to avow that degree of docility that when the choice is well made it strengthens instead of oppressing our intellect that he who calls in the aid of an equal understanding doubles his own he who profits of a superior understanding raises his powers to a level with the height of the superior understanding he unites with he had found the benefit of such a junction and would not lightly depart from it he wished almost on all occasions that his sentiments were understood to be conveyed in mr foxs words and that he wished as amongst the greatest benefits he could wish the country an eminent share of power to that right honorable gentleman because he knew that to his great and masterly understanding he had joined the greatest possible degree of that natural moderation which is the best corrective of power that he was of the most artless candid open and benevolent disposition disinterested in the extreme of a temper mild and placable even to a fault without one drop of gall in his whole constitution  that the house must perceive from his coming forward to mark an expression or two of his best friend how anxious he was to keep the distemper of france from the least countenance in england where he was sure some wicked persons had shown a strong disposition to recommend an imitation of the french spirit of reform he was so strongly opposed to any the least tendency toward the means of introducing a democracy like theirs as well as to the end itself that much as it would afflict him if such a thing could be attempted and that any friend of his could concur in such measures he was far very far from believing they could he would abandon his best friends and join with his worst enemies to oppose either the means or the end and to resist all violent exertions of the spirit of innovation so distant from all principles of true and safe reformation a spirit well calculated to overturn states but perfectly unfit to amend them  that he was no enemy to reformation almost every business in which he was much concerned from the first day he sat in that house to that hour was a business of reformation and when he had not been employed in correcting he had been employed in resisting abuses some traces of this spirit in him now stand on their statute book in his opinion any thing which unnecessarily tore to pieces the contexture of the state not only prevented all real reformation but introduced evils which would call but perhaps call in vain for new reformation  that he thought the french nation very unwise what they valued themselves on was a disgrace to them they had gloried and some people in england had thought fit to take share in that glory in making a revolution as if revolutions were good things in themselves all the horrors and all the crimes of the anarchy which led to their revolution which attend its progress and which may virtually attend it in its establishment pass for nothing with the lovers of revolutions the french have made their way through the destruction of their country to a bad constitution when they were absolutely in possession of a good one they were in possession of it the day the states met in separate orders their business had they been either virtuous or wise or had been left to their own judgment was to secure the stability and independence of the states according to those orders under the monarch on the throne it was then their duty to redress grievances  instead of redressing grievances and improving the fabric of their state to which they were called by their monarch and sent by their country they were made to take a very different course they first destroyed all the balances and counterpoises which serve to fix the state and to give it a steady direction and which furnish sure correctives to any violent spirit which may prevail in any of the orders these balances existed in their oldest constitution and in the constitution of this country and in the constitution of all the countries in europe these they rashly destroyed and then they melted down the whole into one incongruous illconnected mass  when they had done this they instantly with the most atrocious perfidy and breach of all faith among men laid the axe to the root of all property and consequently of all national prosperity by confiscating all the possessions of the church they made and recorded a sort of institute and digest of anarchy called the rights of man in such a pedantic abuse of elementary principles as would have disgraced boys at school but this declaration of rights was worse than trifling and pedantic in them as by their name and authority they systematically destroyed every hold of authority by opinion religious or civil on the minds of the people by this mad declaration they subverted the state and brought on such calamities as no country without a long war has ever been known to suffer and which may in the end produce such a war and perhaps many such  with them the question was not between despotism and liberty the sacrifice they made of the peace and power of their country was not made on the altar of freedom they brought themselves into all the calamities they suffer not that through them they might obtain the british constitution they plunged themselves headlong into those calamities to prevent themselves from settling into that constitution or into any thing resembling it  that if they should perfectly succeed in what they propose as they are likely enough to do and establish a democracy or a mob of democracies in a country circumstanced like france they will establish a very bad government  a very bad species of tyranny  that the worst effect of all their proceeding was on their military which was rendered an army for every purpose but that of defense that if the question was whether soldiers were to forget they were citizens as an abstract proposition he could have no difference about it though as it is usual when abstract principles are to be applied much was to be thought on the manner of uniting the character of citizen and soldier but as applied to the events which had happened in france where the abstract principle was clothed with its circumstances he thought that his friend would agree with him that what was done there furnished no matter of exultation either in the act or the example these soldiers were not citizens but base hireling mutineers and mercenary sordid deserters wholly destitute of any honorable principle their conduct was one of the fruits of that anarchic spirit from the evils of which a democracy itself was to be received by those who were the least disposed to that form as a cure it was not an army in corpse and with discipline and embodied under the respectable patriot citizens of the state in resisting tyranny nothing like it it was the case of common soldiers deserting from their officers to join a furious licentious populace it was a desertion to a cause the real object of which was to level all those institutions and to break all those connections natural and civil that regulate and hold together the community by a chain of subordination to raise soldiers against their officers servants against their masters tradesmen against their customers artificers against their employers tenants against their landlords curates against their bishops and children against their parents that this cause of theirs was not an enemy to servitude but to society  he wished the house to consider how the members would like to have their mansions pulled down and pillaged their persons abused insulted and destroyed their title deeds brought out and burned before their faces and themselves and their families driven to seek refuge in every nation throughout europe for no other reason than this that without any fault of theirs they were born gentlemen and men of property and were suspected of a desire to preserve their consideration and their estates the desertion in france was to aid an abominable sedition the very professed principle of which was an implacable hostility to nobility and gentry and whose savage warwhoop was a l aristocrate by which senseless bloody cry they animated one another to rapine and murder whilst abetted by ambitious men of another class they were crushing every thing respectable and virtuous in their nation and to their power disgracing almost every name by which we formerly knew there was such a country in the world as france  he knew too well and he felt as much as any man how difficult it was to accommodate a standing army to a free constitution or to any constitution an armed disciplined body is in its essence dangerous to liberty undisciplined it is ruinous to society its component parts are in the latter case neither good citizens nor good soldiers what have they thought of in france under such a difficulty as almost puts the human faculties to a stand they have put their army under such a variety of principles of duty that it is more likely to breed litigants pettyfoggers and mutineers than soldiers they have to balance their crown army another army deriving under another authority called a municipal army  a balance of armies not of orders these latter they have destroyed with every mark of insult and oppression states may and they will best exist with a partition of power armies cannot exist under a divided command this state of things he thought in effect a state of war or at best but a truce instead of peace in the country  what a dreadful thing is a standing army for the conduct of the whole or any part of which no man is responsible in the present state of the french crown army is there any general who can be responsible for the obedience of a brigade any colonel for that of a regiment any captain for that of a company and as to the municipal army reinforced as it is by the new citizendeserters under whose command are they have we not seen them not led by but dragging their nominal commander with a rope about his neck when they or those whom they accompanied proceeded to the most attrocious acts of treason and murder are any of these armies are any of these citizens  we have in such a difficulty as that of fitting a standing army to the state as he conceived done much better we have not distracted our army by divided principles of obedience we have put them under a single authority with a simple our common oath of fidelity and we keep the whole under our annual inspection this was doing all that could be safely done  he felt some concern that this strange thing called a revolution in france should be compared with the glorious event commonly called the revolution in england and the conduct of the soldiery on that occasion compared with the behavior of some of the troops of france in the present instance at that period the prince of orange a prince of the blood royal in england was called in by the flower of the english aristocracy to defend its ancient constitution and not to level all distinctions to this prince so invited the aristocratic leaders who commanded the troops went over with their several corpse in bodies to the deliverer of their country aristocratic leaders brought up the corpse of citizens who newly enlisted in this cause military obedience changed its object but military discipline was not for a moment interrupted in its principle the troops were ready for war but indisposed to mutiny  but as the conduct of these armies was different so was that of the whole english nation at that time in truth the circumstances of our revolution as it is called and that of france are just the reverse of each other in almost every particular and in the whole spirit of the transaction with us it was the case of a legal monarch attempting arbitrary power  in france it is the case of an arbitrary monarch beginning from whatever cause to legalise his authority the one was to be resisted the other was to be managed and directed but in neither case was the order of the state to be changed lest government might be ruined which ought only to be corrected and legalised with us we got rid of the man and preserved the constituent parts of the state there they get rid of the constituent parts of the state and keep the man what we did was in truth and substance and in a constitutional light a revolution not made but prevented we took solid securities we settled doubtful questions we corrected anomalies in our law in the stable fundamental parts of our constitution we made no revolution no nor any alteration at all we did not impair the monarchy perhaps it might be shown that we strengthened it very considerably the nation kept the same ranks the same orders the same privileges the same franchises the same rules for property the same subordinations the same order in the law in the revenue and in the magistracy the same lords the same commons the same corporations the same electors  the church was not impaired her estates her majesty her splendour her orders and gradations continued the same she was preserved in her full efficiency and cleared only of a certain intolerance which was her weakness and disgrace the church and the state were the same after the revolution that they were before but better secured in every part  was little done because a revolution was not made in the constitution no every thing was done because we commenced with reparation not with ruin accordingly the state flourished instead of lying as dead in a sort of trance or exposed as some others in an epileptic fit to the pity or derision of the world for her wild ridiculous convulsive movements impotent to every purpose but that of dashing out our brains against the pavement great britain rose above the standard even of her former self an era of a more improved domestic prosperity then commenced and still continues not only unimpaired but growing under the wasting hand of time all the energies of the country were awakened england never presented a firmer countenance or a more vigorous arm to all her enemies and to all her rivals europe under her respired and revived every where she appeared as the protector assertor or avenger of liberty a war was made and supported against fortune itself the treaty of ryswick which first limited the power of france was soon after made the grand alliance very shortly followed which shook to the foundations the dreadful power which menaced the independence of mankind the states of europe lay happy under the shade of a great and free monarchy which knew how to be great without endangering its own peace at home or the internal or external peace of any of its neighbors  mr burke said he should have felt very unpleasantly if he had not delivered these sentiments he was near the end of his natural probably still nearer to the end of his political career that he was weak and weary and wished for rest that he was little disposed to controversies or what is called a detailed opposition that at his time of life if he could not do something by some sort of weight of opinion natural or acquired it was useless and indecorous to attempt any thing by mere struggle turpe senex miles that he had for that reason little attended the army business or that of the revenue or almost any other matter of detail for some years past that he had however his task he was far from condemning such opposition on the contrary he most highly applauded it where a just occasion existed for it and gentlemen had vigor and capacity to pursue it where a great occasion occurred he was and while he continued in parliament would be amongst the most active and the most earnest as he hoped he had shown on a late event with respect to the constitution itself he wished few alterations in it happy if he left it not the worse for any share he had taken in its service  mr fox then rose and declared in substance that so far as regarded the french army he went no farther than the general principle by which that army showed itself indisposed to be an instrument in the servitude of their fellow citizens but did not enter into the particulars of their conduct he declared that he did not affect a democracy that he always thought any of the simple unbalanced governments bad simple monarchy simple aristocracy simple democracy he held them all imperfect or vicious all were bad by themselves the composition alone was good that these had been always his principles in which he had agreed with his friend mr burke of whom he said many kind and flattering things which mr burke i take it for granted will know himself too well to think he merits from any thing but mr foxs acknowledged good nature mr fox thought however that in many cases he was rather carried too far by his hatred to innovation  mr burke said he well knew that these had been mr foxs invariable opinions that they were a sure ground for the confidence of his country but he had been fearful that cabals of very different intentions would be ready to make use of his great name against his character and sentiments in order to derive a credit to their destructive machinations  mr sheridan then rose and made a lively and eloquent speech against mr burke in which among other things he said that mr burke had libelled the national assembly of france and had cast out reflections on such characters as those of the marquis de la fayette and mr bailly  mr burke said that he did not libel the national assembly of france whom he considered very little in the discussion of these matters that he thought all the substantial power resided in the republic of paris whose authority guided or whose example was followed by all the republics of france the republic of paris had an army under their orders and not under those of the national assembly  n b as to the particular gentlemen i do not remember that mr burke mentioned either of them  certainly not mr bailly he alluded undoubtedly to the case of the marquis de la fayette but whether what he asserted of him be a libel on him must be left to those who are acquainted with the business  mr pit concluded the debate with becoming gravity and dignity and a reserve on both sides of the question as related to france fit for a person in a ministerial situation he said that what he had spoken only regarded france when she should unite which he rather thought she soon might with the liberty she had acquired the blessings of law and order he too said several civil things concerning the sentiments of mr burke as applied to this country  finis
