reasons why david garrick esquire should not appear on the stage etc  price one shilling  reasons why david garrick esquire should not appear on the stage in a letter to john rich esquire  london printed for j cook at shakespeares head behind the chapter house st pauls churchyard mdcclix  a letter etc sir there are many undeniable and irrefragable arguments to support my negative but as vellum says out of several i shall only mention a few  i need not in this case beg a question which will readily be granted and therefore i shall take it for granted that all persons who go to the theater go there for entertainment in order to hear and see every thing and every body if i read mr palmers name in the bill of the way of the world for mirabel i go with a conviction that i shall see and hear him with entire satisfaction and so of mr king in the part of atall in the double gallant now in neither of these plays nor in many others does mr garrick intrude upon my entertainment nor obstruct my satisfaction because he does not play in them but when i go to see the suspicious husband there i see mr garrick in the part of ranger and sure no man will deny but that he plays that part better than any other man in the world but will any person be so hardy as to tell me i shall part with my money to see honest ranger only i want to see frankly and bellamy and rattling jack meggot i would willingly see mr strictland the character who gives title to the comedy yet am i herein debarred by mr garricks instrusion for when he appears on the stage i am so blinded either by prejudice or admiration that i can see no body else i can hear no body else i can bear no body else for instance the other day i wanted to hear jacky meggot invite ranger and his friend in the italian taste to his house but i never heard a syllable of it  when ranger is with his two friends bellamy and frankly i hear him indeed speak of them and i am as much surpized to find him speaking to them but i can never set my eyes on them while he is by before he came in i could see and hear them as distinctly and as clearly as visibly and audibly as ever i saw or heard any thing in all my life but when he comes in whether it is that he clouds my eyes or fills my sight i cannot for my soul determine but i see no more of bellamy and frankly if they are there i do not hear them and though i use my glass i cannot see them till he goes out again  i hear him say plain enough now it is dear boy and honest ranger and just now you would have cut my throat but i never heard that they said any such words but from his report i suspected my own hearing nor i would not believe my own eyes till i asked a gentleman who sat by me whether frankly or bellamy were on the stage and he said that he could not see any such persons  then said i who the devil is he speaking to  by my soul replied the gentleman i cannot tell for i see neither of them nor do i believe either of them to be on the stage if they are it is more than i can say and i am as uneasy as you can be to see one man play the whole comedy by himself it is really too hard upon him and i cannot find the reason why he keeps so many people in sallary to so little purpose and almost for doing nothing  i came here the other night when mr garrick did not play and i saw every body and heard every thing to my entire satisfaction but when this confounded garrick comes on the stage he confounds my eyes and ears in such a manner that i am deprived of both organs which are entirely engrossed by his appearance and voice  when my sidesman had done speaking i asked a lady who sat by me who mr garrick was speaking to she said she could not tell  when he says any letters or message does he speak to the scene for by the lord i see no servant she said she thought her eyes pretty good and that she was as blind as myself in that respect  and indeed she had the highest pair of eyes that ever my eyes beheld yet clear as her vision was she could see no servant nor any thing else but this individual garrick  he is not of so gigantic a stature nor do i think he ever will exceed six feet in height he is not so fat as sir john falstaff and how the devil does this manager manage to cover every body and every thing from our sight  he must deal in magic thus to interpose between the spectators and every body else in such a black art manner as render them invisible  he is the reverse of a darklanthorn which hides the bearer and throws light upon every body else he is like the focus of a glass which attracts all the rays of light he is like a sundial which interprets time by light and shade  himself all light every body else all shade  now a representation may be called a picture but no good picture was ever all light and all shade but both should be happily compounded and mixed to make a picture agreeable and striking  i like a fool the other night went to see the alchymist i saw burton and palmer plain enough till abel drugger came on fiddling with his shopkeepers apron he no sooner came on than away went subtle and captain face says i to one near me is not this monstrous that subtle and face should go off the stage at the time when nab wants them he answered that he thought it unaccountable and that he was served so once before the last season and that if he had recollected himself in that particular he would not have come to see abel drugger alone  you know the plot says he is mixed and has a variety of persons in the drama but the devil a one person here but abel drugger  you shall see him fight a parcel of shadows and beat them off presently he is excellent at skiomachy he did so in a very short time beating the air with as much dexterity as if there had been a dozen people on the stage well said i to the gentleman near me i dont like this egotism for as young the satyrist expresses it and is the little hero of each tale  another cogent reason i shall offer to the public and you sir why mr gartick should not appear on the stage is that besides blindfolding people by his fascination he imposes upon our hearing rendering us deaf to every other person but himself  this is an intolerable monopily thus to seize upon and captivate our two senses  i have spoken to that of sight already and now i shall enter upon that of hearing  we have had occular proofs sufficient to convince all reasonable people that is all people that will believe their eyes that mr garrick should not appear upon the stage had he happened to be an actor in paris he would long since have been put into the bastile but as he lives under so mild a government as that of great britain the best we can do is to put him under the punishment of proscription or in other words to banish him the stage the scene of his delinquency nor is it indeed reasonable in the nature of things to permit him to reign any longer in so unlimited a tyranny a tyranny for which some men would long since have been brought to the scaffold  i most wonder why his own company have not entered into a formal prosecution against him and brought their habeas corpus for rendering them invisible and inaudible they permit their names to be printed which is a kind of bond or promissary note payable to the public that they will enact such and such characters now if mr austin or mr burton or any of the players engages thus in print to perform this or that part and does not appear when garrick comes on have not i my writ of insolvency against him what can they plead why i should not oblige them to appear when mr garrick comes on  why do they go off that instant  there is no body in the galleries find any fault with them they and every other actor or actress in drury lane have their peculiar merits in their own particular cast each has his proper walk and shines in his own department and the next time i see them disappear on garricks entering i shall say with the witches in macbeth appear appear so i give them this fair warning  when mr garrick says in hamlet  i am too much in the sun he speaks an evident truth and if i may be allowed the expression a palpable one it is downright demonstration  he is too much in the sun what he says needs no illustration for he is so much in the sun that he takes all the light to himself and like a ray of glory or an infula of beams eclipses all others  the moon herself and most of the stars who borrow their light from the sun have not so much reason to complain if they have not light of their own they shine in borrowed robes but they would take it very ill of dan phoebus that wandering knight so fair if he should like garrick get up of a frosty night put on his damask nightgown and then put them all out  it would be as cruel in the sun to do so as it is in othello when he puts out the light and then puts out the light and i think with deference to the judgment of the public that it is as insufferable in mr garrick to extinguish all other lights but his own and i hope they will take proper cognizance and jointly agree to put him out by the concurring votes of ostracism  i will only ask the company of drurylanehouse has the manager as pythagoras did of old to his disciples enjoin them silence for any term of years if he has done this in his wisdom it is but reasonable he should set them an example  he should like a good father enforce by his precedent what he preaches in doctrine and not like an incendiary set us all by the ears and like the sentence of perjury impose the pillory upon his audience i must own that i am so great a lover of music that i could sit a whole hour to hear a good solo performed by a good hand but by the blood of the mirables i do not see why mr garrick should every night for these many seasons play nothing but solos this is rehearsal upon rehearsal and repetition upon the back of repetition are we never to have a concert because truly mr garrick loves nothing but solos i think mr holland and mr howard and mr bransby and indeed every mr and mrs in the house have a just title to perform their particular parts in the theatrical concert  they are paid for doing so we the public pay them and we insist on their playing for the future or we will pay them and repay them  had we found fault with their performance at any one time had we condemned their theatrical merit whether natural or acquired if we had refused to give them what is their undoubted right our just applause they might offer some plea for not discharging their duty but as matters stand we think this time as seasonable as well as unseasonable silence is insensible and we hope to see a reformation in due time which yet we think cannot well be made except mr garrick begins it by a solemn departure from the stage since we may apply horaces saying to him lusisti satis  tempus abire tibi   we shall now state some matters of fact in order to support our arguments  one matter of fact is that when he played hamlet no body else appeared when he was on our attention was so much engrossed by hamlet that we took no notice of any other person i neither saw bernardo nor marcellus nor heard one syllable of either rosenerans or guilderstern while hamlet was on  when hamlet says  the plays the thing with which i will catch the conscience of the thing we expected there would have been a play but if there was any such thing i did not see it or hear it it might have been played for any thing i know but certain it is it escaped me possibly i was gazing too attentively on hamlet sitting at the feet of ophelia and looking at something through her fan  i knew that the object of his intuition was to have been the king but the devil a king was there or if there was it was a king of hamlets own making like that when he says a king of shreds and patchesas in like manner in the alchymist is it fitting that abel dugger should play the whole play himself and let no one else be seen or heard while he is on if monopoly in trade be an injury to the public then it must be confessed with respect to our entertainments a theatrical monopoly is an unfair monopoly an embargo on our taste a kind of an inquisition a very star chamber on our understanding and if trade in general suffers by such monopolies so is taste in general utterly depraved by such unjust engrossment  why should not the witches be seen or heard when macbeth comes in when he says ye black confederate midnight hags what are ye doing instead of answering him a deed etc as they should do they instantly disappear they vanish and are no more seen he bewitches the very witches rendering them and all their diabolical proceedings invisible  the cauldron is no more he extinguishes their infernal flames and plays hell with hell itself sending the very devil as the sentence does the condemned criminal to the place from whence he came  and is this sufferable will any man be so hardy as to say this is to be borne  it is not to be borne  i think the witches have as great a right to answer as macbeth to ask a question at least i think it is so in your house sir and what is sauce for the goose should be sause for the gander as the saying is now at your house there are no such proceedings no such indecorum he does not swallow up the witches and devour them at a mouthful he does not like the famous fireeater feed upon brimstone and other combustibles which reminds me of a story i have somewhere read applicable to mr garricks thus eating up the devil without a grain of salt i say applicable to him for one very good reason and that is if i do not insert it here i shall forget to insert it any where else  a certain nobleman to divert himself carried a young blackamoor just imported to one of the papish chapels in the city and when the priest was eating the wafer the blackamoor asked his master what that man was eating who answered that he was eating his god  i wish we had him in our country says the blackamoor for he would eat the devil purely  this story needs no comment and therefore we shall make none we hope therefore from what we have advanced that these irrefragable arguments will have some weight with mr garrick and you are at liberty to show this letter to him if he is able to answer all or any one of them to our satisfaction we shall subscribe a submissive acknowledgment of our fault in the daily advertiser with the hopes of forgiveness and promise that we shall never be again guilty in this particular if not we shall say as the king in the mourning bride expresses it take away his facefor we must acknowledge that it dazzles our sight in such a manner that we can see nothing else nor indeed is any thing herein written sir in the least to insinuate any thing to the prejudice of your house which we honor and respect as we should do and we should want taste did we say any other your performers have merit enough to extort praise from the best judges or the nicest critics and perhaps one of the best low comedians in the world is in covent garden  neither is any thing herein written intended to depreciate or run down the actors of drury lane but the reverse is the intention of this letter for if we were hardy enough to say that all and every of them has not theatrical merit in an eminent degree it were to give our own judgments the lie and the falsehood like dust thrown in the wind would fly in our faces  it were a shallow artifice because we run down this most unreasonable man thereby to traduce or lessen that good esteem which they have learned by their good quallities or because they are not seen or heard when mr garrick appears that therefore they are not fit to be seen or that they should not be  the reverse of all this is meant and intended by the whole tenor of which however tortured to confess will never be made to confess what it never intended i say it is fitting they should be seen or heard and that in order thereto we have given this our safe advice to david garrick esquire manager of drury lane playhouse that he will appear no more on the stage which advice we should not have given in so peremptory a manner if he did not eclipse those who play with him our advice is candid free and disinterested since it will be allowed that as there cannot be two suns neither can there be two garricks since he like his own richard has no brother is like no brother he is himself alone  if then no similarity appears no corresponding features are seen upon a comparison that superiority of light which we allow him and which if we did not allow him the world would do it for us has raised him to an eminence above all in the theatrical walk and as a witty orangewoman said to a gentleman who asked where was his fellow meaning his servant by g sir not in christendom so we may say of garrick  not in the universe and for this one material mighty and substantial reason we exclude him from the stage that other people may have their turn to shine for if we did with him as juliet says of romeo take him and cut him out in little stars and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world would be in love with night and pay no worship to the garnish sun  mr garrick would possibly glitter every atom and particle of him and like a looking  glass broke into ten thousand shatters each brittle shatter would glitter and sparkle still  so that if the other actors eminent as they are each in his own walk will condescend to allow this superiority in mr garrick we think they will join with us in expelling him the house as an unruly member who takes up so much box that he elbows off every body else one whose voice is so loud that like that of sentor the herald it draws ten thousand voices whose tongues so voluble that he will not even allow the very women to indulge their favorite faculty of talking and sure when one man can impose silence upon so many women a task above the power of all the husbands in england or in the world to perform what must we think of such a sway such a dispotic sovereign arbitrary rule should not be vested in any subject and it is more than the grand monarque lewis himself would dare to do in france where his motto is sic volo sic jubeo nay his favorites pompadour would not obey so unreasonable a command and if he had the confidence to proclaim silence in a printed edict or declaration of his will he would in all human all moral probability raise an army of female insurgents to rebel against his throne and like sampson pull an old house over his ears we are delighted with the sweetness of the female voice as they are the most harmonious and shall mrs cibber mrs pritchard mrs clive miss macklin and the other actresses give up a privilege they have a right to enjoy a perogative they have maintained since the days of old mother eve who no doubt enjoyed it in its full extent nor shall we join with mr garrick or any other man or set of man in the kingdom to impose this unreasonable injunction on women who have given us such uncommon pleasure either in the tender or the elevated tones of their voices  it would be an act more cruel than castration to men by which the italians equip their children for the opera and i will speak for any of the above actresses and promise this in their name that they would think such dilapidation for procuring men a voice would be less cruel than to take the voice of women by any means nay i will vouch for them all that they would rather be martyrs and suffer themselves to be stoned to death as the italians are stoned for life than to suffer the forfeiture of so rich a treasure or to cede by what treaty soever upon any terms or conditions clause or clauses that high and mighty female right the use of their tongues and therefore we still continue to affirm as we have sufficiently proved our assertion by many solid reasons that this unreasonable man david garrick esquire should not appear on the stage and we hope you will show him this letter nay we request it of you and his abdicating the throne of his ancestors and resigning his theatrical authority we dont mean management will for ever oblige  sir your most obedient humble servant y z  postcript something i intended to say when i first sat down to write this epistle but it slipped my memory occasioned by the zeal i entertain for exterpating garrick and has again this moment occured to me  in the name of commonsense are we to have nothing new at your house is variety never to please our imagination shall we neither have a new play nor a new performer but will you persist and again lead us through that beaten path we have all these ten years walked in  if we have not something new form you within this mouth i shall be necessitated to give my vote for keeping garrick at drury lane  now sir after having requested of you something new i would recommend to your memory some account of mademoiselle de clairon a celebrated actress at paris of whom you doubtless have heard i mean by giving you this account of her that you may instruct the novices that may offer  her first appearance is excessively engaging she never comes in staring round upon the company as if she intended to count of benefits of the house or at least to see as well as be seen her eyes are always at first intently fixed upon the persons of the drama and she lifts them by degrees with enchanting diffidence upon the spectators her first speech or at least the first part of it is delivered with scarce any motion of the arm her hands and her tongue never set out together but the one prepares us for the other she sometimes begins with a mute eloquent attitude but never goes forward all at once with hands eyes head and voice this observation though it may appear of no importance should certainly be adverted to  by this simple beginning she gives herself a power of rising in the scene as she proceeds every gesture every look acquires new violence till at last transported she fills the whole vehemence of the part and all the idea of the poet  her hands are not alternately stretched out and then drawn in again as with the singing women at sadlerswells they are employed with graceful variety and every moment please with new and unexpected eloquence  finis
