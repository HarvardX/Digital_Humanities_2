patie and peggy or the fair foundling  a scotch ballad opera as it is acted at the theater royal in drury lane by his majestys servants  vix ea nostra voco with the music prefixed to each song  london printed for j watts at the printingoffice in wildcourt near lincolns end fields mdccxxx price   s  preface that i am indebted to mr ramsays gentle shepherd  a scotch pastoral comedy wrote originally in five acts for the greatest part of the following piece was not owing to my idleness but a doubt of my abilities to produce any thing entirely new of this kind that might plead so much pretense to favor as nature is the same in all ages and climes i thought the simplicity of characters manners sentiments and passions which has gained that poem its reputation could not prove unentertaining to an english audience which induced me to turn it into a ballad opera and as the beauties of the original have been thought many i have scarce ventured to make any farther alterations than were absolutely necessary in bringing the tale within the compass of one act adding to the number of the songs and changing it into the english dialect without which it had not been intelligible to our auditors nor indeed had i time to vary it more my benefit being fixed before i had laid my design which was pland and finished in one day when i mention my benefit i cannot omit the opportunity of returning my grateful humble thanks to all whose favors i have been so frequently honored with and hope i am not too vain when i declare it ever was and will be my utmost ambition to deserve such kindness by my frequent endeavors whenever i may have power and as far as my poor capacity will allow to add to the variety of public diversions the warmth of my heart might make me tedious and impertinent should i proceed i shall therefore only add though the characters in this opera are low i flatter myself they will not appear distasteful to the politest circle of our english beauties  theater royal april the
