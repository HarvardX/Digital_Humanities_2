means of escape she suddenly embraced the resolution of trusting entirely for protection to his generosity the man whose humanity and generous spirit had been obscured not entirely lost by his vicious

for the vase at bath easton upon dreams november       i as echos voice returns the pleasing lay so is a dream the echo of the day the busy thoughts that round some object teem often join in sleep to form the nightly theme then brighteyd fancy lifts her magic wand while scenes unreal rise at her command then comedy with all her laughing train straight issues from the porch of comus fane and bringing with her all her pleasing wiles her pranks her gambols and her winning smiles she bids her merry troop approach the bed and beat their airy dance round ansteys head ii still when some chosen fair commands the heart gay fancy acts at night her mimic part with skillful hand she decks the living scene and ushers to the view the bosoms queen ye lovers answer to the truth i sing say does not fancy to your stumber bring dressed by each grace in beautys best array the welcome fair who charmed you through the day does not her form return to glad the sight like cynthia bursting through the cloud of night how pleased each wellknown feature we descry that look of sense  that eloquence of eye  she speaks  her words beyond vain musics art steal on our slumber and enchant the heart iii sometimes a dream anticipates the date comes as a prophet to reveal our fate and thus ere yorick sunk into the tomb the priest of sentiment foresaw his doom twas night  his solitary couch he pressed till sorrowworn he wearied into rest eliza then softgliding on his view thus over his slumber breathed her sad adieu oh thou my guardian confident and friend to what thy handmaid now reveals attend no longer now the gift of health implore the curtain drops and thy short scene is over yet ere thy feeling spirit takes its flight yet ere i am robbed of all my bliss thy sight some fond endearment to eliza show and thy last blessing on thy child bestow the vision ceased  yet then the shaul she spread see the letters to eliza  to raise compassionate his drooping head and from her eyes as beads of sorrow fell low on her knees received his last farewell iv often playful fancy sheds a brighter beam and prompts the splendid allegoric dream thus late while sleep my closing eyelids sealed this visionary scene she then revealed methought encompass d by a brilliant train i reached the steps of bright minervas fane full in the midst a mystic vase i viewed round which the muses newblown flowerets strewn armed with the lyre i saw a youthful band who waked the sounding chords with skillful hand unnumberd beauties silent stood around who graced as softer priests the hallowed ground there virtue wore her most attractive mein and in the form of marlborough was seen the graces skilled the cultured mind to win knocked at the door and bamfylde let them in this visionary scene by

splendid dream is realized in you albina would genius to my fond demand my earnest bold request bestow a vivid pencil to this hand dipped in the brilliant vernal bow how eager would i then engage with faithful and unerring aim to paint on the poetic page albinas elegance of frame her tresses  dark with auburn hue her brow serene  young candours throne her timid eye  whose languid blue sheds charms peculiarly its own her cheek  that wears a lively glow not after the fresh morning shower can italys rich summer show on all her banks so bright a flower her cherry lip  inviting bliss where love deliciously reposes accompanied by many a kiss on fragrant leaves of breathing roses yet who can paint her beauteous mind there innocence has fixed her seat there easy wit and taste refined and sentiment and knowledge meet love who often whelms the fair in woe soon robbed her guiless mind of rest affections flame dissolved the snow that lodged within her spotless breast as still the east the mornbeams streak and gild the portal of the day so did her morning thought still break on the same youth with ardors ray as the last glimmrings of the sky pause on the lake ere they expire each night her thought as closed her eye died on the youth of her desire the nuptials eager to profane the bold unfeeling treacherous youth led the chaste maiden to the fane with all the mockery of truth there a domestic in disguise the office of a priest supplied while the deceiver led by vice religions dread reproach defied hypocrisy with downcast air profaness with an atheist eye and lust with a malignant leer remarked the mockconnubial tie no sooner had the youth prevailed successful in his impious aim he left the drooping fair assailed by grief by infamy and shame twas then the beauteous mourner wooed meek quiet in her lonely seat where competency watchful strewn her sober treasures at her feet i will not the little pathway tell that winds to thy sequestered scene where virtue loves with thee

fall with wounds overspread bold on his bosom every wound he bore i rent the forelock from his murderers head and left him breathless on the crimson shore since that sad day my hours no pleasure share  the indian chief now paused with sorrow fraught wrapped in the awful silence of despair at length in words he clothed his mournful thought behold that sun how bright it shines to you since that sad day to me it looks a cloud how gay you blooming roses meet your view to me grief drops over natures breast a shroud go virtuous stranger to thy father go wipe from his furrowed cheek misfortunes tear

the lingering light hung trembling on the verge of night camilla then with fearful soul to the adriatic margin stole where in a bark at loves command placentio took his faithful stand possessing now his future bride he bade the bark securely glide which far unlike that gally showed that down the silver cydnus rowed beneath whose purple sails were seen proud ostentiations gaudy queen who sure of conquest vain of mind all languishingly lay reclined here beauty undefiled by art whose bosom owned a tender heart beneath the sails from home removed and trusted to the man she loved a soothing calmness lulled the deep and hushed each wavy surge to sleep the air along the sultry day scorched by the summers fervent ray was freshend by a recent shower while silence solemnized the hour the still solemnity impressed with awful thoughts camillas breast for now by prompting love impelled now by timidity witheld the words which to pronounce she tried recoiled and unaccented died placento too alike subdued they sailed along in silent mood and stillness reigned from shore to shore unbroke  but by the dashing oar at length the fair dissolved the charm  ah wonder not i feel alarm confiding in thy love i came and riskd for thee my virgin fame ah tell me to what place we sail for in my bosom fears prevail yet answer not this idle fear whereer thou art bright honors there the plan i form the youth replied to innocence is close allied and fearful of thy virgin fame as of her babe the tender dame these waves that wander to the sea wash in their pilgrimage a tree which spreads its lowly branches wide and dips them in the passing tide there in a shed composed of reeds an aged hermit tells his beads he generous sage will join our hands in wedlocks unremitting bands then to valclusa well repair where lauras soul informs the air where petrarchs spirit hovers round the guardian of the sacred ground forbidding still that fiend of art that shrewd perverter of the heart the snake inconstancy to rove within the paradise of love as when chill winter quits the land the snowdrop does her leaves expand so may chill fears your breast release till gently it expands to peace mild as these twilight breezes blow soft as the waves on which we flow ye walls where first i drew the air returnd assured the beauteous fair ye turrets which but dimly seen encrease the terror of the scene ye stately towers and rising spires from you camilla now retires thou tomb whose pious urn contains my sacred parents cold remains ye partners of my tender years whom youthful sympathy endears ye joys that crown my native coast well for placentio all are lost she ceased  and on her pensive soul agian an awful musing stole such as the twilight scene excites such as the feeling heart delights for as the coy nocturnal flower the nightsmelling geranium  no more its sweets at eve witholds so the meek heart at the evening hour its sensibility unfolds see now they reach the sacred cell where wisdom peace and virtue dwell there bent beneath the weight of age they find prepared the expecting sage he hailed them in a friendly tone and bade them call his cell their own where rose an altar formed of moss crowned with a simple wooden cross there too a taper mildly bright supplied a pompous glare of light no holy relick richenchasd this humble lowroofd temple graced but flowerets from the neighboring wood the unambitious altar strewn for incense they exhaled perfume for ornament they gave their bloom the hermit spoke  hail virtuous pair may sorrow now your bosom spare tho youth be yours yet well i know youve tasted deep of human woe control and art and baseness joined to cancel what your hearts designed but now misfortunes reign is over and pleasure opens all her store see now the youthful pair unite to meet the hymeneal rite pronouncing as they lowly bow warm from the heart the hallowed vow at length the hermit joins their hands in willing and unvenal bands unspotted bands which mutual love and confidence and virtue wove the mexican friends the sublime instance of heroic friendship that forms the subject of this poem is recorded by antonio de solis in his history of the conquest of mexico this is an episode of a more extensive poem and being the part that was the most favorably received i am not unwilling to sacrisice a few pages for the sake of rendering my poetical offerings more acceptable to the public  see to the fane hispanias troops repair whose high ascending towers are lost in air from whence the mexicans with speedy art shower on the foe the deathinflicting dart yet then by cortez led still undismayed the spaniard host the losty fane invade two valiant youths whom friendships holy hand had joined with her indissoluble band beheld indignant smit with patriot grief the great achievements of the hostile chief and now janellan thus accosts his friend firm to no purpose active to no end see from our gallant men you hallowed tower already ravished by the invading power must this committed to our mutual care the same defeat the same dishonor share if so  the victor shall not long survive  a thought that bids my fading hope revive a thought  that like the thunderflash of night darts on my darkened mind a radiant light  but ere my veiled designment i unfold declare however rash however bold thoult not oershade with cautions chill control the warm the splendid purpose of my soul venzula to his breast his hand applied and thus beyond the power of words replied the youth resumed  from this aerial height bid thy bold vision take its deepest flight down to you rock far stretching over the shore against which the raging waves incessant roar whose clashing voices into stillness fade ere this tremendous distance they pervade if fortune bless what my proud counsels urge yon waves shall murmur soon the victors dirge my secret project i will now unveil should cortez over this valiant band prevail should through controulment and through stubborn force pour like a torrent his destructive course when on this summit first he shall appear i will advance with welldissembled fear and suppliant as i kneel to win his grace ill dauntless lock him in a stern embrace bear him reluctant to you giddy steep where yawns a dreadful opening to the deep and thence  selfruind for my countrys good plunge with her foe into the whelming flood venzula answered  yes i much admire what now thy matchless virtue dares inspire but will thou with an avarice of fame the meed of glory all exclusive claim wilt thou to perils close to death adjoind advance and leave thy fathful friend behind in infancy we shared the glittering toys and in one circle played our harmless joys and when we quitted childhoods lowly vale where springing flowerets scent the playful gale still hand in hand we climbed youths arduous height whence greater scences expanded on the sight still our pursuits consenting to one plan like wedded streams our lives united ran and will thou now oppose the sacred tide and bid the friendly waves disparting glide janellan spoke  endearing youth forgive the conqror of some future cortez live nor mark my fall with griefs dejected brow view from my death the bright effects that flow behold the tomb that gratitude shall raise illustrious signal of my countrys praise to this the brave venzula made reply and as he spoke tears started from his eye what though felicity thy gift shall stream sunlike over mexico with brighrest beam not all the splendor that her rays impart will ever illumine my benighted heart when destitute of thee its only ray without the hope of kind returning day yet then to this great argument adjoind sublimer motives urge my steady mind recall recall that joydiffusing hour when gay prosperity adorned my bower as thy fair sister halfafraid to speak with downcast look and blushembellishd cheek at loves request affented to be mine of fleeting bliss vain momentary shine for she in flower of youth and virtues bloom was swept untimely to the ravenous tomb as sorrowwounded over her couch i hung to catch the tones that faded as they sprung the god she said now summons me away far from the confines of the endearing day thou of the life i lose the dearest part thou chosen spouse thou sunbeam of my heart say by affections glowing hand impressed shall i not live in thy recording breast if sacred be the suffrers last desires revere what now my parting soul requires i leave a brother by bright honor reared by all approved and much to me endeared be for the sisters love the brothers friend nor from his side depart when storms descend the palm of glory waving in your sight in council peril enterprise unite shall i when danger calls consign to air the last bequeathing wishes of the fair perdition catch the base unmanly thought by loves subliming purest dictates taught amid the perils that around thee wait view me resolved to share the impending fate now to this spot the foe impels the war discordance screams opposing lances jar the steep ascent lo cortez now has gained ah mark his spear with streaming gore distained the illustrious youths now act their dread design see at the victors knee they low incline now clasp with circling force the incautious foe and close adhering to his figure grow their deadly aim his better fate controlled with matchless power he bursts their stubborn hold the heroes blasted in their bold intent approached death hovering near the dire descent then in each others circling arms compressed the last and dear farewell in sighs expressed twas friendship burning with meridian flame on cause  one thought  one ruin  and one fame  tremendous moment see they fall from light and dauntless rush to never ending night ye selfdevoted patriot victims hail oblivions gulf shall never entomb your tale while history to times extremest goal her stream majestic shall through ages roll like two fair flowerets on one stem that blow ye on her margin shall for ever glow finis
