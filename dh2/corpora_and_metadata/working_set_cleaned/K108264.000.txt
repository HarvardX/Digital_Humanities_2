of isaiah in answer to dr w  mss critical dissertation on the same as approved and republished by the authors of the critical review remarks on the thirteenth fourteenth fifteenth and sixteenth verses of the seventh chapter of isaiah etc hear ye now o house of david is it a small thing for you to weary men but will ye weary my god also therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name immanuel butter and honey shall he eat that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good for before the child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings this text has in all ages of christianity been esteemed a clear and certain prediction of the miraculous birth of christ and therefore these remarks upon it would have been superfluous had not a learned and ingenious gentleman lately attempted to prove a contrary doctrine see critical dissertation on isaiah vii              viz that the prophet in this text had no reference to the messiah page     that the words of isaiah prove only that a young woman should conceive and bring forth a son without intimating any thing miraculous in her conception etc p    that from the most careful and impartial examination the word  here translated a virgin does not appear to signify strictly a virgin but that it seems to mean a young woman in general without specifying particularly whether she is a virgin or not p      this writer is not singular in his notions for the authors of the critical review have publicly professed themselves of the same opinion concerning this prophecy see no     fo      the most obvious and natural explication say they is this which dr w  ms the author of a concordance to the greek testament has adopted etc  i do not find that they have objected to a single part of the doctors work and therefore this public declaration certainly makes them parties to the whole nay perhaps i may say with justice that they are more concerned in publishing these notions to the world even than the anonymous author himself for instead of giving a short extracted account of the work as usual they seem to have copied the whole almost at length scarcely omitting a single circumstance  now i must acknowledge in justice to dr w  ms that i think he has set forth his hypothesis to all the advantage that it is capable of nevertheless he does not make it appear that the word  in any other place of the old testament where it occurs must necessarily signify a young woman that was not a virgin without which proof the common acceptance of the sign promised by isaiah cannot with justice be rejected especially as a virgin did afterward conceive and bear a son a miracle which never happened before or since the birth of christ therefore it was certainly a sign worthy of that great and wonderful event and from that time to this has by all christians except the author of the critical dissertation and the authors of the critical review dr w  ms has since informed me of one other writer of the same opinion concerning this passage viz the author of the assemblys confession of faith examined printed in      but at the same time he acknowledges that this authority was not known even to himself until several months after the dissertation was published and he declares concerning his own sentiments of the passage that he apprehended them altogether new when he wrote for says he i did not then know that any christian writer had so explained it  been esteemed the completion of the said prophecy  dr w  ms observes that the word  occurs only seven times in all and therefore i hope it will not take up too much of my readers time if i attempt to examine the context of these several places in order to ascertain the true sense of the word  the text wherein the signification of this word is esteemed the most doubtful is in prove xxx    where solomon mentions four things that were too hard for him in which number according to the english translation he includes the way of a man with a maid the sense of this passage is very different according to the syriac version wherein  is rendered  in his youth viz the way of a man in his youth and not with a maid as in the english version likewise the latin vulgate as well as the old latin version of st jerome conform in some degree to the syriac though not entirely for they construe it in adolescentia not in adolescentia ejus which is sufficiently clear without having recourse to dr kennicotts see his sermon preached before the university of oxford in       note   page    expedient of supposing a corruption in the present heb text to enable him to read in his youth as if it had been wrote originally   nevertheless it appears to me that the common english translation of this passage is to be preferred and that the word must here necessarily signify a maid or virgin for the writer seems to allude to the secret artifices and allurements used by a man in order to seduce a virgin such artifices as are hinted at in exodus xxii      and if a man entice a maid  etc therefore a word signifying merely a young woman or one that was not esteemed a virgin would not have been so suitable to the context of either of these passages the way of a harlot was too wellknown in former days as well as the present to be esteemed a mystery and much less a mystery to solomon who had threescore queens fourscore concubines and virgins without number see canticles vi   but it is not at all unnatural to suppose that this eastern monarch with all his wisdom might sometimes be perplexed with doubts and jealousies concerning the virtue and private conduct of some of those females as well virgins as others with respect to other men this it seems was by him esteemed as difficult to be traced as the way of a ship in the sea an eagle in the air etc by the sin of the adulterous woman to which the preceding similies allude as being equally uninvestigable such is the way of an adulterous woman she eats and wipeth her mouth and says i have done no wickedness prove xxx  0  solomon represents the great difficulty of detecting the inconstancy of any particular persons in the two former classes i mean his queens and concubines and he would not find it less difficult for some time at least to trace out the way or behavior of private admirers toward the third class of his women that were esteemed virgins in the eyes of the world  in confirmation of this i must observe that the strictness of the law of moses rendered the observance of secrecy absolutely necessary to offenders in this way for if a man was found guilty of seducing a virgin see exodus xxii    he was obliged not only to pay a heavy fine to the young womans father and to take her for his wife but was likewise deprived of an indulgence which of all others seemed most agreeable to the libidinous disposition of the jews at that time and was allowed them by moses only on account of the hardness of their hearts see matthew xix   i mean the giving a bill of divorce for in this case when a man was obliged to marry one whom he had seduced he might not put her away all his days see deuteronomy xxii     a punishment of greater mortification to the jews than any other which the learned philo though himself a jew heartily acknowledges  fol     paris edition    0   this certainly was a sufficient cause for secrecy on the mans part so that whether his way or behavior with a maid was really criminal or only imprudent for either of them may be implied in the text he would as much as possible conceal it from the world and render it as uninvestigable as the other things mentioned in the text to be too wonderful for solomon at least his best endeavors would not be wanting to make it so  neither can we suppose that the same earnest endeavors would be wanting on the young womans part to conceal her disgrace from her friends as long as she could but the reasons for secrecy are far more obvious in the case of espoused virgins for according to the law of moses deuteronomy xxii       if a man was base enough to seduce one of these an ignominious death was to be the immediate and dreadful consequence of a discovery when both parties must share the same wretched fate deuteronomy xxii         now if all that i have said shall not be thought sufficient to prove that  in this passage must necessarily signify a maid or virgin i have nevertheless the satisfaction of observing that the author of the objections in page  0 allows it to be a very obscure passage and professes to lay no stress upon it and therefore i think i may safely conclude at least that it is incapable of proving any thing against the true sense of the word in the other passages  the same author observes in page    that other four places are absolutely uncertain but they appear in a very different light to me  in the first of these places genesis xxiv    the word is applied to rebekah before her marriage who in the same chapter is said expressly to be a virgin  neither had any man known her see   th verse  in the second place exodus ii   it is applied to mosess sister who watched her infant brother during the time of his being exposed in the little ark of bulrushes  now it does not appear that moses had any other sister besides miriam the prophetess see numb xxvi    and exodus xv  0 and why her chastity should be called in question especially so early in life i know not  in the third place psalm lxviii    this word with the context expresses the damsels playing with timbrels in the solemn processions of the sanctuary who had they been damsels suspected of having wrought folly in israel deuteronomy xxii     that she die because she has wrought folly in israel to play the whore in her fathers house so shall thou put evil away from among you  they surely would not have been permitted to join in this divine service  the last of these four places which the doctor thinks absolutely uncertain is canticles i   where the same word is applied to the virgins that waited on solomons spouse but this uncertainty is easily removed by the other passage in canticles chap vi ver   where the same word is happily applied to the same persons who must be understood to be virgins because as dr w  ms himself acknowledges in page     i shall here add further that  occurs only seven times in all one of which has the appearance of being decisive in the case namely canticles vi   where virgins are distinguished from queens and concubines but this distinction is no proof at all because the same indeed a stronger distinction is made ezekiel xliv    in favor of   they are distinguished from queens and concubines  this one would suppose to be an insurmountable obstacle to the doctors argument but he passes very slightly over the difficulty and contents himself with informing us that this distinction is no proof at all because the same indeed a stronger distinction is made ezekiel xliv    in favor of   now i hope the doctor will excuse my want of discernment in not being able to discover the weight of this reason against so strong a proof as the distinction in question because if  is proved ever so clearly to signify strictly a virgin and indeed i know no reason why any person should doubt of it yet it is no argument why the other may not likewise signify the same thing for the word maid by having this signification in english does not oblige us to give a different signification to the english word virgin therefore i think i may safely conclude in the doctors own words that this last text has the appearance of being decisive in the case see page    and that the word  cannot signify a young woman that is not a virgin because by the same word in the plural number according to the authors own observation virgins the ingenious author of the new translation of solomons song observes in his annotations p    that the jewish maidens before marriage were under such strict confinement and so rarely suffered to appear in public that the very name for a virgin in hebrew is  hidden  this word is well explained by the learned stockins p   0    generatim and vi originis notat latentem    speciatim a proprie notat virginem quae domi latitat and continetur nec adhuc cum quoquam rem habuit ita dicitur de rebecca nondum propalam nuptam educta genesis xxiv de mirjam quae nondum rem cum quoquam habuerat ex ii   de puella incorrupta and illibata cui vir insidiatur ut ea potiatur prove xxx    de matre immanuelis illibata and concubitus ignara jes vii     b metaphorice virginum nomine veniunt pii saluandi ad indicandum eorum animi integritatem and puritatem tam in doctrina and cultu divino quam in vita and moribus cant i   vi   etc christiani stockii clavis linguae sanctae veteris testamenti vocabulorum significationes tum generales tum speciales ordine concinno exhibens etc   are distinguished from queens and concubines  i propose now to examine whether we may safely acquiesce with the author of the critical dissertation fo    and the authors of the critical review no     fo     in their opinion that isaiah in his prophecy concerning immanuel in the seventh chapter   th   th   th and   th verses had no reference to the messiah  dr w  ms objects in page   that the   th verse of the seventh chapter of isaiah cannot in any sense be applied to the messiah the words of this text according to the english translation are as follows for before the child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings  this verse seems to be the principal cause of his objections against the common interpretation of the two preceding verses  now though i do not think with him that these three verses must of necessity relate to the same person yet i apprehend there is a great probability that they may and that the   th verse may reasonably be accounted for even when applied to the messiah dr w  ms approves of the meaning given to the word  in the   th verse by mr mann viz that it may signify vexest instead of abhorrest the land which thou ahaz vexest with thy idolatry see fo    thus far he favors the explication which i propose to give of this passage but then he supposes that the land which ahaz vexed signifies the land of judah only the prophet meant to say according to this author says the doctor that the land of judah which ahaz by his idolatry and wickedness had brought into trouble and difficulty should be delivered from both these kings fo    by which the doctor refers to resin king of syria and pekah the son of remaliah king of israel who at that time were confederate against judah and went up toward jerusalem to war against it see the first part of the same chapter  the doctor repeats the same thing in page     viz  the land of judah which thou ahaz vexest etc this throws great difficulty upon the text which informs us that the land which ahaz vexed should be forsaken of both her kings the construction of the word rendered her kings requires us to understand that both the kings there spoken of should be kings of that land which ahaz vexed  both her kings  now pekah king of israel cannot be understood to be one of these if the land which ahaz vexed signified the land of judah alone for in what sense could he be called one of the kings of the land of judah who was not a conqueror for the true king still maintained his royal seat and title but a declared enemy and disturber and king only of israel  neither could resin king of syria be properly said to be either king of judah or israel for he was only an invader of judah acting as an ally to the king of israel  though indeed he had rather more right to be accounted one of the kings of judah than the king of israel had because about that time he had taken possession of elath a city of judah but this could not really entitle him to be called a king of that land because from the time that the city was taken it ceased to be a part of judah and was accounted a part of the kingdom of syria for it is expressly said in   kings xvi   that resin king of syria recovered elath to syria and drove the jews from elath and the syrians came to elath and dwelt there unto this day dr w  ms observes in a note page    that resin and pekah are perhaps here called the kings of judah because they were then in possession of all the country jerusalem excepted but the doctor surely did not consider that isaiah was sent to confirm ahaz that he should not fear the two tails of these smoking firebrands viz resin and the son of remaliah and to assure him that their evil council of setting up a king in judah should not stand  nor  come to pass it is not likely therefore that the prophet should call either or both of these kings kings of judah because it would have been absolutely a contradiction to his message which was to encourage and establish the then reigning king of judah descended from the house of david even the doctor himself seems so sensible of the insufficiency of his interpretation that he afterward in the same note proposes another expedient though a dangerous thus it happens with these sacred books as with profane authors that when the medica manus criticorum is to perform an operation upon the text it is often dislocated and maimed and rendered almost incurable by improper applications but whatever may be done with the historical books we have no right to indulge any conjectural emendations in the prophecies it looks too much like tampering with evidence if they are faulty they must even remain so and we must take the evidence as it comes to us dr gregory sharpes  d argument in defense of christianity p     one in hopes of solving the difficulty for the text not being capable of serving his purpose as it stands at present the prophet himself must be corrected  this is esteemed a much easier thing nowadays than for a critic to give up a favorite opinion that happens to be contradictory to the holy scripture  suppose says the doctor that we should read  for  her kings shall be forsaken of both kings  this indeed is cutting the knot but it will not enable the doctor to come off conqueror like the grecian hero if the omission of the word  in the septuagint translation should even be allowed to afford sufficient grounds for such a supposition yet dr kennicotts truly important work is not likely to furnish various readings from mss equal in authority and antiquity with those from which aquila symmachus and theodotion were taken these were manifestly according to the present heb text in this passage for it is rendered by all these translators  of her two kings or of both her kings  the ancient syriac version likewise confirms the text  both her kings it would have been time enough to have quoted dr kennicotts various reading when it was known that any such subsisted  for it is not fair dealing to wound the credit of the holy text with a mere perhaps dr kennicotts truly important work may perhaps hereafter strengthen this conjecture in a note fo    and for no other purpose if i may use the drs own words than to strengthen a conjecture in short i would advise the doctor to let the text remain as he found it for this unjustifiable method of solving difficulties is a broken reed which seldom fails to wound the hands of those who use it  now the difficulty ceases if it be admitted that the land which ahaz vexed signified the land or inheritance of the twelve tribes of israel including judah which construction the circumstances of those times will enable it to bear  ahaz had interrupted the sacrifices of atonement usually offered up for all israel in the temple at jerusalem which was common to jews and israelites and therefore might truly be said to vex the land of israel as well as judah for he not only sacrificed unto the gods of damascus   chronicles xxviii    but he cut in pieces the vessels of the house of god and shut up the doors of the house of the lord   th verse king hezekiah see   chronicles xxix who opened again the doors of the house of the lord and caused the priests and levites to cleanse all the house from the abominations of ahaz was conscious that his father by the interruption of divine service beforementioned had vexed israel as well as judah and therefore made all the amends that lay in his power he caused an atonement to be made for all israel for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all israel   chronicles xxix     he likewise sent to all israel and judah and wrote letters also to ephraim and manasseh that they should come to the house of the lord at jerusalem to keep the passover unto the lord god of israel   chronicles xxx   and we read in the   th verse of the same chapter that diverse of asher and manasseh and of zebulun humbled themselves accordingly and came to jerusalem and did eat the passover see   th verse now as it appears that the land of all the other tribes as well as the land of judah was really vexed by the apostasy of ahaz there is reason to suppose that the land of immanuel mentioned by isaiah viii   might signify not only the land of judah but the land of both the houses of israel  mentioned in the   th verse of the same chapter and that the two kings of the land mentioned in the seventh chapter may mean the kings or separate regal powers of these two houses of israel which were both to cease before the child immanuel should know to refuse the evil and choose the good the word  or king in a figurative way of speaking may very well be understood in some passages not to mean merely the person of one particular king but in a more general sense to signify a succession of kings or rather the regal constitution of a state and the failure of such royalty in some cases serves as a distinguishing mark of conquest or subjection to a foreign power the king shall perish from gaza and ashkelon shall not be inhabited says the prophet zechariah ix   by which is plainly understood not the destruction of a single king but the ceasing of the regal government of the city of gaza it is a synonimous term with the departing of the scepter the pride of assyria shall be brought down and the scepter of egypt shall depart away says the same prophet in the   th verse of the succeeding chapter the prophet hosea likewise uses the word  in the same general sense xi     the assyrian or assure shall be his king one assyrian king only cannot here be meant but the succession of kings reigning in assyria during the captivity of israel therefore i presume there is some ground for my supposition that isaiahs expression in the seventh chapter  may signify the two separate regal governments of judah and israel called in the twentythird chapter of ezechiel aholah and aholibah and not merely two single kings  when i first wrote this opinion and communicated the ms to dr w  ms i apprehended that the thought was entirely new  so little am i acquainted with the republic of letters for want of leisure and opportunity to read i must therefore acknowledge myself obliged to dr w  ms for his information that the learned mr mann in his dissertation de anno natali christi appears to be of the same opinion i had likewise the satisfaction afterward to be informed by another gentleman a worthy friend of mine that the same interpretation is recommended in the universal hist vol iv of the octavo p     with the note k  now that the opinion of the learned author may more clearly be understood i will set down at length the whole that he wrote upon the text in question  having mentioned the subject of isaiahs message to ahaz he adds  here the king whether out of respect or despondency and unbelief  refusing to ask the promised sign the prophet assured him from the lord that  before that time came a virgin should conceive and bear a son and call his name himmanuel or god with us and so on k  upon this opinion he further explains himself in the following note  k this we take to be a much more natural sense of that prophecy than to suppose as some have done that such a miraculous child was really born in ahazs time to assure him of the promised deliverance for as there is not the least mention of such an extraordinary birth so neither do we see that there was any necessity for it in order to convince the desponding king who could not be ignorant of that prophecy of jacob that the scepter should not depart from judah till shiloh was come much less that he was to spring of the lineage of david but what staggered ahazs faith and made him fear that the regal power was going to depart from his family was that his two enemies had combined to set a stranger on his throne all therefore that was wanting to dispel his present fears about it was for the prophet to assure him from god that this shiloh promised to judah and david who was to forerun the total excision of the jewish polity was to be born in a miraculous manner and with a divine character and other remarkable circumstances such as he might be easily satisfied had not as yet happened in his kingdom  as for that part of the prophecy which is commonly urged on the other side namely before this wonderful child shall know good from evil the land which thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings we think that if it be rightly understood it will rather confirm our sense of the prophecy and that the words ought to be thus rendered for or rather as the particle chi seems to import here nay before this child can know good from evil this land which thou not abhorrest as our version renders it but art so solicitous about or give up for lost shall be bereaved of both her kings by which we think ought to be understood not the kings of syria and israel for the former could not be called her canaans king and the latter had but a share in it at best but the kings of israel and judah as it really was before the coming of the messiah  in order to confirm this opinion i have annexed to these remarks two distinct dissertations one on the prophecy of isaiah vii     and within threescore and five years shall ephraim be broken that it be not a people and the other on the famous prophecy of jacob concerning the scepter of judah  in the former i show that the regal government of the house of israel as a separate state from judah was put an end to not a great many years after isaiahs prophecy  in the latter i hope i have proved that the regal government of the house of judah i mean only the temporal or worldly kingdom of judah ceased precisely at the time limited by isaiah in the prophecy now before us so that i flatter myself it will appear upon the whole that the land of israel including judah being the land which ahaz vexed was forsaken of both her kings or regal governments before the child immanuel could know to refuse the evil and choose the good  for herod the great on a careful examination i believe will be found to have been the last king of the whole land of israel and judah which ahaz vexed and it is remarkable that christ the true immanuel was a young child in the arms of his mother at the time of this monarchs death soon after which joseph the husband of the blessed virgin was warned by an angel of the lord in egypt saying arise and take the young child and his mother and go into the land of israel not the land of judah only for they are dead which sought the young childs life matthew ii  0  but dr w  ms in a note page    observes that the child immanuel could not be christ because he is never called the king of judah and he thinks that nathaniel when he called him the king of israel labored under the same mistake with all his countrymen who expected a temporal messiah the doctor observes in the same note that christ is king of the whole earth which he seems to assign as a reason why he is never called the king of judah  and indeed it does not appear that the doctor had any other foundation for his censure of nathaniel though this argument is so far from being conclusive in favor of the doctors opinion that it rather proves the contrary for he that is king of the whole earth must necessarily in a general sense be king of israel and judah these titles being most certainly included in the former even supposing the peculiar scepter of each kingdom to be departed  nevertheless the argument such as it is is admitted and approved by the critical reviewers for they quote the doctors words at length see no     fo     without offering any thing to justify nathaniel from the charge of laboring under a mistake  it shall therefore be my business to prove that the mistake does not rest with nathaniel  christ is in a peculiar manner eternal king of judah and israel as well as king of the whole earth and heir of all things heb i   the angel gabriel testified that christ should reign over the house of jacob which is israel for ever see st luke i    and the wise men of the east went to jerusalem and inquired where is he that is born king of the jews for we have seen his star in the east and come that is to jerusalem the capital of his kingdom to worship him see matthew ii     therefore the doctors objection that the child immanuel could not be christ because he is never called the king of judah seems to be entirely groundless for the dominion of the land of immanuel mentioned in the eighth chapter of isaiah may most certainly be attributed with more propriety to the messiah who was king and shepherd of israel see ezekiel xxxvii    also xxxiv       than to any son of isaiah whatever  dr w  ms may perhaps suppose that the kingdoms of israel and judah could not belong to christ because he refused to accept of any temporal government and withdrew himself when he perceived that the people would come and take him by force to make him a king see john vi    and further because he even declared that his kingdom was not of this world see chap xviii    but all this seems to relate only to the manner of his government which in general was merely spiritual he was nevertheless king of israel being sent in a particular manner to the lost sheep of the house of israel see matthew xv    and for a time jerusalem was the seat of his kingdom when he went up to the feast and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way a greater mark of submission than is ever paid to temporal princes and others cut down branches from the trees and strawed them in the way see matthew xxi   and cried hosanna blessed is the king of israel that comes in the name of the lord john xii     christ did not tell the multitude that they labored under a mistake in calling him king of israel on the contrary it appears that he approved of the voice of the people which could not have been the case had he not been really king of israel for when the pharisees said unto him master rebuke thy disciples he answered and said unto them i tell you that if these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out luke xix        0 thus was the messiah not only called but proclaimed king of israel and as such he received the homage of his people yet in such a manner as best suited the sacred character of him who had rejected a worldly kingdom for instead of royal apparel and a triumphal car he was clothed with humility and sitting on an ass that the prophecy of zechariah might be literally fulfilled  rejoice greatly o daughter of zion shout o daughter of jerusalem behold thy king comes unto thee he is just and having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass and upon a colt the foal of an ass zech ix   but though christ professed that his kingdom was not of this world yet there was no worldly man hardy enough to resist or oppose his will when he was pleased to exert his divine authority over them for he cast out them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of them that sold doves and would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple mark xi        and st john informs us chap ii    that he made a scourge of small cords and drove them all all such as are abovementioned out of the temple  of all the extraordinary things which christ did st jerome thought this to be the most wonderful as mr brag remarks in his practical observations upon the miracles this personal authority and dominion of christ in israel was expressly foretold by the prophet micah chap v   but thou bethlehem ephratah though thou be little among the thousands of judah yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in israel whose goings forth have been from of old in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god john i   from everlasting i never read any passage of scripture which was capable of affording the least countenance or support to the contrary doctrine that christ was not the king of israel indeed the enemies and persecutors of our lord at the time of his crucifixion expressed their disbelief of his being king of israel if he be the king of israel said they let him now come down from the cross and we will believe him matthew xxvii     because they did not think him to be the true anointed or messiah nevertheless when the several extraordinary and miraculous circumstances relating to the birth life death and persecution of that most holy person jesus of nazareth are heartily examined and carefully compared with the prophetical declarations concerning the promised messiah it manifestly appears that there were very sufficient reasons for acknowledging that person to be both lord and christ therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god has made that same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ acts ii     and the angel said unto them the shepherds fear not for behold i bring unto you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is born this day in the city of david a savior which is christ the lord luke ii  0     the word which god sent unto the children of israel preaching peace by jesus christ he is lord of all acts x       but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory   corinthians ii        that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father philip ii       and consequently king of israel in the strictest sense not only during his bodily residence on earth but to all eternity wherefore we ought most certainly to acquit nathaniel and other faithful israelites of the mistake which they have lately been supposed to labor under when they declared our lord jesus christ to be the king of israel john i    xii     thus far i have ventured to suggest in answer to dr w  mss declaration in page    that the   th verse of the seventh chap of isaiah cannot in any sense be applied to the messiah i hope i have proved that it may nevertheless i must observe that even the common interpretation of this passage is not so unreasonable as dr w  ms seems to imagine though indeed the interpretation before given appears to be much less liable to exception  the doctor animadverts severely on the opinion of those who say that the passage contains two distinct prophecies  viz that the verses    and    relate to christ but the   th to isaiahs son is not this says he very unnatural and if i am not mistaken very unusual  but the authors of the old commentary on the bible commonly called assemblies annotations were of a very different opinion  they observe on this very text that it is an usual thing in scripture with our prophet isaiah especially by way of allusion to apply the same words and phrases unto diverse subjects where occasion is to speak of them together and therefore they were of opinion that the child mentioned in the   th verse was no other in all likelihood than shearjashub the prophets child whom to this purpose god has commanded him to take along with him how far this was an usual thing with isaiah may be seen even in prophecies which were delivered on the same occasion as the text in question  for the further illustration of this point i have added to my book a short dissertation on the nature and style of prophetical writings showing that abrupt transitions from one subject to another are frequently found therein and that the holy scriptures afford many examples of prophecies which are blended and interwoven with other subjects that are entirely different both as to the matter and the time of accomplishment  we must not expect to find all prophecies unattended with difficulties nevertheless there are no difficulties in the seventh chapter of isaiah so great as those that are occasioned by dr w  mss interpretation of it this prophecy says he as i take it relates to one person only and that was the son of a young woman then present which son was afterward to be born see page    now i may ask with origin  contra celsum page    cambridge edition       who was born in the time of ahaz of whose birth this is said  emanuel that is god with us for if no one is found it is manifest that what was said to ahaz was addressed to the house of david according to that which was written  viz  of the seed of david a savior is born according to the flesh  indeed we read in the eighth chapter of a son which the prophetess conceived and bare unto isaiah and likewise that isaiah was careful to take unto him faithful witnesses to record concerning him for said he before the child shall have knowledge to cry my father and my mother which must be within two years the riches of damascus and the spoil of samaria shall be taken away before the king of assyria therefore this child was certainly the temporary sign of the promised deliverance from the two powers of damascus and samaria but unfortunately for dr w  mss hypothesis the said child was not called immanuel but mahershalalhashbaz  properly signifying and prefiguring the near approach of the spoiling of damascus and samaria now we do not read of any other child born at that time as a sign and therefore dr w  mss opinion concerning immanuel is not only a mere supposition but a very improbable one since it is not at all likely that two children were then born one mahershalalhashbaz and the other immanuel and both of them intended as mere temporary signs of the same thing  the doctor will find on a further examination of the text that the birth of isaiahs son is only an allusion or imperfect imitation of the former remote sign mentioned in the seventh chapter viz of immanuels birth in the same manner as the brazen serpent and the lord said unto moses make thee a fiery serpent and set it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that every one that is bitten when he looks upon it shall live and moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld the serpent of brass he lived numb xxi      and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life john iii        see mr crudens excellent remarks on these texts under the word serpent in his concordance lifted up in the wilderness was an imperfect imitation or type of christ crucified and that the temporary deliverance from the two kings of which the birth of isaiahs son was the temporary sign cannot rightly be considered as the accomplishment of the prophecy but rather as a confirmation and sure pledge of the said remote sign as i have before observed  but when the fullness of time was come the angel gabriel was sent from god to nazareth with a further revelation of the then approaching sign of the redemption promised by isaiah  the blessed virgin answered luke i    how shall this be seeing that i know not a man  that a woman should compass a man viz conceive and bear a son without the knowledge of man this was an event scarcely to be expected or comprehended by man it being the new thing which god had created in the earth spoken of by the prophet jeremiah xxxi    how long will thou go about o thou backsliding daughter the virgin of israel for the lord has created a new thing in the earth a woman shall compass a man jerem xxxi    so that it was plainly the seed of the woman which bruised the serpents head as promised in genesis iii    and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shall bruise his heel genesis iii      the occasion of isaiahs prophecy concerning the miraculous birth of immanuel is mentioned in the beginning of the seventh chapter  because syria ephraim and the son of remaliah have taken evil council against thee ahaz saying let us go up against judah and vex it and let us make a breach therein for us and set a king in the midst of it even the son of tabeal but thus says the lord god it shall not stand neither shall it come to pass  now this was a confirmation of the promise made by god to david and delivered by nathan the prophet   samuel vii    viz thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee thy throne shall be established for ever  therefore as justin martyr observes  justini dialogus cum tryphone judaeo page     paris edition       if the prophecy behold a virgin shall conceive had not been spoken to the house of david but to any other house of the twelve tribes the affair might have been doubtful but the sign was really given to the house of david see   th verse  hear ye now o house of david and as no man was ever born of a virgin except the messiah who on account of this birth was called the son of david therefore it was surely the properest sign that could be given to assure them that the house and the kingdom of david should be established for ever and that the evil council of syria and ephraim should not stand the house and the kingdom of david cannot be established for ever in the person of any of davids descendants except the messiah himself for with respect to the present times the worldly kingdom of david ceased very many ages ago and his people the children of israel being most deservedly ejected on account of their wickedness and unbelief from their old inheritance the land of canaan have never since obtained any other as a possession but for near seventeen hundred years have been dispersed throughout the whole world and yet by the manifest providence see bishop newtons dissertation on the prophecies  st vol p     to     where that learned author treats very fully and pathetically concerning the remarkable providence of god in the preservation of the jews of god they remain to this day in the midst of all nations a distinct and peculiar people so that their present state is an authentic and undeniable voucher of the truth of the holy scriptures what is occasionally said by moses and other prophets concerning the future state of gods people the jews is alone sufficient to establish the divine authority of the holy writings the promises made to them are literally fulfilled the vengeance denounced against them is literally inflicted captives they were frequently made wanderers they became and such they continue to be at this day sojourning in the

they still lie under until they shall repent  but christs spiritual kingdom of israel into which we are adopted is everlasting and the prophet isaiah gave ahaz and his cotemporaries of the house of david the strongest assurances that it should be so  of the increase of his government and peace says he in the ninth chapter which i have already shown to have been delivered nearly at the same time with the seventh chapter there shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this  in page    dr w  ms says the last objection which i know that can be made to my sense of the passage is that it is utterly inconsistent with the words of st matthew chap i        here i must entirely agree with the doctor though i am not the better satisfied with his hypothesis  now that we may thoroughly understand the text in question it will be necessary to consider st matthews application of it  he informs us that the birth of jesus christ was on this wise when as his mother mary was espoused to joseph before they came together she was found with child of the holy ghost then joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privily but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shall call his name jesus  for he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us now dr w  ms hopes to excuse himself and his hypothesis by alleging see page  0 that this is only an accommodation by way of illustration not proof of a passage to a particular sense to which it originally had no reference  but should we not seem to pay very little regard to gospel testimony i now speak as to christians if we were to suppose that the prophecy originally had no reference to this event when an apostle expressly affirms that it had  might not dr doddridges observation quoted in page    of the crit dissert be then with more justice urged against us viz this way of proceeding will make the scriptures the most uncertain writings in the world but now let us see how this notion of an accommodation will suit with the rest of the doctors hypothesis  he says page    i think that the prophet had no reference to the messiah and that the evangelist only alludes to this passage in isaiah because it was remarkably suitable to the matter which he was relating now the doctor seems to have forgot his former opinion in page    viz that the word  does not appear to signify strictly a virgin  for if this were true that  does not signify a virgin in what sense could the text be esteemed remarkably suitable to the miraculous conception of a virgin by the holy ghost and in what manner could the accommodation of it to that singular event assist the sacred historian by way of illustration see page  0  nay the doctor has even taken great pains to render the text remarkably unsuitable for he would have us understand that  the young woman as he construes it spoken of in the text was so far from being a virgin that she was with child is conceiving and bearing a son says he in page    even at the time when she was pointed at as he supposes in page    by the prophet these words viz is conceiving and bearing a son are a part of what he has given us in page    as a literal translation of the original but it is so far from being so that the true sense of the letter or text seems to be exchanged for that of the interlineary version of the london polyglot which renders it praegnans and pariens  but the words  are not participles active but are in the perfect tense yet there needs no apology for the septuagint and other translations in rendering them as if they were of the future tense because the sentence to which they belong is plainly the prediction of a future event  it is a wellknown observation of the christian and jewish doctors that the prophet seeing in his minds eye the events he foretells often speaks of them as already past dr sharpes  d argument in defense of christianity p  0   in a note  for in prophetical writings the perfect is frequently used for the future tense apud prophetas autem creberrime praeteritum pro futuro usurpatur quo res certo futura significetur perinde ac si jam evenisset ut puer  natus est nobis pro nascetur bythner institutio linguae sanctae p  0 dr w  mss literal translation as he calls it of the perfect tense into the participle active cannot i believe be so easily vindicated  would it not be very unnatural to suppose that the prophets have been entirely silent concerning this most remarkable sign of the messiah viz his being born of a virgin insomuch that an evangelist should be obliged to accommodate to this singular circumstance a passage which originally had no reference to the messiah and that he should attempt to pass such a mere accommodation upon the world for the genuine sense of the prophet by signifying in the strongest terms that this text was fulfilled by the circumstances which he there relates  the evangelist thus expresses himself now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet etc  etc which implies that if all this had not come to pass the word of the lord by the prophet would not have been fulfilled therefore this case is by no means similar to the instances of accommodation drawn from the grecian poets the learned author whom dr w  ms has quoted in page    has made a very necessary reserve on this head which the doctor has omitted in his quotation viz but indeed to an attentive mind the difference will appear very great between the citations from profane authors and the prophets in page     but why should any one attempt nowadays to explain away the genuine meaning of a prophecy so literally fulfilled by the miraculous birth of christ when even the jewish interpreters near  00 years i e according to the chronicon of eusebius     years before that wonderful event had construed the same prophecy in such a manner that it could not possibly be applied to any person whatsoever except the promised messiah who alone was born of a virgin  this testimony of the septuagint was taken notice of by origin contra celsum  etc quod si judaeus vocabula excutiens neget scriptum ecce virginem fed ecce adolescentula dicemus ibi legi vocem alma quam septuaginta interpretes verterunt virginem etc cambridge edition      p    p    and is certainly of much greater authority in favor of the true sense of the word  rendered by them  a virgin than any thing that dr w  ms has offered against it  it is remarkable that all the ancient mss of the septuagint in different parts of the world testify the truth of this reading of which four in particular are of considerable authority on account of their very great antiquity viz the vatican alexandrian complutensian and venetian mss and though many copies of the septuagint must have been in the hands of jews as well as others both before and after the birth of christ yet i never heard that any person ever produced a copy which contradicted this original reading for as the septuagint was the common translation used in the synagogues throughout all asia greece and egypt see bp waltons prolegomena ix p  0 no    any alteration in so remarkable a text as this would very soon have been discovered  and it must also be remembered that the several greek translations wherein the word  is rendered  a young woman viz that of aquila theodotion and symmachus were all made after the birth of christ when the unbelieving jews were desirous of perverting the true meaning of the prophecy  the ancient syriac version expresses  by the very word viz  from  which the doctor sets up in opposition to it and which he justly observes must signify strictly a virgin the rabbis always by  mean a virgin that they well understand their own language cannot be denied etc p  0  see also p    where speaking of the septuagint translation of esther ii   he adds whence it must undeniably appear that they understood  to mean a virgin in the strictest sense of the word  and lastly st matthew whether he quoted the original or septuagint was certainly convinced that the true sense of the word was  a virgin and he has accordingly left us his testimony of it which proves that the doctors application of this word to the mother of isaiahs son must be very erroneous  the child immanuel could not be isaiahs son because it appears from so many undeniable testimonies that his mother was to be really a virgin and because the event itself by which the prophecy is best understood has proved this truth beyond all contradiction  wherefore i think i may now safely conclude in dr w  mss own words before quoted that his opinion concerning this text is utterly inconsistent with the words of st matthew and of course that the doctor is indispensably bound to yield up his hypothesis to the superior authority of the evangelist  the end of part i a dissertation on the nature and style of prophetical writings showing that abrupt transitions from one subject to another are frequently found therein the same being intended to illustrate the foregoing remarks on the critical dissertation etc a dissertation on the nature and style of prophetical writings etc the prophecies contained in the seventh eighth and ninth chapters of isaiah seem to have been delivered during the general consternation of the house of david occasioned by the invasion of rezin king of syria and pekah king of israel because several circumstances relating to the said kings and their respective nations are mentioned in each of these chapters septimum octavum et nonum isaiae caput in eodem fere versantur argumento etc p d huetii demonstratio evangelica p      notwithstanding that the same chapters contain prophecies of very distant events which are so blended with the transactions of the then present times that it would not be easy to distinguish the real difference in point of chronology if the apparent accomplishment of these several prophecies did not remove the difficulty rezin and pekah are both particularly mentioned in the  th chapter wherein the extraordinary birth of the child immanuel is given as a sign the spoiling of their respective cities is promised in the  th chapter for before the child mahershalalhashbaz shall have knowledge to cry my father and my mother the riches of damascus and the spoil of samaria shall be taken away before the king of assyria viii   forasmuch as this people refuses the waters of shiloah that go softly and rejoice in rezin and remaliahs son now therefore behold the lord brings upon them the waters of the river strong and many even the king of assyria etc  and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land o immanuel viii        wherein the birth of the child mahershalalhashbaz the son of isaiah is foretold as the temporary sign of the same and notwithstanding that the greatest part of the said chapter relates to those times yet the prophet introduces in the very midst of it a plain reference to the times of the messiah see   th   th   th and   th verses which shall be hereafter considered in the  th chapter the presumption of ephraim and the inhabitants of samaria and all the people shall know even ephraim and the inhabitants of samaria that say in the pride and stoutness of heart the bricks are fallen down but we will build with hewn stones etc ix    0 therefore the lord shall set up the adversaries of rezin against him etc ix    these three verses  th  0th and   th and also the   st plainly allude to the subject of the  th chapter viz the evil council and confederacy of syria and ephraim and gods promise that the same should not stand is reproved and gods judgments are once more expressly denounced against rezin as if these things were to happen after the birth of the child that was to be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace of the increase of whose government and peace there should be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom etc for the birth of this divine person is foretold in the former part of the same chapter and yet i never heard of an attempt to apply this prophecy to a son of isaiah or to any other child born about that time  in the beginning of this  th chapter the prophet alludes likewise to some other historical circumstances besides what are already mentioned concerning syria and ephraim and these had either then lately happened or were very shortly to come to pass notwithstanding that the allusion is blended with a very distant prophecy concerning the preaching of christ  the circumstances which i speak of are the assyrian conquest and captivity of zebulun and napthali which happened in the days of pekah king of israel in the days of pekah king of israel came tiglathpileser king of assyria and took ijon and abelbethmaachah and janoah and kedesh and hazor and gilead and galilee all the land of napthali and carried them captive to assyria   kings xv     this was the affliction nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of zebulun and the land of napthali and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea beyond jordan in galilee of the nations isaiah ix   the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light etc ix   by the way of the sea beyond jordan in galilee of the nations mentioned by isaiah ix   by which he expressly points out the very spot galilee where immanuel was chiefly to be manifested by his mighty deeds and miracles for the prophet immediately proceeds verse   the people says he that walked in darkness this corresponds with the prejudice which the jews conceived against their brethren the galilaeans the chief priests and pharisees answered nicodemus saying search and look for out of galilee arises no prophet john vii    in like manner answered nathaniel when philip told him we have found him of whom moses in the law and the prophets did write jesus of nazareth the son of joseph and nathanael said unto him can there any good thing come out of nazareth john i       have seen a great light they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them has the light shined and afterward in the  th verse he renews the same promises given in the  th chapter concerning the birth of a divine child whose attributes and dignity are here so fully expressed by the prophet that they can by no means agree with the character of any other child but that which was truly immanuel or god with us therefore it is plain that the prophecies of the  th and  th chapters were delivered nearly at the same time with those of the  th chapter which are further explained and confirmed thereby so that if dr w  ms will carefully examine all these three chapters he will find that it is not unusual see dr w  mss comment on the opinion of those who say that the   th   th and   th verses of the viith chap of isaiah contain two distinct prophecies is not this says he very unnatural and if i am not greatly mistaken very unusual p    but an experienced writer who on many occasions has given ample proofs of great learning and scriptureknowledge informs us that it is very natural and very usual with the prophets to make a transition from one great deliverance to another as also from one great destruction to another  and he afterward gives several remarkable instances of it see dr gregory sharpes  d argument in defense of christianity p       in prophetic writings to make quick and abrupt transitions from one subject to another nor unnatural that a very distant prophecy should be blended with others that were soon to be accomplished because it is the nature of prophecy to be delivered in this mysterious manner for says isaiah xxviii  0 precept must be or has been upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak or he has spoken to this people and again in the   th verse here a little and there a little that they might go and fall backward and be broken and snared and taken the nature and reason of typical writings are strongly expressed in st marks gospel and when he jesus was alone they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable and he said unto them unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of god but unto them that are without all these things are done in parables that seeing they may see and not perceive and hearing they may hear and not understand lest at any time they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven them and he said unto them know ye not this parable and how then will you know all parables the sower sows etc mark iv  0      iv          wherefore it is our duty to ask gods assistance when we read the scriptures that we may understand them to our comfort lest they should be a stumbling block to us as they were to the unbelieving jews but not only the scriptures even christ himself became a stone of stumbling to the jews for about the time of his coming they universally expected a glorious and triumphant messiah to rule over them insomuch that herod the great was exceedingly alarmed with the apprehension of so powerful a competitor for the throne of david but when the desire of all nations see haggai ii   was really come his humble appearance meekness and disinterested though interesting doctrine did not in the least correspond with their worldly imaginations so that he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not john i  0    for the jews did not then consider any more than they do at present that the humility of the messiah was as expressly foretold by the prophets as his glory who has believed our report says isaiah in chap liii when he is about to describe the humility afflictions and death of the messiah he has no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men etc see the whole chapter who can read this oracle and not allow isaiah to have been what he is sometimes called the evangelical prophet is not this prophecy in every part as applicable to jesus as is the account given of him by the holy evangelists could it have been expressed in stronger or clearer terms if written after the event and yet it was delivered above  00 years before the birth of jesus dr gregory sharpes  d argument in defense of christianity page       the jews could not reconcile this unexpected humility with that glorious character which they so long looked for and desired viz a king that should reign and prosper whom the lord jehovah promised by jeremiah behold the days come says the lord  jehovah that i will raise unto david a righteous branch and a king shall reign and prosper and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth in his days judah shall be saved and israel shall dwell safely and this is his name whereby he shall be called the lord jehovah  our righteousness  jeremiah xxiii     see also xxxiii     where the same title  is given to the branch of righteousness mentioned in the preceding verse  compare with these chap xxx    and they shall serve the lord their god  and david their king  whom i will raise up unto them  the comparing of these texts together has occasioned the following remark which i find wrote with a pencil in the margin of my hebrew bible i suppose by some former owner of it messiah vocabitur david secundum carnem jova secundum divinitatem  ie christ shall be called david with respect to his human nature and jehovah with respect to his divinity  the divinity of the messiah may be clearly proved by a multitude of other passages even in the old testament therefore it behooves the authors of the critical review seriously to consider how those men can be justified who refuse the son of god the honor due unto his name since the father has committed all judgment unto the son that all men should honor the son even as they honor the father john v        a doctrine very opposite to this is approved and commended in the  0th article of the critical review for may    0 whereby it appears that the author or authors of that recommendatory criticism were not sufficiently armed against the dangerous and pernicious doctrines of the book which they undertook to recommend viz the trinitarian controversy reviewed or a defense of the appeal to the common sense of all christian people   to raise up unto david and who is likewise called as a name the most suitable to the only begotten son of god the lord jehovah our righteousness this unfortunate misapprehension was plainly foretold by isaiah when he warned the people to sanctify the lord of hosts himself  and says he let him be your fear and let him be your dread now what person could the prophet mean by this glorious title  jehovah sabbath if not the messiah for he immediately adds and he shall be for a sanctuary but or rather and for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of israel for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of jerusalem and many among them shall stumble and fall and be broken and be snared and be taken bind up the testimony seal the law among my disciples isaiah viii         we have the testimony of st paul in his epistle to the romans ix     for they stumbled at that stumbling stone as it is written behold i lay in sion a stumbling stone and rock of offense and whosoever believes on him shall not be ashamed romans ix       that this text relates to christ for he has there blended a part of it with another quotation from isaiah xxviii    therefore thus says the lord god behold i lay in zion for a foundation a stone a tried stone a precious corner stone a sure foundation he that believes shall not make haste  that is he shall not be subject to that kind of haste which is commonly the effect of fear therefore the syriac version has rendered it  shall not be afraid which is very expressive of the prophets meaning the lxx have rendered it  and st paul  that is shall not be ashamed which is still more expressive of a mans being free from that haste or confusion caused by fear not to be ashamed is frequently put for not to fear they shall not be ashamed in the evil time says the psalmist xxxvii    and again  they shall not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate psalm cxxvii    this i hope is sufficient to reconcile the seeming disagreement between the original and st pauls quotation   st peter likewise quotes it in his  st epistle ii   and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed and applies it to christ and indeed it can mean no other than christ crucified who as st paul informs us was to the jews a stumbling block and unto the greeks foolishness   cor i    but notwithstanding these plain testimonies dr w  ms is of a very different opinion isaiah does not seem says the dr in a note p    to speak of the messiah till the ixth chapter but though the dr here allows that the ixth chapter contains a prophecy concerning the messiah yet perhaps he is not aware that if his reasons against the common interpretation of the viith chapter on account of the present order and abrupt transition which he complains of in p  0 were at all conclusive the same would hold good likewise against the common interpretation of this ixth chapter wherein the transitions from one subject to another are equally abrupt and the remote events concerning the birth and preaching of the messiah are foretold even before other events which were immediately or very shortly to happen see p    the dr may be right enough in his observation that there are no instances of remote signs to prove the accomplishment of an event near at hand see pages   and  0 but it is plainly his own mistake which causes the difficulty that he speaks of for the sign given by isaiah of the birth of immanuel viz behold a virgin shall conceive etc was not a remote sign of an event near at hand as the dr supposes but a remote sign of a remote event and therefore not liable to his censure  the holy scriptures afford a great many other examples of prophecies which are blended and interwoven with very different subjects different i say both with respect to the matter and the time of accomplishment  there are also many instances of passages which bear a double construction being partly applicable to some particular person expressly mentioned though they ultimately and chiefly relate to another very different person  the prophecy of nathan concerning solomon is of this kind he shall build an house for my name and i will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever i will be his father and he shall be my son   samuel vii       king david himself explained this more particularly to his son solomon and applied it to him   chronicles xxii   saying for his name shall be solomon see the margin  peaceable agreeable to christs title mentioned in the ixth chap of isaiah viz  prince of peace and i will give peace and quietness unto israel in his days he shall build an house for my name and he shall be my son and i will be his father and i will establish the throne of his kingdom over israel for ever but where has the throne of solomon been established for near   00 years last past if not in jesus christ the spiritual solomon and prince of peace for though this prophecy plainly related to solomon yet it referred to a further acomplishment in the messiah by whom alone it could be perfectly fulfilled and therefore a part of it is applied immediately to christ by st paul in his epistle to the hebrews i   i will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son  of the same kind is the lxxiid psalm dedicated to solomon they shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure throughout all generations this is indeed applied to solomon but as the reign of that monarch was merely temporal the prophecy cannot be said to be fulfilled in any other person besides the messiah himself the true  solomon who reigns according to the psalmists expression throughout all generations  the prophet haggai chap ii promises zerubbabel governor of judah and joshua the high priest in the name of the lord of hosts that the desire of all nations shall come and that he the lord of hosts will fill this house that is the house which they were ordered to build with glory v   and he adds in the  th verse the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former says the lord of hosts and in this place will i give peace  says the lord of hosts  nevertheless in the former part of the same chapter the prophet appeals to those who had seen the house in her first glory and how says he do you see it now is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing v   thus it is plain that the glory of the second house did not consist either in the grandeur of the building laid out by zerubbabel and joshua or in the presence of those great and holy men notwithstanding that the prophecy is addressed to them both and that zerubbabel is spoken to by god in a very remarkable manner at the conclusion of the same chapter viz i will take thee o zerubbabel my servant the son of shealtiel says the lord and will make thee as a signet for i have chosen thee says the lord of hosts but the glory was manifestly to consist in the  future coming etc of the desire of all nations for as the promise was made to zerubbabel and joshua themselves the prophecy must necessarily be understood to have a more distant accomplishment which indeed the beginning of the sentence sufficiently proves viz  yet once it is a little while and i will shake the heavens etc haggai ii      the prophet zachariah likewise promises great things to zerubbabel and joshua which he applies personally to them as builders of the temple though the same relate ultimately to christ see chap iv     0  see also chap vi          wherein joshua by his name  which the lxx render  jesus signifying a savior as well as by his office and dignity of high priest was plainly set forth as a type of the future messiah  the prophet orders him to be crowned and saluted with the prophetical title of christ viz the branch of whom he foretold that he should grow up out of his place and build the temple of the lord  joshua might indeed be said to build the temple as well as zerubbabel but he could only be a type of the branch there promised because the real branch was yet to grow up out of his place and speak unto him joshua saying thus speaks the lord of hosts saying behold the man whose name is the branch and he shall grow up out of his place and he shall build the temple of the lord etc zech vi      the crowns were given for a memorial in the temple of the lord not of the accomplishment of this prophecy in the person of joshua but for a memorial of what should afterward come to pass if the people would diligently obey the voice of the lord their god and the crowns shall be to helem and to tobijah etc  for a memorial in the temple of the lord and they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the lord and ye shall know that the lord of hosts has sent me unto you and this shall come to pass  if ye will diligently obey the voice of the lord your god zech vi        thus we find that solomon zerubbabel and joshua as builders of the temple were types of the messiah the true builder of the everlasting temple of god i mean the holy catholic church properly the church of rome is very improperly called the catholic church because she causes a contradiction in terms by usurping that general title to herself alone when at the same time she scarcely seems entitled to be esteemed a part of it for notwithstanding that many worthy members of christs catholic church may have submitted to her communion for want of better information serving god by the sincerity of their intentions yet what agreement has the temple of god with idols   corinthians vi  0 wherefore come out of her ye people of god that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues rev xviii   she has perverted the law of god like the scribes and pharisees of old by her traditions  forbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from meats which god has created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth  which st paul   timothy iv   expressly called doctrines of devils she has defiled the catholic temple of god by building upon the true foundation wood hay stubble viz infallibility purgatory ostentatious penance mercenary pardons and indulgencies invocation of saints

holy water and salt benedictions of candles tablecloths towels etc baptism of bells and such other spiritual witchcraft  praying and bowing before images and shrines reverencing dead mens bones and other such abominable things etc etc these are no part of the foundation mentioned above of the apostles and prophets whose writings warrant no such idolatry exorcisms or enchantments and therefore even the holy scriptures themselves are prohibited in the popish index expurgatorius this last is indeed a precaution necessary to the existence of such doctrines for if the poor deluded people were permitted to read the scriptures they would soon be informed that there is but one mediator between god and man the man christ jesus   timothy ii   and that there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved acts iv    o that those men who invoke the mediation of all saints and angels notwithstanding the plain doctrine of st peter quoted above would consider what a gross affront by this execrable service they offer to christ who alone is the way and the truth and the life for their daily prayers witness against them that they do not esteem the mediation of christ sufficient for them otherwise they would not like the idolatrous israelites of old invoke all the host of heaven   kings xvii    the church of rome has endeavored to cloak this abominable worship with the subtle distinctions of latria and dulia but the necessity of such sophistical arguments proves the reality of that churchs backsliding to idolatry heathen rome was not more guilty of this crime nor has shed more innocent blood in defense of such abominations under the old pagan emperors than the present church of rome has done since her bishops have assumed their seat that is have possessed themselves of the temporal as well as ecclesiastical jurisdiction of that ancient city  so that the church of rome may indeed be said to have mounted the scarlet colored beast full of names of blasphemy rev xvii   and is accordingly most truly described by st john as a woman drunken with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of jesus  archbishop cranmer the bishops

the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief corner stone in whom all the building fitly framed together grows unto an holy temple in the lord in whom you ephesians also are builded together for an habitation of god through the spirit ephesians ii  0        compare the above mentioned texts with   cor iii    john ii        luke xx      acts iv    psalm cxviii    isaiah xxviii     it would make a large volume if i were to collect all the prophecies which absolutely relate to two different and distinct subjects in the type and antitype nevertheless i am particularly obliged to take notice of two more of this kind because dr w  ms has quoted them in favor of his hypothesis notwithstanding that upon examination they will be found to make much against it he says in p    it is not possible indeed to reconcile matthew ii      and perhaps some other passages in his gospel with any particular prophecy now extant in the old testament as to the   th verse wherein st matthew quotes the prophet hosea xi   out of egypt have i called my son the dr observes that the passage in hosea where these words are found is not a prophecy of a future event but a declaration of an event long past and therefore could not be fulfilled when the child jesus came out of egypt  now in one respect the dr is right viz that the passage with regard to the people of israel is a declaration of an event long past nevertheless he has not assigned any reason why the same passage may not likewise contain a prophecy of a future event by being intended like many other prophecies to bear a double application  erasmus has assigned a reason for the error of julian the apostate concerning this text viz that he has too much followed the septuagint edition nimirum secutus editionem septuaginta says he qui locum hunc transtulerunt in hunc modum quia parvulus israel et ego dilexi eum et ex aegypta vocavi filics ejus annot in matthaeum p   0  a misunderstanding of this text is very excuseable likewise in the authors of that greek version who could not easily comprehend before the event that the messiah should be called out of egypt as the children of israel had been before him and therefore they rendered the passage in such a manner as they thought would best point out the application of it to the people of israel only  and out of egypt have i called his children  but if the prophet himself had intended the same thing and that only he would most likely have made use of terms more expressive of a nation or people than of a single person from egypt have i called my son  and then the greek interpreters would not have been obliged to leave the literal sense of the original in order to adopt it with propriety to the people of israel which proves that some single person is more particularly pointed at by the prophet than the people of israel  there are indeed many passages of scripture wherein nations are represented by single persons ezekiel warned the two houses of israel under the figure of two adulterous women aholah and aholibah etc but the text in question is very different from many others of that kind for the people of israel are not only represented therein under the figure of a single person but some eminent single person is likewise plainly represented at the same time under the name and figure of the people of israel of which the particularity of the style affords evident testimony  when israel was a little child and i loved him and out of egypt have i called my son but the following part of the text wherein israel could not be a type of the messiah i mean their forsaking gods commandments and sacrificing to baal is immediately expressed in the plural number as being applicable to the children of israel only and not to christ  as they called them so they went from them they sacrificed unto baalim and burnt incense to graven images hosea xi   thus it is plain that the text is applicable in the first place to the children of israel who were brought by god out of egypt when they first began to be esteemed a nation and therefore might as a type of christ be likened to a little child being young and weak in comparison of their future state and power and  dly it is undoubtedly very applicable to the single person of the messiah who was also called by god out of egypt when he was really a little child before he could know to refuse the evil and choose the good the land being then forsaken of both her kings according to isaiahs prophecy vii    for the angels message or call of christ out of egypt was delivered to joseph upon the death of king herod the great at which time precisely the last of the two monarchies was dissolved  according to the plain literal meaning of the passage referred to by st matthew who quoted the sense of the hebrew text and not that of the septuagint version  the child mentioned by hosea as having been called the prophecy was indeed delivered in the perfect tense as a thing already past but this did not prevent the application of it to the future messiah because the perfect tense is almost as frequently used by the prophets in declaring futurity even as the future itself out of egypt is indeed expressly named israel but this is so far from setting aside the application to christ that on the contrary it affords the strongest confirmation of it for this name was necessarily given in the prophecy that the application might be double viz first to the people of israel and lastly to the messiah  the messiah is expressly called israel by isaiah xlix   in a prophecy which cannot at all be applied to the people of israel like the former but must relate entirely to christ viz thou art my servant o israel in whom i will be glorified xlix    indeed the true sense and application of this passage does not appear without the context nevertheless i am not sorry for the necessity of a long quotation from this chapter because it will convey a very clear and distinct idea of the birth and office of the messiah at the same time that it proves the point in question  listen o isles unto me and hearken ye people from far the lord has called me from the womb  the angel of the lord appeared unto him joseph in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost and she shall bring forth a son and thou shall call his name jesus  a savior for he shall save his people from their sins matt i  0     from the bowels of my mother has he made mention of my name  and behold said the angel thou shall conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name jesus luke i     and he has made my mouth like a sharp sword  he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth and with the breath of his lips he shall stay the wicked isaiah xi   see the context also  in the shadow of his hand has he hid me and made me a polished shaft in his quiver has he hid me and said unto me thou art my servant o israel in whom i will be glorified then i said i have labored in vain i have spent my strength for naught and in vain yet surely my judgment is with the lord and my work with my god and now says the lord that formed me from the womb to be his servant to bring jacob again to him though israel be not gathered here is a plain prophecy that blindness in part should happen to israel yet shall i be glorious in the eyes of the lord and my god shall be my strength and he said it is a light thing that thou should be my servant to raise up the tribes of jacob and to restore the preserved of israel i will also give thee for a light to the gentiles i the lord have called thee in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the gentiles to open the blind eyes etc isaiah xlii     a light to lighten the gentiles and the glory of thy people israel luke ii     that thou may be my salvation unto the end of the earth thus says the lord the redeemer of israel and his holy one to him whom man despises he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he has borne our griefs etc isaiah liii      to him whom the nation abhors to a servant of rulers etc  thus far may perhaps be sufficient to show the nature and design of the prophecy isaiah has introduced the important subject as the narrative of a dialogue between two distinct persons who are both mentioned in this last the  th verse viz the lord  the redeemer of israel and his holy one  whom man despises and who is also called israel in the former part of this chapter now it is remarkable that the people of israel or tribes of jacob are likewise distinctly mentioned in the same prophecy so that the person to whom the lord said thou art my servant o israel see  d verse cannot mean any other person besides the messiah himself he alone being the true light to lighten the gentiles and the glory of his people israel for though the jewish religion was for many ages the only true religion yet the gentiles were not induced universally to acknowledge the truth of the holy scriptures by becoming proselytes to judaism but by being converts to christ by whom alone they have been enlightened according to the scriptures if all these things be considered they will i doubt not afford sufficient proof that the text quoted by st matthew from hosea xi   though introduced in a context absolutely relating to the people of israel was nevertheless prophetically intended to be applied likewise to some single person and that the same was eminently fulfilled in the person of jesus christ the only begotten son of god whom the father called out of egypt by his angel jacob and the children of israel may indeed be called the sons of god but it must be in a very different sense from the former for they are only types of the true israel  the prince of god who gave this name to jacob when he wrestled with him that he might render him more conspicuously a type of himself viz as one that had power with god and with men and had prevailed jacob was sensible of the divine presence and therefore called the name of the place peniel  or as it is expressed in the margin the face of god for said he i have seen god face to face and my life is preserved genesis xxxii        0  i have already said so much concerning the nature of prophecy in general and have quoted so many examples of two different subjects being referred to by one and the same prophetical expression that i hope i need not any longer urge the reasonableness of a double application likewise of the text quoted by st matthew from the prophet hosea especially as dr w  ms has not assigned any one reason why it ought to be otherwise nor any authority whatsoever for his assertion in page    that the passage could not be fulfilled when the child jesus came out of egypt except indeed the authority of his own bare word which nevertheless seems to have had sufficient weight with the critical reviewers though it is opposed to the express testimony even of an evangelist  the other quotation of st matthew which dr w  ms has called in question is given in the  d chapter   d verse viz he shall be called a nazarene this is one of the texts concerning which the dr affirms in page    that it is not possible to reconcile it with any particular prophecy now extant in the old testament but he is greatly mistaken in this for the text may certainly be reconciled not only with one prophecy but with many very particular prophecies now extant in the old testament and therefore st matthew appeals with great propriety in this case not to one prophet alone but to the sense of all the prophets in general viz  that which was spoken by the prophets  for though the prophets do not say expressly that he shall be called a nazarene yet many of them do plainly allude to this appellation our lord was called a nazarene notwithstanding that he was born at bethlehem the city of david according to the scriptures but thou bethlehem ephratah though thou be little among the thousands of judah yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in israel whose goings forth have been from of old from everlasting micah v   compare this with matt ii   and john vii     he was sometimes called  mark x    luke xviii    xxiv    john xviii   xix    and seven times in acts  and sometimes  mark i    xiv    xvi   and luke iv     synonymous terms for a nazarene or inhabitant of nazareth which as dr hammond expounds it signifies the city of the branch or where the messiah the branch should be brought up an accordingly says the dr this becomes christs vulgar title    etc  now the messiah is called  the branch by isaiah iv   jeremiah xxiii   and zechariah iii    a plant or branch is the usual scriptureemblem for a child  thy children like olive branches round about thy table says the psalmist in the cxxviiith psalm  d verse and in psalm cxliv    we read  that our sons may grow up as the young plants therefore the prophets very fitly expressed the childhood and growth of the messiah by the word  beforementioned for it properly signifies not only a branch but germen a bud or young twig which isaiah further explains in the liiid chap  d verse by the word  a tender plant or sucker which is not only a fit emblem of the once infant state of the messiah but also of his gradual increase in strength and wisdom for he shall grow up before him says the prophet as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground by which he assigns the true reason of christs being called the branch indeed this whole chapter contains so perfect a description of christs human state upon earth that no miracle or demonstration whatsoever can be more capable of affording conviction and consequently those who have read it and still disbelieve are inexcuseable the prophet zechariah vi    speaks of the growth of christ the branch in the same kind of terms  he shall grow up out of his place or as it is properly rendered in the margin  he shall branch up from under him moreover this prophet foretold in the same verse that he should be named the branch   behold the man zechariah commanded that this prophecy should be spoken to joshua or jesus the high priest in the time of zerubbabel but i have already shown that he was therein only a type of our lord jesus the true branch  whose name is the branch plainly alluding by the sense though not the sound of this appellation to christs being surnamed  secessit joseph in parts galilaeae  ibique habitavit in urbe nazareth unde et christus nazareni cognomentum accepit matt ii       et nazarenorum christiani acts xxiv   j usserii annalium pars posterior p     the nazarene from nazareth the city of the branch  but isaiah in the xith chap  st verse not only alludes to the sense and meaning of this surname but to the very sound of it for he intitles him  netser a branch now christ was really called in the common syriac dialect   netseria a netserian or nazarene from  netsereth called from the greek nazareth where he had been brought up luke iv    and where according to the true meaning of the appellation netserian or nazarene when interpreted he grew up as a plant or branch for st luke informs us ii  0 that they viz joseph and mary with the young child returned into galilee to their own city nazareth and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit filled with wisdom and the grace of god was upon him  and again in the   d verse  jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with god and man this exactly corresponds with jeremiahs prophecy xxxiii    viz in those days and at that time  will i cause the branch of righteousness to grow up unto david  if all this be considered i think the fitness of st matthews appeal to the prophets concerning the word  cannot be called in question unless like the critical reviewers fol     we should believe from dr w  mss bare word that  signifies a nazorite which interpretation would indeed render it impossible to reconcile matthew ii    with any particular prophecy now extant in the old testament according to the doctors assertion in page     for the dr informs us in the following page    that the word is not  a nazarene but  a nazorite nevertheless it is certain that both these words signify the same thing viz a nazarene or inhabitant of nazareth and likewise that neither of them can signify a nazarite or as he spells it nazorite  for the hebrew word  separatus from whence these last  nazarite or nazorite are derived is no where in scripture rendered  or  but is distinguished from them by an iota in the second syllable viz  a nazarite judges xiii   and  nazarites lamentations iv   besides it is very plain throughout the whole new testament that christ was not called  as being a nazarite for he could not properly be called so according to the law of moses though john the baptist was really such but on account of his having been brought up at the city of nazareth which in the syriac tongue was called  not with  or  as nezereth but with  or  netsereth for the word is plainly derived from  a branch the name which the prophet isaiah has given to the messiah himself as is before observed and therefore st matthews appeal to the prophets in this case is very easily reconciled with the prophecies now extant in the old testament though the dr has declared that the same is not possible  even christ himself condescended sometimes to prophesy in the same kind of style that had before been used by his servants the prophets verily i say unto you there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom matthew xvi    and again if i will that he john tarry till i come what is that to thee john xxi    here our lord makes use of the same words and phrases with which he was wont to express his second coming to judge the world so that his disciples understood that john should not die whereas the event plainly showed that he meant of his coming so often mentioned in the new testament in judgment upon the jews at the final overthrow of jerusalem which st john outlived many years see dr cave on the life of that disciple antiquitates apostolicae p      our lord likewise used the same words and phrases unto these two different subjects viz his coming in judgment upon jerusalem and his last coming to judge the world when occasion was to speak of them together according to the observation before quoted from assemblies annotations insomuch that the day of judgment and the end of the world were expected to follow immediately after the accomplishment of christs prophecies in the xxivth chap of matthew xiiith of mark and xxist of luke concerning gods judgment in the destruction of jerusalem  the latter however may indeed be considered as a sign or type of the great and last day and the accomplishment of the prophecies concerning it is undoubtedly a sure pledge of gods future judgment just in the same manner as the temporary deliverance from rezin and pekah promised to ahaz and the house of david by isaiah was properly the confirmation and pledge of the future distant deliverance promised in the person of immanuel therefore if dr w  ms supposes as he hints in the words of mr collins in page   that this sign stood in need of other signs to manifest that god would perform it in time let him consider the context once more and he will find that the sign was not without such a manifestation as mr collins and himself have required perhaps it may be said that i have troubled my readers with a great many more examples of types figures and secondary senses than were necessary for the point in question but i was induced thereto by the too hasty censure passed on these sort of writings by the authors of the critical review in page     where they seem to condemn all types etc whatsoever indiscriminately without deigning to distinguish the difference between proper types and imaginary ones  the end of part ii a dissertation on isaiah vii   a dissertation on isaiah vii    within threescore and five years shall ephraim be broken that it be not a people the accomplishment of isaiahs prophecy in confirmation of which he required ahaz to ask a sign was not an event near at hand as dr w  ms supposes for no less a term than sixtyfive years was allowed for the accomplishment of one of the circumstances contained in it viz  within threescore and five years shall ephraim be broken that it be not a people isaiah vii    nevertheless the king or regal government of ephraim or israel for ephraim in this text seems to be put for the ten tribes of israel as separated from judah lasted no longer than about twentyone years after the prophecy was delivered for in the ninth year of hoshea the sixth of hezekiah the king of assyria took samaria and carried israel away into assyria   kings xvii   therefore commentators have generally found it very difficult to account for the number of sixtyfive years mentioned in this prophecy  a very learned and justly esteemed author bishop newton on the prophecies  in order to solve the difficulty has applied several texts in the second book of kings to an imaginary captivity or carrying away by esarhaddon which if the context be carefully considered will be found to relate undoubtedly to the real captivity under salmanasser we understand indeed from ezra iv   that the adversaries of benjamin and judah the samaritans dated the time of their settlement in the cities of samaria from the days of esarhaddon king of assure which as they said brought us up hither but there is no necessity to suppose that esarhaddon carried any people away into captivity from thence nor any evidence to support such a supposition was it not possible for esarhaddon to plant fresh colonies in the land of israel where it was too thinly inhabited by the former colonies without having carried away any of the inhabitants into captivity surely it was not only possible but most probable that this was really the case notwithstanding that several other learned men besides bp newton have thought otherwise and particularly fr junius quoted by dr simson in his chronicon catholicum pars  tia p    but the doctor himself sufficiently accounts for the passages in ezra chapter iv   and  0 so that there is no necessity to suppose another captivity under esarhaddon  quanquam enim salmanasar illam coloniam primus deduxerit tamen cum plurimi incolarum a feris and forte pestilentia sic enim ait josephus libro nono extincti essent postea plures ab asarhaddone illuc missos fuisse verisimile est and he likewise quotes nicholaus brabantinus to the same purpose  leones enim vastaverunt magnam partem populi quem salmanassar miserat propter quod iste asarhaddon misit alios loco ipsorum and cum iis unum de sacerdotibus captivis qui doceret eos colere dominum  the prophet does not say that ephraim shall be broken from a kingdom in sixtyfive years but that within such a time he shall be broken from a people therefore it is plain that the prophecy could not be accomplished by the captivity of ephraim and the destruction of the regal government of samaria by salmanassar because ephraim or the children of israel might be still called a people or nation even after their removal into a strange country for they could not be said to be broken from a people until the judgments denounced against them by the prophet amos ix   should be fulfilled viz though they go into captivity before their enemies thence will i command the sword and it shall slay them  it appears from the history of tobit that this really came to pass for he speaks of the frequent slaughter made of the people of his nation by sennacherib chap i       for in his wrath he slew many and even in the reign of esarhaddon about sixtyfive years after isaiahs prophecy notwithstanding that achiarcharus tobits nephew was appointed over all the kings affairs   st verse we find an instance recorded of the continuation of this persecution  for when tobit was told chap ii   that one of his nation was strangled and cast out in the marketplace he remembered  th verse that prophecy of amos as he said see amos viii  0 your feasts shall be turned into mourning and all your mirth into lamentation for it was then the feast of pentecost or seven weeks and tobit had sent out to invite such of his poor brethren as feared the lord that they might partake of the good dinner which was prepared but in the mean time he received this melancholy account see  st  d and  d verses which proves the propriety of his quotation from amos the same chapter of amos contains a passage very suitable to my purpose viii      the end is come upon my people of israel i will not again pass by them any more and the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day see  0th verse quoted by tobit  and all your songs into lamentation says the lord god there shall be many dead bodies in every place they shall cast them forth with silence i am sensible that the apocryphal book of tobit ought not to be considered of sufficient authority for the proof of any thing yet i hope that the remarkable correspondence it bears to the subject in question will excuse my quotation  moses also prophesied that the captives of israel should be persecuted  i will scatter you among the heathen and will draw out a sword after you levit xxvi     so we need not doubt but that by this and other such heavy judgments of god the captives of the ten tribes of israel would be so much reduced in number within the term of threescore and five years mentioned by isaiah that ephraim might well be said to be broken from a people for we read in deuteronomy xxviii       also every sickness and every plague which is not written in the book of this law them will the lord bring upon thee until thou be destroyed and ye shall be left few in number which agrees well with the expression of isaiah concerning ephraims being broken that it be not a people viz being now left few in number whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude  the completion of isaiahs prophecy concerning ephraim is very apparent even in another way for though some of ephraim and of all the other tribes were afterward settled in judaea and other places though we read of a remnant of israel see   chronicles xxxiv   that contributed to the repairing of the temple in the reign of josiah king of judah long after the completion of the sixtyfive years limited by isaiah and though manasseh and ephraim are expressly mentioned on the same occasion nevertheless this remnant of ephraim or israel could have no pretensions as before to be esteemed a separate people or nation from judah because they were once more become subject to the laws and regal government of the tribe of judah of which the authority exercised among them by josiah is a sufficient proof and therefore notwithstanding that on some particular occasions they were distinguished by their tribes yet as a body or nation they were generally afterward esteemed a part of the tribe of judah which accounts for the expression of the historian   kings xvii    there was none left but the tribe of judah only that is there was none left but part of the tribes of levi benjamin and such individuals of the other tribes as lived in or might have escaped into the inheritance of judah and consequently were all considered as the proper subjects of the kingdom of judah and have ever since borne the name of that tribe viz  jews thus the title of jews became general about this time to all the other tribes as well as judah for the kingdom of israel was never afterward restored in a separate state from judah and therefore after the captivity by salmanassar the land which ahaz vexed might be said to be forsaken of one of her kings for before the child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings isaiah vii    or regal governments  but the succession of the kings of judah continued regularly until the babylonish captivity and on account of this interruption or of others afterward the land could not be said to be forsaken of both her kings if the regal government was to be afterward restored for any considerable length of time and we find that many kings reigned in judah after that period i have already observed that when ephraim was broken from a people the national name of jews became general to all the other tribes as well as judah but it is likewise remarkable that about the same time the whole jewish nation including judah and benjamin as descendants of jacob began once more to be called israel as they had formerly been before the revolt of the ten tribes in the second book of chron xxxv    and said unto the levites that taught all israel which were holy unto the lord put the holy ark in the house etc  serve now the lord your god and his people israel   chronicles xxxv   the levites that taught all israel are exhorted to serve the lord their god and his people israel meaning the whole nation isaiah in the fortieth chapter   th verse why say thou o jacob and speak o israel my way is hid from the lord and my judgment is passed over from my god isaiah xl     but thou israel art my servant jacob whom i have chosen the seed of abraham my friend chap xli    fear not thou worm jacob and ye men of israel verse    see also chap xliii  and several succeeding chapters speaks of the whole jewish nation under the title of jacob and israel for though he might write these chapters before the change that i speak of yet it must be considered that he is addressing himself to the people in the spirit of prophecy and plainly refers to the latter times ezekiel iii   son of man go get thee unto the house of israel etc ezekiel iii    was sent unto the house of israel meaning the jews that were carried into captivity with jehoiakim get thee to them of the captivity etc see   th verse many of the other prophets expressed themselves in the same manner see zech xii   the burden of the word of the lord for israel etc zech xii   malachi i   the burden of the word of the lord to israel by malachi i   ezra iv   etc but zerubbabel and jeshua and the rest of the chief of the fathers of israel etc ezra iv   so that the national names of israel and jews were now considered as synonymous terms for ephraim the chief of the ten tribes was now broken from a people and therefore the name of israel did not generally distinguish them as a separate nation or people as before though indeed both ephraim and the two houses of israel the house of judah and the house of israel were sometimes afterward on particular occasions distinctly mentioned as in the thirtyfirst behold the days come says the lord that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah jerem xxxi    and fiftieth  in those days and in that time says the lord the children of israel shall come they and the children of judah together going and weeping they shall go and seek the lord their god jer l    this was plainly fulfilled after the babylonish captivity as the following verses testify  remove out of the midst of babylon etc verses      0 chapters of jeremiah and eighth of zechariah  nevertheless all the nation were the children of israel all were jews and in length of time the remnant of israel was so blended with judah that many entirely lost the distinction of their tribes ezra ii    these sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy but they were not found ezra ii     and more especially after the babylonish captivity when the prophecy of ezechiel seems plainly to be fulfilled thus says the lord god behold i will take the stick of joseph which is in the hand of ephraim and the tribes of israel his fellows and will put them with him even with the stick of judah and make them one stick and they shall be one in mine hand chap xxxvii    and in the   d verse i will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of israel and one king shall be king to them all and they shall be no more two nations neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all  agreeably to this prophecy the children of israel were one nation and under one king that is a succession of kings reigning one by one during the reigns of all the asmonean princes as well as that of herod the great until shiloh the prince of peace was come according to the prophecy of the patriarch jacob recorded in genesis xlix  0 viz the scepter shall not depart from judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until shiloh come and unto him shall the gathering of the people be  the end of part iii a dissertation on genesis xlix  0 the scepter shall not depart from judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until shiloh come and unto him shall the gathering of the people be a dissertation on genesis xlix  0 in the preceding dissertation concerning ephraim i have observed that the scepter was continued in the inheritance of judah during the reigns of all the asmonaean princes  and i believe the jews themselves will not deny that the said reigns include a part of the continuation of the scepter in judah as promised by the patriarch jacob therefore i presume it will not be necessary for me to examine the jewish histories further back than the time when the scepter was translated into the family of antipater so that i propose to begin this dissertation where i left off in the last viz with the reign of herod the great  herod had as much right to be esteemed a jew or of the tribe of judah the ingenious mr mann in the first section of his  th chapter de anno natali christi endeavors to prove that herod was really a jew there are likewise several other parts of that learned book which would both illustrate and confirm many of the points which i have advanced nevertheless as i cannot entirely agree with him in all his opinions and as i had finished my remarks except a short addition at the end of this dissertation before i had the satisfaction of reading his work i shall therefore content myself with referring my readers to the book itself  as the asmonaean princes of the tribe of levi for not only the descendants of the twelve tribes were called jews after the babylonish captivity as i have before observed but even the proselytes of the jews though they were by birth gentiles of any other nation whatsoever  this is strongly expressed by josephus in his account of king izates the great adiabenian proselyte see jewish antiquities  0th book the orleans edition of josephus printed in      fol     which is referred to as often us josephus is quoted in these remarks   which is thus rendered by gelenius cumque existimaret se non esse perfectum judaeum nisi circumcideretur paratus erat et hoc facere and again    neque ullo pacto laturos judaeum in regio solio the idumaeans or edomites thou shall not abhor an edomite for he is thy brother deuteronomy xxiii    i e  the patriarch edom which is esau see genesis xxv  0 was jacobs brother  from whom herod was descended were not only proselytes to the jewish religion but were still more nearly connected with the jews by having been governed by the same princes and laws from the time that they were conquered by john hyrcanus the nephew of judas maccabaeus so that from that time they were accounted jews as josephus testifies antiq   th book   th chap fol   0  and they were afterward as zealous for the rights and liberties of jerusalem which they esteemed their metropolitan city as the native jews themselves see jewish war book iv chap    page       thus it appears that the idumaeans as a nation had certainly a right to be esteemed jews  but king herods claim of relationship did not depend upon this single circumstance of his being descended from the idumaeans his connections with the jews were far greater than any other idumaean could ever boast of his father antipater though an idumaean was a person of such trust and esteem among the jews that he held the greatest offices under their kings  he served under their king alexander as governor of idumaea antiq book xiv chap   p      under their king and high priest hyrcanus as governor of judaea itself and commander in chief of the jewish army and afterward he served under caesar also as procurator of judae see the xivth and xvth chapters of the same book  therefore not only as an idumaean but also by these continual connections as well as residence among the jews antipater seemed to be entirely naturalized to this people insomuch that he esteemed their interest as his own their country as though it had been his native land his assiduity and diligence in repairing the walls of jerusalem  book xiv chap    when he had obtained leave of caesar to do so is a proof of this as well as josephuss manner of expressing that circumstance jewish war book i chap   viz   thus rendered by rufinus  et praeter hoc antipater impetravit ut subversa patriae moenia renovare sibi liceret and again  antipater vero ubi de syria caesarem prosecutus est in judaeam reversus ante omnia patriae muros a pompeio dirutos reparabat  if all these circumstances are considered it will not be easy to prove that the son of such a person ought to be accounted a foreigner to the jews herod was born a subject of the kingdom of the jews and publicly professed their religion laws and customs notwithstanding that he frequently offended against them all and if he did not think himself in reality entitled to be esteemed one of that nation he nevertheless omitted no proper opportunity of claiming relationship a remarkable instance of this we have in his speech to the jews when he proposed to enlarge and beautify their temple for said he our fathers built this temple to almighty god after the return from babylon etc  jewish antiq book xv chap    p      there are many other instances in josephus of herods expressing himself in this manner and indeed the singular circumstances of this monarchs connections with the jews rendered his claim of relationship so just that it could not be disputed although he was not descended of any of the twelve tribes josephus who called herods father antipater an idumaean does not deny that he was a jew but only that he was not descended from the chief jews who came into judaea from babylon which had been asserted by nicholas of damascus antiq book xiv chap   p     on the contrary josephus informs us that when the jews of caesarea contended with the syrians for the right of superiority in that city they alleged that the founder herod their king was a jew by birth  antiq book xx chap   p     and the justice of this plea so far as it related to herod was allowed by the syrians  etc see also jewish war book ii chap    p      etc  if all these things be considered i think they must justify my expression that herod had as much right to be esteemed a jew as the asmonaean princes of the tribe of levi and though neither the latter nor herod notwithstanding that they were jews were really descended of the tribe of judah yet the completion of jacobs prophecy concerning the scepter of judah is not at all affected by this circumstance  for the said prophecy does not i apprehend so much relate to the descent or genealogy of the individuals that were to rule in judah as to the particular preeminence of that whole tribe from which the scepter the sign of its being a distinct kingdom should not depart till shiloh was come therefore it is not so very material to my present purpose whether herod was a jew or not since it must be acknowledged be his parentage what it will that he was nevertheless king of judaea as luke styles him chap i verse   viz king of the tribe and inheritance of judah as well as of the other tribes incorporated therein and that he kept his royal residence in the capital city of that ruling tribe as did all the preceding kings of judah howsoever descended  an objection has been made to the common interpretation of the word  or scepter in jacobs prophecy viz that it could not with any sort of propriety be said that the scepter should not depart from judah when judah had no scepter nor was to have any for many generations afterward see bishop newton on the prophecies vol i p     but the learned author of this objection has not considered that the scepter or regal government in judah is plainly implied and foretold in the former part of the same prophecy which entirely removes the force of his argument in favor of a different interpretation of that word judah said the patriarch thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise alluding to the meaning of his name thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies thy fathers children shall bow down before thee genesis xlix    now notwithstanding the precedence of the tribe of judah in the encampments and marching of the israelites in the wilderness yet this part of the prophecy thy fathers children shall bow down before thee cannot be said to be fulfilled until all the other tribes became subject to the monarchy of the tribe of judah under david and solomon which is observed likewise by the authors of the commentary on the bible called assemblies annotations this say they was literally most verified in david and solomon who were of this tribe and spiritually in christ the lion of the tribe of judah rev v   to whom all knees shall bow phil ii  0  and they observe further that the courage of judah is compared to a lions whelp such was the tribe of judah in the first essays of war in the time of joshua afterward it increased to the vigor of a lion at full age and old in comparison of a whelp such it was in davids time and by age and experience subtle as well as strong for david of that tribe was so wise that saul was afraid of his wisdom   samuel xviii        and very courageous see   samuel xvii from ver    to    as the lion above other beasts who by his courage and strength is a king over them number xxiii    prove xxviii   and xxx  0 amos iii   mic v    if all this be considered it will appear that  in this text must be translated a scepter which is the opinion likewise of mons martin  quoique le mot hebreu signify aussi une verge and quil soit employe quelque fois dans un sens metaphorique pour la verge des afflictions la liaison de ce verset avec le precedent and toute la matiere contenue dans ce text ne permettent pas dexpliquer ici ce mot autrement que par celui de scepter de meme que dans ce passage de zachary chap x    ou se trouvent en hebreu les memes terms quici le scepter se departira degypte  thus it is plain that the regal scepter was not to depart from the tribe of judah till shiloh was come  now the messiah was not born until toward the close of king herods reign therefore the scepter of judah could not be said to depart or begin to depart  be departing as some commentators have fancied before that period neither could the the land which ahaz vexed be said to be forsaken of both her kings or monarchies whilst herod continued to reign in jerusalem but immediately after his death the form of government was entirely altered there was no longer a scepter in the tribe or inheritance of judah the jews had now no other worldly king but caesar for the peculiar scepter of judah was departed they were indeed subject to a scepter but it was the roman scepter which could not on this account be called the scepter of judah and therefore it is plain that at this time the scepter departed from judah a solemn legation of fifty ambassadors from jerusalem who were backed by eight thousand jews at rome solicited caesar that their regal government might be changed and that they might be added to the province of syria and become subject to the roman commanders that should be sent there   see antiq p         see also p         where the same thing is strongly expressed  nevertheless caesar did not at that time entirely comply with their request for as archelaus was named by his father herod to be his successor in the kingdom caesar was pleased to grant him the half of herods dominions but not as a kingdom for he allowed him the title only of ethnarch and as such archelaus had no more rigth to the ensign of royalty spoken of by the patriarch jacob in the   th chapter of genesis than he had to the title and dignity of a king which were never conferred on him though promised conditionally    antiq book xvii chap    p      from this it appears that an ethnarch did not differ from a king in title only  the dignity of a kingdom was then merely promised which is a proof that the ethnarchy at that time established was entirely without such dignity and archelaus was so far from obtaining the promised kingdom that about nine years afterward he was banished even from his ethnarchy see jewish war book ii chap   p      etc   in the mean time herod antipas another son of herod the great was tetrarch of galilee it was this herod who beheaded john the baptist in his territory of galilee and whose crafty base and selfinterested disposition was characterized by the messiah himself under the simile of a fox for in detestation of such pernicious principles he even named him from that wily animal go and tell that fox etc to this man was christ sent by pontius pilate not because herod antipas had any judicial authority in jerusalem but because christ was accounted a galilean and therefore pilate sent him as being one that belonged unto herods jurisdiction see st luke xxiii      when pilate heard of galilee he asked whether the man jesus were a galilean and as soon as he knew that he belonged unto herods jurisdiction he sent him to herod who himself was also at jerusalem at that time   judaea was indeed spiritually the kingdom of the messiah of which many incontestable proofs are inserted throughout this work and compared with the predictions of the prophets but with respect to its temporal or civil government it was so far from being a kingdom at this time that it was only considered as a part of the province of syria and for above thirty years together was governed by a regular succession of roman procurators josephus informs us that valerius gratus successor to annius rufus was the fifth governor of the jews and that he was succeeded by pontius pilate     antiq book xviii chap   p      until herod agrippa obtained judaea and samaria in addition to his former dominions of the emperor claudius who likewise confirmed his title of king this at first sight seems a weighty objection to the explanation which i have offered concerning the completion of jacobs prophecy but if we consider all the circumstances of this reign perhaps it will appear otherwise though agrippa enjoyed the title pomp and appearance of a king he was nevertheless subjected in no small degree as well as his predecessors the roman procurators to the control of the roman president of syria antiq book xviii chap    p      etc   for when he had undertaken thoroughly to repair and complete the fortifications of jerusalem marsus the president of syria had a watchful eye over him and signified his distrust to caesar who caused him to desist antiq book xix chap   p      and afterward marsus exerted his authority as president in a very remarkable manner even in the dominions of agrippa when the king himself was resident therein for being jealous of the friendship and unity between agrippa and several of the neighboring potentates who were come to visit him at tiberias he sent and commanded them all to depart to their respective governments which was a matter of the greatest mortification to agrippa   antiq book xix chap   p      these are proofs that agrippas power as a king was very much circumscribed in comparison with that of herod the great herod was so far from being subject to the control of the presidents of syria that he himself was made president of all syria by caesar  who directed the several governors to do nothing without his counsel and advice  jewish war book i chap xv p     see also antiq book xv chap    p      on the other hand likewise the reign of agrippa was so very short in comparison of the time that the scepter had been departed from judah that i think it can scarcely be considered as an exception either to the prophecy of jacob or to this of isaiah concerning the two kings especially as agrippa was cut off from his kingdom by a very remarkable interposition of divine providence for after he had slain st james the brother of st john imprisoned st peter and otherwise grievously persecuted the christians he fulfilled the measure of his iniquity by accepting the idolatrous flattery of the people at caesarea and immediately the angel of the lord smote him because he gave not god the glory and he was eaten up of worms and gave up the ghost acts xii    having reigned over judah only three years according to josephus who in the   th book of his antiquities chap   p     confirms the account given by st luke though in some particulars his relation is different   etc jewish war book ii chap    p      immediately after his death his son agrippa the younger being only an infant the kingdom was reduced again into a province  cypros  etc jewish war book ii chap    p      and never was any more restored for the government of the roman procurators which had been only interrupted by this shadow of a reign after eight or nine persons had been invested with that dignity was once more established and continued during a regular succession of seven other procurators until the time of the the general revolt of the jews when the just and dreadful vengeance of god was ready to overtake them for their wickedness and unbelief according to the express prediction of christ recorded in the gospels matt xxiv mark xiii luke xxi  agrippa the younger afterward obtained the kingdom of chalcis antiq book xx chap   p   0 jewish war book ii chap  0 p     chap    p      and some other dominions but he never had any authority at jerusalem except that ecclesiastical authority over the temple and priests which his uncle and predecessor herod king of chalcis had enjoyed before him for all judaea except two abila and julias cities in peraea and two tarichaea and tiberias in galilee given to agrippa were governed by felix the roman procurator  jewish war book ii chap    p     thus it appears that jerusalem had ceased to be the seat of regal government from the time of herods death to the total destruction of that city except indeed during the three years reign of herod agrippa but it is remarkable that before this short reign the jews had not only solicited caesar by a solemn legation of fifty ambassadors as i have before observed in page    that their nation might no longer be governed by kings but their chief priests had likewise publicly abrogated all pretensions that their nation could have to any peculiar scepter of their own for when pilate brought forth jesus in the presence of the main body of the people who were assembled at jerusalem on account of the passover and said behold your king and again shall i crucify your king they answered  we have no other king but caesar st john xix        this public acknowledgment of the jews that the peculiar scepter of judah was then no more the limited jurisdiction as well as brevity josephus in some parts of his history expresses a very particular respect if it may not be called a partiality in favor of the character of agrippa on account of his zealous attachment to judaism nevertheless the limited jurisdiction and brevity of his reign was such that even josephus himself did not consider it as a continuation of the regal government of judah for in the  th chapter of his  0th book of antiquities where he gives a summary account of the government at jerusalem under which the office of high priest subsisted from the time of herod the great to the destruction of jerusalem he observes that after the death of herod and archelaus the government or police was an aristocracy and he entirely omits any mention of agrippas reign in this place so that it is plain he did not think it properly an exception to his observation  antiq book xx chap   p  0  of herod agrippas reign and the want of regal succession for a long time before it and for ever after it are reasons which i hope will justify my suggestion that the said reign is not to be considered as a continuation of the scepter in judah and therefore it is most natural to conclude that the same really departed at the death of herod the great which period corresponds more exactly to the time pointed out by jacobs prophecy than any other shiloh the prince of peace was then come and herod convinced by the wise men from the east that a child was born king of the jews had attempted in vain to cut him off at bethlehem the general consent of the chief priests and scribes of the jews concerning the place of the messiahs birth is very remarkable for when herod gathered them together he demanded of them where christ should be born and they said unto him in bethlehem of judaea for thus it is written by the prophet and thou bethlehem in the land of judah art not the least among the princes of judah for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people israel mat ii      now though the jews still deny that our lord jesus was the christ yet they must confess with their ancestors that the true messiah according to the prophet micah v   ought to be born at bethlehem it is therefore a matter of the highest importance to them to consider what expectations they can reasonably have nowadays of the birth of a messiah of the seed of david at bethlehem since that place for so many ages has ceased to be the city of david for instead of the family and kindred of david it is now inhabited by turks moors arabians and some poor christians see bohuns geographical dictionary printed in       and further if any person hereafter born at bethlehem should pretend to be the son of david or of the seed of david the jews ought to consider whether it is now possible to trace that royal line down to the present time in so satisfactory a manner that they might safely and reasonably give credit to such pretensions but what is bethlehem now where are the thousands of judah of which this was one what is jerusalem now are the tribes preserved has judah still the scepter and the lawgiver where is its ensign displayed and who can now prove their descent from david all the signs  gem sanhedrin c ii    of the coming of the messiah are past etc dr gregory sharpes  d argument in defense of christianity p     o that the house of israel may consider these things before it is too late  for like the generality of the jews herod expected a temporal prince and therefore concluded that his own scepter and authority was in danger as it really was it being then about to depart for very soon afterward joseph the husband of the blessed virgin was warned by an angel of the lord in egypt saying arise and take the young child and his mother and go into the land of israel not the land of judah only for they are dead which sought the young childs life matthew ii  0  perhaps some critic may object that as christ was undoubtedly king of israel and judah the scepter of judah cannot be said to depart at the death of herod according to the interpretation just now given of the patriarch jacobs prophecy therefore it is necessary for me to observe that the scepter spoken of in this prophecy and the ceasing of the two kings or regal governments spoken of by isaiah can only be understood to mean the departure of the worldly scepter and temporal regal authority from judah and israel as necessarily to be distinguished from the spiritual authority and heavenly kingdom of christ for as christ was born king of the jews so the scepter of judah with respect to him is not departed but is everlasting according to the prophecy of the royal psalmist concerning christs kingdom thy throne o god is for ever and ever the scepter of thy kingdom is a right scepter thou love righteousness and hate wickedness therefore god even thy god has anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows psalm xlv      the other part of jacobs prophecy concerning judah viz nor a lawgiver from between his feet does not relate i apprehend to the scepter or regal government of judah for the particle  rendered nor in the common english version which divides these words from the former part of the sentence seems to point out that two distinct things are here spoken of as mons martin has observed car cette particule et marque que cetoient deux chooses different le scepter et le legislateur but as the accomplishment of prophecies is always the best interpreter i have been chiefly confirmed in this opinion of mons martin by observing that the departure of the lawgiver from judah was not less remarkable in the accomplishment than that of the scepter for the prophecies concerning both seem plainly to have been accomplished in two different persons  the word  must be understood in a very inferior sense from the usual acceptance if the jewish sanhedrin or the scribes and pharisees are to be esteemed lawgivers as some have imagined  the lord himself is called by isaiah  our lawgiver xxxiii    and as it pleased almighty god to declare his will to his people israel by moses and the prophets they also are entitled to the name of lawgivers as being the immediate instruments of gods revelation judah might likewise be properly called a lawgiver psalms lx   cviii   because the messiah was to be born of that tribe but the scribes and pharisees or the sanhedrin were not sent by god with any further revelation than what had before been given by moses and the prophets and therefore though they sat in moses seat matt xxiii   yet they could not properly be called lawgivers being only lawyers or expounders of the law of moses and if no person among the jews for above seventeen hundred years has had a better claim to the title of lawgiver than these it must plainly appear that the lawgiver as well as the scepter is departed from judah and consequently that the messiah came before that time malachi is the last person whom the jews acknowledge as a prophet in their canon of the scriptures and it is remarkable that almighty god was pleased to comfort them by this holy messenger  with the promise of another messenger or prophet behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord mal iv   this dreadful visitation of their nation was certainly accomplished in the destruction of jerusalem for if we examine the histories of former times ever so minutely we shall not be able to find any national afflictions or miseries whatsoever to be compared with those which the jews suffered at that time this ought to be a sufficient proof to the jews of the truth of christs prophecy concerning themselves recorded in matthew xxiv      when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by daniel the prophet ix    and xii    stand in the holy place whosoever reads let him understand then let them which be in judaea flee unto the mountains  for then shall be great tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be and except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened  luke xxi  0             and when ye shall see jerusalem compassed with armies then know that the desolation thereof is nigh then let them which are in judea flee to the mountains and let them which are in the midst of it depart out and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto for these be the days of vengeance that all things which are written dan ix       zech xi   etc etc may be fulfilled but woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days for there shall be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations and jerusalem shall be trodden down of the gentiles until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled luke xxi  0     for in those days shall be affliction such as was not from the beginning of the creation which god created unto this time neither shall be mark xiii     and mark xiii    so that as one part of the prophecy was so punctually accomplished they may safely assure themselves that such great tribulation will never befall them again according to christs promise in the same prophecy  compare the said prophecy with that of daniel ix        but though this great and dreadful day of the lord is certainly past yet the jews do not allow that the promised elijah is yet come nevertheless they sent priests and levites from jerusalem to enquire of john the baptist  who art thou  art thou elias and he says i am not art thou that prophet meaning most likely that prophet promised by moses in deuteronomy xviii    and    verses who was afterward acknowledged by about five thousand jews at one time for so many were joint witnesses of one of his miracles being convinced by all their senses of seeing hearing and tasting and he answered no  but notwithstanding that john was a different person from elijah the prophet according to his own confession yet he was most certainly the prophet promised by malachi under the prophetical appellation of elijah which denoted the excellency of his spiritual mission for the angel gabriel told his father zacharias in the temple that john should go before the lord in the spirit and power of elias see st luke i    and afterward christ himself bore witness of him  if ye will receive it this is elias see also matthew xvii  0     which was for to come matt xi    and in the same chapter he calls him a prophet yea and more than a prophet he being the lords messenger promised by malachi iii   to prepare his way before him  john was likewise a lawgiver  as well as a prophet and messenger for there went out to him jerusalem and all judea and all the region round about jordan matthew iii   and when he warned them to flee from the wrath to come the people asked him saying what shall we do then luke iii  0 and we find by the succeeding verses that he instructed them accordingly not only with general doctrine but even with particular advice suitable to the different classes of men these testimonies of the evangelists in favor of john are confirmed in no small degree even by the jewish historian josephus who calls him  a good man  for indeed his life and conversation was so exemplary and unblameable that many of the jews as josephus informs us believed the destruction of herods army to be a just judgment of god for the murder of that good man of whom josephus in the place above quoted gives us the following character that his whole crime was his exhorting the jews to the love and practice of virtue and first of all to piety justice and regeneration or newness of life not by the bare abstinence from this or that particular sin but by an habitual purity of mind and body  now continues he so great was the credit and authority of this holy man as appears by the multitude of his disciples and the veneration they had for his doctrine for he could do what he would with them that herod not knowing how far the reputation of a man of his spirit might influence the people toward a revolt resolved at length to take him off before it was too late etc he adds that herod was very unsuccessful in his war with the arabian king all which the jews looked upon as a just judgment of god upon him for that impious murder univ hist vol x p        see jewish antiq book xviii c    john was not indeed of the tribe of judah yet it cannot be denied but that he was a jew according to what has been before observed concerning the asmonaean princes and herod the king of judea luke i   and he might very well be accounted a lawgiver from between the feet of judah for he was born in the hill country of judea luke i    in a city of juda luke i    at a time when that tribe was in full possession of its inheritance  but the circumstance which more particularly points out the accomplishment of jacobs prophecy in this holy nazarite john was a nazarite unto god from his mothers womb as sampson one of the judges of israel had been before him compare judges xvi    with st luke i    but christ could not properly be called a nazarite as dr w  ms supposes him to be without a contradiction to the usual sense of that title in the jewish law is that john was the very last of the jewish lawgivers or prophets for though on extraordinary occasions some prophetical sentences may have been uttered by men adhering to judaism after the coming of christ such as the remarkable prophecy of caiaphas the high priest concerning christ  that it was expedient that one man should die for the people etc john xi  0 see what a manifest though unwilling testimony even the unbelieving jews bare of christs heavenly mission  then gathered the chief priests and the pharisees a council and said what do we for this man does many miracles if we thus let him alone all men will believe on him and the romans shall come and take away both our place and nation and one of them named caiaphas being the high priest that same year said unto them ye know nothing at all nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perish not and this spoke he not of himself but being high priest that year he prophesied that jesus should die for that nation etc john xi        yet the jews cannot prove that a single prophet professedly as such has been sent to them from god ever since the time of john that is for above   00 years except they will condescend to allow to st paul agabus and others of the primitive christians the title of prophets but these were under the dispensation of the new testament after the ceremonial and typical law was annulled and therefore cannot be reckoned among the jewish lawgivers or prophets  this was confirmed by christ himself luke xvi    the law and the prophets were until john  and again matthew xi       for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john  these are sufficient authorities i hope to justify my supposition that the prophet and lawgiver departed from judah at the death of john the baptist or rather was gradually departing for some time before his death because as christ increased john decreased according to his own prophecy recorded by john the evangelist iii  0 ye yourselves bear me witness that i said i am not the christ but that i am sent before him he that has the bride that is the church or congregation for john had just before been told that christ baptizeth and all men come to him   th verse is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which stands and hears him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegrooms voice this my joy is therefore fulfilled he must increase but i must decrease when therefore the lord knew how the pharisees had heard that jesus made and baptized more disciples than john though jesus himself baptized not but his disciples he left judea and departed again into galilee john iv        he that comes from above is above all he that is of the earth is earthly and speaks of the earth he that comes from heaven is above all and what he has seen and heard that he testifies and no man receives his testimony he that has received his testimony has set to his seal that god is true for he whom god has sent speaks the words of god for god gives not the spirit by measure unto him the father loves the son and has given all things into his hand he that believes on the son has everlasting life and he that believes not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abides on him  thus far the evangelist seems to be relating the testimony of john the second elias  in the  th chapter   st verse of the same evangelist we read that this remarkable testimony was afterward referred to by christ himself if i bear witness of myself said christ my witness is not true there is another that bears witness of me and i know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true ye sent unto john and he bare witness unto the truth but i receive not testimony from man  nevertheless our lord condescended to give the jews an opportunity of being convinced by the testimony of man a man whom they almost universally esteemed on account of the purity of his life which i have already shown from the authority even of the jewish historian josephus  the mercy of god therefore is apparent in this condescension and though our lord himself declared that he received not testimony from man yet he added  but these things relating to johns testimony i say that ye might be saved  he then gives a most lively and comprehensive though short description of the holy character of this his harbinger he was says our lord a burning and a shining light  and he reminds the jews that they formerly testified a very particular approbation of this holy person and ye were willing says he for a season to rejoice in his light but i have greater witness than that of john for the works which the father has given me to finish the same works that i do bear witness of me that the father has sent me and the father himself which has sent me has borne witness of me ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape and ye have not his word abiding in you for whom he has sent him ye believe not search the scriptures for in them ye think ye have eternal life and they are they which testify of me thus christ pointed out to the jews three incontestible indications of the truth of his holy doctrine   st the testimony of john the baptist with which he indulged them though the same might be esteemed unnecessary for the cause of him who  receives not testimony from man   dly his own mighty works daily wrought among them which as he said bear witness of me that the father has sent me  and  dly the witness of the father himself though as christ expressed himself to the jews ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape but he seems plainly to direct them to that witness of god which has in all ages been apparent in the accomplishment of the word of the lord by his prophets  even the unbelieving jews themselves pretended to believe the scriptures and acknowledged them to be the word of god and therefore christ referred them to the scriptures as being the witness of the father himself search the scriptures etc but they wilfully neglected to make a right use of such ample testimony and were therefore inexcusable do not think said christ that i will accuse you to the father there is one that accuses you even moses in whom ye trust for had ye believed moses ye would have believed me for he wrote of me but if ye believe not his writings how shall ye believe my words  in the very next chapter vi     the evangelist relates the accomplishment of one of the circumstances of jacobs prophecy as recorded by moses viz  and unto him shall the gathering of the people be  after these things says st john jesus went over the sea of galilee which is the sea of tiberias and a great multitude followed him because they saw his miracles etc and again   th and   th verses then those men the five thousand persons who were fed by christ with five barley loaves and two small fishes when they had seen the miracle that jesus did said this is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world when jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king for they could not possibly give him a greater proof of their sincerity in gathering to him as the true shiloh he departed again into a mountain himself alone  the people of israel as mr mann observes in his learned treatise de anno natali christi p   were not the only people that were to be gathered unto shiloh not one nation only is pointed at in the prophecy but many nations the patriarchs words were not  the gathering of this people or nation but in the plural number  the gathering of the nations which has been apparently fulfilled for the nations have at different times almost universally submitted to the faith of our lord jesus the true shiloh notwithstanding that many have since fallen back into gross ignorance superstition and unbelief we have a dreadful example of this in the present state of the once enlightened grecian empire of the greatest part of asia and of almost the whole vast continent of africa nay the greatest part even of europe itself has long since resumed the veil of its former darkness and the shadow of death for the superstitious vanities of rome bear too great a resemblance to the old heathen idolatries and the multitude of atheists deists and of those who neglect christs holy sacraments is an alarming indication of a falling off even among ourselves  the gathering of the people to impostors does not at all affect the certainty of the sign given by the patriarch jacob in the gathering of the people to shiloh  many false christs have indeed appeared according to our lords prediction in matthew xxiv    for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders insomuch that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect behold i have told you before etc  luke xxi   take heed that ye be not deceived for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and the time draws near go ye not therefore after them  and to such the jews have zealously gathered themselves for they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved and for this cause god sent them strong delusion as foretold by st paul that they should believe a lie   thessalonians ii     the same people who rejected the truth through hardness of heart and want of faith very soon afterward by a contrary infatuation rendered themselves despicable by the most absurd credulity  even the jewish historian josephus gives ample testimony of the proneness of his countrymen to error and false doctrine and that they were easily led away by impostors and deceivers he relates a very remarkable instance of it in their being led out by an egyptian to the mount of olives from whence he had undertaken to show them a wonderful spectacle viz that the walls of jerusalem should fall at his command antiq book xx chap   p       the same spiritual blindness continued even after the abomination of desolation notwithstanding the apparent judgment of god upon them in the destruction of their great and once holy city for they have as readily since that time as before acknowledged the incredible pretensions of several impostors who have at different times set themselves up for the true messiah for instance the infamous barchocheba  or son of a star in the reign of the emperor adrian was gladly received and zealously supported among the jews until an immense slaughter of his miserable adherents plainly demonstrated that he was more properly entitled barchozba  son of a lie the jews were also notably deceived by sabbatei sevi who wickedly took upon himself the character of the messiah but it is remarkable that it was the jews alone and not all the other nations of the world that were gathered to these counterfeits which ought to demonstrate to the present house of israel the apparent difference between the true messiah and the miserable deceivers abovementioned  thus i hope i have shown that the scepter did not depart from judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until shiloh was come and that the gathering of the people not of one nation only but of the universe at different times has been unto christ himself according to the scriptures  bring forth the blind people that have eyes and the deaf that have ears let all the nations be gathered together and let the people be assembled who among them can declare this and show us former things let them bring forth their witnesses that they may be justified or let them hear and say it is truth isaiah xliii      glory be to god in the highest and on earth peace good will toward men  the end of part iv an answer to some of the principal arguments used by dr w  ms in defense of his critical dissertation on isaiah vii             etc in which the opinions of the late dr sykes and dr george benson concerning accommodations of scripture prophecy are briefly considered an answer to some of the principal arguments used by dr w  ms in defense of his critical dissertation on isaiah vii             etc i have pointed out to dr w  ms several mistakes in his critical dissertation on isaiah vii             yet he has not thought proper to acknowledge one of them though he has labored to disprove several some of the principal arguments which the doctor has advanced in favor of his hypothesis are considered in the following pages  but before i proceed to a defense of my remarks it may be necessary for me to examine a very important question concerning the interpretation of scripture prophecies notwithstanding that dr w  ms apprehends the same to be sufficiently and even conclusively decided already viz whether any allegorical meanings and double senses of scripture prophecies are to be allowed  it is impossible says the dr to determine when any prophecy is fulfilled if it has more than one single sense if it has two says he it may have two hundred and all of them equally just  for the confirmation of this sentiment he refers me to dr george bensons preface to the first volume of his paraphrase and notes on st pauls epistles and to dr sykess connection of natural and revealed religion page     etc  these i have examined with as much care i believe as is necessary and find that the third objection to dr george bensons hypothesis quoted even in his own introduction p xxxiv obliges him to make such large concessions concerning types and figures that  notwithstanding his great zeal against double fenses his denying of them seems a mere disagreement in terms and not in effect from the general received opinion  in his answer to the said objection he allows p xxxv that wherever the law or the prophets have declared that the rites and ceremonies of the mosaic constitution were intended to point out a moral obligation or to prefigure the messiah or something in the christian dispensation there that moral intention or prophetic prefiguration is the one true sense of the text etc see the doctors answer at length in p xxxv  here he plainly allows of a direct application in some cases to the antitype which he calls the one true sense of the text  but how as a reasonable man he can possibly avoid acknowledging the necessary consequence of this his concession i leave all candid readers to judge for if there is an allegorical sense alluding to the antitype which he calls a moral intention or prophetic prefiguration there must certainly be likewise a literal sense applicable to the type itself  indeed the doctor has in that place refined his argument to so small a thread that it becomes almost imperceptible  the next objection quoted by dr benson is as follows  object iv are not many passages in the new testament taken from the old testament and used in a quite different sense from what they have as they stand in the original writer and must not these be called double senses of the words of sacred scripture  to this the doctor answers  it is acknowledged that our lord and his apostles and evangelists have taken several passages from the old testament and used them in a very different sense from what they have as connected with the place from whence they were taken  but that will not prove a double sense of the words i may quote a passage from homer or virgil herodotus or livy to express my present meaning and in quite another sense from what it has in those ancient authors but that will not prove that those ancient authors intended their words should be understood in two senses in the original intention they had only one meaning in my accommodation of them they have only one meaning and though the same words may have different ideas affixed to them and be used by successive speakers or writers in various senses yet that does not prove that in the original intention they had more than one signification  now i readily allow that dr bensons idea of an accommodation is certainly true in such cases as he has supposed viz in quotations from homer or virgil etc to express a present meaning in quite another sense from what it has in those ancient authors and i as readily assent to a part of dr w  ms quotation in page    of his critical dissertation from a very learned author dr gregory sharp  see his second argument in defense of christianity taken from the ancient prophecies page      the sentence which immediately follows the above extract ought by no means to be omitted when the authors sentiments on this head are quoted viz  but indeed to an attentive mind the difference will appear very great between the citations from profane authors and the prophets   viz that when passages in the grecian poets are cited or alluded to in the writings of the new or old testament the same are not to be considered as prophecies for indeed they cannot otherwise be esteemed than as a mere accommodation of phrases  but when the word of the lord by his prophets or as st matthew warily expresses himself that which was spoken of the lord by the prophet is cited by an evangelist and declared to be fulfilled the idea of a mere accommodation becomes highly improper not only in a grammatical but also in a religious sense  therefore in answer to all that has been said in favor of accommodations i must observe that the fulfilling of proverbs and phrases or of quotations from poets and historians by a similarity of circumstances is so widely different from the fulfilling of a prophecy that the true meaning of the word fulfill when applied to the latter cannot justly be ascertained by such a comparison  the word of a prophet especially the word of the lord by a prophet implies a foretelling or promise of future things which must in due time be fulfilled as all things must be fulfilled said our lord which were written in the law of moses and in the prophets and in the psalms concerning me luke xxiv     therefore when we are told that the word which was spoken of the lord by the prophet is fulfilled we cannot either with grammatical or religious propriety as i have before observed understand any other fulfilling or accomplishment than that which was originally intended by the holy spirit to be prefigured  because we cannot allow that a scripture prophecy is accommodated to a particular sense to which it originally had no reference see page  0 crit dissert  unless we allow likewise that such an accommodation is absolutely a perversion of the primary sense of the prophet for readers would not only be thereby perplexed and misled with respect to the true accomplishment originally and singly intended by the words of the prophet so cited but would also be naturally led to conceive that the matters related by the evangelist were intentionally prefigured or foretold thereby which would be a deception of no small discredit to the evangelist if his comparison had really no other relation to the prophecy than that of a similiarity of circumstances  so that such a misapplication of scripture prophecy cannot otherwise be considered than as a deception leading to a double misconstruction as above which would be as little suitable to the testimony of an evangelist by way of illustration as to the original sense of the prophet whatever dr benson may think of it or dr w  ms either see his remarks p  0  if all this be duly considered i think no one can reasonably suppose that an evangelist would attempt to mislead his readers by declaring a prophecy to be accomplished or fulfilled in a particular sense to which it originally had no reference see critical dissert p  0  dr benson in page xxii of his introduction informs us that if the iid and xvith psalms can be shown quite throughout to agree to king david then they ought to be interpreted of him but if as some judicious persons have thought there be in them some expressions which are not applicable to king david then they should be interpreted wholly concerning the messiah to whom they do in every part very well agree  now i am of the same opinion with dr benson that these two psalms are undoubtedly to be interpreted of the messiah and i do not at all contend for the application of them to david  i only object therefore to the doctors rule of interpretation which he has applied to the said psalms because i think it will be liable in a great variety of applications to mislead and perplex those persons who may happen to adopt it  for instance the lxxiid psalm of which he speaks in the same page is undoubtedly a prophecy of christs kingdom as dr benson interprets it yet his rule seems to lead him into a real difficulty concerning it because he is thereby obliged to deny the least reference to king solomon when it plainly appears by the title of the psalm  to solomon that the psalmist absolutely addressed himself to solomon who in the beginning of his reign was manifestly a type of the spiritual solomon or shiloh  or  the prince of peace  isaiah ix   indeed the doctors rule can by no means be admitted if we consider the nature and general style of prophetical writings and the abrupt transitions frequently found therein of which i have given ample and undeniable proofs from the viith viiith and ixth chapters of isaiah see the second part of my remarks on the critical dissertation  these passages and many others of the same kind very much confirm what i have wrote part ii p    concerning the passage quoted by st matthew from hosea viz out of egypt have i called my son and i think must prove to all considerate people that dr sykes the other champion for accommodations to whom dr w  ms has referred me has been much too precipitate in declaring pages   0 and     of his connection of natural and revealed religion that the prophet in this text is not speaking of any future event and that the term fulfilled cannot imply a prophecy of our saviors going into egypt or coming from thence etc  the same observation may with justice be made concerning dr w  ms who boldly asks page  0  how can it be said that any thing is fulfilled which was not spoken to be fulfilled as in chap ii    matthew or not spoken by a prophet in the sense in which it is cited by an evangelist also the doctor declares in page     concerning this passage that it could not be fulfilled when the child jesus came out of egypt  in answer to these assertions i must observe in the first place that they cannot by any means be proved and secondly that it is most reasonable to believe this text of hosea to be a prophecy of christ because the style and construction of the sentence itself is so peculiarly adapted to the single person of the messiah that the seventy have thought themselves obliged to leave the literal sense of the original in order to render it more suitable in their translation to the people of israel all which i have before particularly noted  but there are still other reasons to be given in favor of it  though the people of israel are here spoken of in such a manner that dr w  ms thinks he has sufficient reason to entitle it a declaration of an event long past yet st matthew expressly quotes it as a prophecy viz as that which was spoken of the lord by the prophet which expression could not with any propriety be used if the words of the prophet were merely an historical relation for they could not in that case be said to be spoken of the lord  thus it plainly appears that there is not the least room to suppose an accommodation  so that notwithstanding all that has been said by dr sykes dr g benson and dr w  ms against double senses it must unavoidably be allowed that the declaration in this place of an event long past prefigured an event to come and consequently that this single text affords an indisputable proof of the subsistence of double senses in the scriptures  though some christians have run into errors by turning every thing into allegory double senses parables and types whether they were really so or not yet this is no just argument why we should indiscriminately reject all constructions of this kind  and though i contend for double senses in some cases yet i am as averse to an unnecessary multiplication of them as dr w  ms can be and therefore reject and protest against the doctors proposition in page of his ms reply to my remarks that if a prophecy has two senses it may have two hundred and all of them equally just  the fulfilling of a prophecy as i have before observed must mean the only true accomplishment or completion of it so that it cannot justly be extended or applied to any further circumstances than those particularly and originally intended therefore when an evangelist has declared a prophecy to be fulfilled though he may have convinced us that the prophets words referred to are capable of bearing a double sense viz one literal and one allegorical or prefigurative which he himself points out yet at the same time he manifestly excludes the other     senses notwithstanding that dr w  ms thinks all of them equally just for after a declaration is made of indisputable authority that a prophecy is fulfilled it would be not only impertinent but presumptuous to look for a further accomplishment  it is necessary however for me to observe that the fulfilling of some particular prophecies includes a considerable length of time as well as a variety of circumstances and places  of this i propose to give one remarkable instance which will afford me at the same time a proper opportunity of speaking more particularly to dr sykes  the doctor in his connection of natural and revealed religion chap x p     affirms that our savior and his apostles applied the term to fulfill when there was only a similitude of circumstances and that they cited the words of the old testament and made use of that term upon the application of them where they did not design to express the accomplishment of a prophecy you have says the doctor an instance very clear in matthew xiii       where our savior gives the reason why he spoke to the people in parables because says he they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of esaias which says by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive for this peoples heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their hearts and should be converted and i should heal them  our savior says the doctor applies these words to the jews in judea and st paul many years afterward applies the very same prophecy to the jews at rome this shows continues he that though the term fulfill when applied to an event foretold does signify the accomplishment of a real prophecy yet it was used in cases where there was no accomplishment of a prediction but only a similitude of circumstances and consequently the application of the words of a prophet to a certain particular event by wih they are said to be fulfilled does not  a double sense of prophecy or that such a particular event was foretold but the real meaning of the word must be determined by other circumstances such as whether the prophet is speaking of a future event or not or in short by those means by which one knows whether the words are prophetic or not  but before all this reasoning of dr sykes be admitted we ought carefully to examine the foundation or proof on which it is built  this he calls an instance very clear but i hope to convince my readers that it is no instance at all of this matter and consequently that the doctors conclusion thereupon is unjust  were not the jews one people and descended from the same stock whether they lived at jerusalem or rome  if this be granted and i think the most zealous advocates for dr sykes will not deny it it must necessarily be allowed likewise that this remarkable prophecy of esaias concerning them viz by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand etc isaiah vi  0 was manifestly fulfilled when the jews rejected the doctrine of christ whether preached by himself at one time or by his apostles at other different times  so i think i may safely conclude that the two different applications quoted by dr sykes of this same prophecy were not occasioned as he supposes by a mere similitude of circumstances but by a direct accomplishment of the prediction in both cases  now as this example cannot any longer serve the cause in favor of which it was quoted by dr sykes i hope it will not be esteemed an improper example of a very different argument and therefore i shall beg leave to claim it on my side of the question as an instance very clear of the truth of the observation which i made above viz that the fulfilling of some particular prophecies includes a considerable length of time as well as a variety of circumstances and places  however i must not leave this text without coming to a further explanation with dr w  ms concerning it because he has brought a very heavy accusation against me concerning the parallel account given by st mark chap iv        he charges me with reflecting severely on the character of the blessed jesus by saying that he taught in parables lest they should understand and be saved our savior says the doctor gave a very different reason for his conduct and mr s  should have rendered the passage mark iv    agreeable to the evangelists words in the   d verse of the same chapter  should be there translated if peradventure as it is in  d timothy ii     however i am not at all conscious i thank god of having in the least respect offended against the character of our blessed lord  neither do i know of any severe reflection in this case except the doctors own charge against myself  whatever sense the word  may bear in other places yet in the parallel places of st matthew and mark abovementioned it must necessarily be construed lest  or to that effect for as the sense of the context must confirm the true meaning of any particular word it will be found upon examination that the doctors sense of these passages cannot possibly be admitted  the words of christ according to the testimony of both these evangelists point out the material distinction which he then made between those that were true believers and the reprobate jews whom our lord called them that are without see mark iv    to the former it was given to know the mystery of the kingdom of god matthew xiii    mark iv    but to the latter says st matthew it is not given  now this necessary distinction is entirely lost by dr w  mss interpretation because there is no such distinction made in the   d verse of the fourth chapter of st mark the sense of which the doctor proposes to adopt for the evangelist is there speaking of christs preaching in general to the whole multitude including those to whom it was given to know as well as those to whom it was not given and this is certain because in the very next verse the   th we read that afterward when they were alone he expounded all things to his disciples  now it might very well be said of christs preaching to the whole multitude of good and bad together that with many such parables spoke he the word unto them as they were able to hear it because christ observed this same method even when he taught his disciples alone and at last declared to them soon before his passion i have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them now john xvi     but when the reprobate jews are spoken of separately and distinctly from those to whom it was given to know it cannot be understood that the word was spoken unto them as they were able to hear it  because it is apparent that they were never able to hear it or bear it  according to the true sense of these phrases which imply such a comprehension of the doctrine as may produce an assent or belief otherwise the prophecy of isaiah which christ then referred to could not have been fulfilled because seeing they see not said our lord and hearing they hear not neither do they understand which is very different from being spoken to as dr w  ms would have it as they were able to hear and in them continued our lord is fulfilled the prophecy of esaias which says by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive therefore it is plain that st marks expression chap iv    cannot be applied to these when distinctly spoken of from the rest of the congregation for this peoples heart said isaiah is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and i should heal them said our lord the closing of their eyes was their own act and deed their eyes they have closed lest they should see etc so that there was no partiality for the reason why these mysteries are no more plainly delivered unto them the jews is for their foregoing obstinacy see assemblys annot on the said text  dr hammond paraphrases the   th verse to the same effect viz that this is a just judgment of gods upon them for their obduration and obstinacy etc  mons martin likewise explains this to the same purpose cest a dire que dieu se cache a ceux qui layant pu trouver ne se sont pas mis en etat de le chercher and quil livre a leurs prejuges and a leur tenebres ceux qui ont ferme les yeux a la verite   in their condemnation they having rendered themselves unworthy of a clearer revelation by their unwillingness to be converted they rejected such evidence as christ was pleased to give them which would have been amply sufficient had they not not wilfully shut their eyes against it for st john says chap iii    this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their works are evil  therefore they were justly esteemed unworthy to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven for whosoever has said our lord to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever has not from him shall be taken away even that he has therefore  speak i to them in parables because they seeing see not etc  the words  therefore plainly refer to the foregoing sentence viz but whosoever has not  from him shall be taken away etc so that the scope and tenor of the argument would be entirely destroyed if dr w  mss sense of the parallel passage in st mark were to be admitted  for christ plainly intended to show that the unbelieving jews would lose even what little knowledge they had so far would they be from understanding or receiving his parables and the event plainly proved this for they fell from bad to worse until the total destruction of jerusalem when the abomination of desolation spoken of by daniel was accomplished  st mark does not indeed express the very words of the prophet isaiah nor mention the quotation made of them by christ but he plainly delivers the full sense of them as they were really fulfilled in the unbelieving jews viz  unto you said christ to his disciples it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of god but unto them that are without all these things are done in parables that seeing they may see and not perceive and hearing they may hear and not understand lest at any time they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven them  the particle  that followed by verbs in the subjunctive mood  etc cannot possibly be made sense of if the word  lest is translated  if peradventure because the negative  viz  and  may not see and may not understand absolutely leads to a different sense from that proposed by dr w  ms  so that it is most reasonable to conclude with dr hammond that these words  that seeing etc note the obduration of the israelites which fell on them from gods desertion as a punishment of their not making use of the talents which he had given them and so this verse is answerable and parallel to matthew xiii    or the end of that place in isaiah recited and set down at large in st matthew but here  and so also in luke viii  0 and john xii  0 epitomized and summed up  lest they should see etc  the word  therefore cannot in either of these places be construed if peradventure without destroying the propriety of our lords quotation from isaiah delivered at length by st matthew and epitomized by st mark as above for the word  in the original prophecy is properly rendered  in the syriac and lest in the english translations and cannot possibly bear any other sense agreeable to the context because the prophet plainly foretold that the jews would wilfully shut their eyes  lest they should see with their eyes  now men do not usually shut their eyes in order to see therewith or according to dr w  mss interpretation of  if peradventure they may see with their eyes but rather that they may not see or according to the propriety of the english translation of  lest they should see with their eyes etc  the closing of the eyes in this place is indeed a mere figurative expression for the insensibility and wicked obstinacy of the jews yet the same reasoning holds good notwithstanding this consideration and sufficiently proves that the word  must be construed negatively and not as dr w  ms proposes if peradventure  by this example we learn that some parables were not only difficult to those reprobate unbelievers whom st mark calls them that are without but also even to the true disciples themselves who by misunderstanding the parable of the sower and by desiring an explanation of it see  0th verse occasioned this remarkable answer of our lord the purport of which is recorded in the two texts considered above  nevertheless there were very many cases wherein the teaching by parables and types was not only the safest and most prudent but also the shortest and clearest method of conveying a true idea of the proposed doctrine as being very suitable to the genius and customs of the eastern nations in general and of the jews in particular and also because the types and figures themselves would make a very deep impression on the memory and by their well known characters clearly illustrate the allegorical meaning  i propose now to reconsider the principal subject of my remarks viz the prophecy of isaiah concerning the birth of immanuel  dr w  ms has asserted page    that the evangelist only alludes to the passage in isaiah because it was remarkably suitable to the matter which he was relating  this occasioned my question to the doctor viz if  does not signify a virgin in what sense can the text be esteemed remarkably suitable to the miraculous conception of a virgin by the holy ghost and in what manner could the accommodation of it to that singular event assist the sacred historian as he supposes by way of illustration see part i page     i afterward observe that the doctor has taken great pains to make the text remarkably unsuitable by insinuating that  the young woman as he construes it spoken of in the text was so far from being a virgin that she was with child even at the time when she was pointed at as he devises in p    by the prophet  to which the doctor replies had st matthew alluded to the birth of this child it would have been very unsuitable  now this concession is sufficient for my purpose because the doctors insinuation that the evangelist alluded only to the name immanuel and not to the other circumstances related by the prophet must appear entirely groundless when we consider the words of st matthew  for though the evangelist interpreted the name immanuel yet this does not prove that he referred merely to this name but rather that no other person but the messiah himself could properly be entitled god with us and consequently that he esteemed the words of isaiah to be really a prophecy and such a one as could not be fulfilled except in christ alone who was truly god with us but farther  the evangelists manner of introducing the quotation very clearly shows that this name was not the only thing he intended to allude to  for he says  now all this was done   that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son etc  the words all this was done must refer to the relation before given concerning the miraculous conception of the virgin mary by the holy ghost and therefore the prophecy of isaiah that a virgin should conceive and bear a son was suitable not in the name only as doctor w  ms has insinuated but in the whole quotation  another objection is made that the birth of a child from a virgin is a fact of such a nature as not to admit of proof it is a fact says the doctor which in the very nature of it cannot be a sign to any person but the mother  nevertheless the scriptures inform us that this sign was clearly proved i e the wonderful event that a virgin had conceived was known with absolute certainty even before the birth of the messiah and this not merely by the testimony of the mother but by other very sufficient authorities which rendered the sign as apparent and indubitable as any other sign that was ever given even the most selfevident  for after the angel gabriel had revealed to the virgin mary that she although a virgin should conceive and bring forth a son st luke i    the same thing was confirmed to her by her cousin elizabeth in the hill country of judea  blessed is she that believed said elizabeth filled with the holy ghost for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord luke i     see the whole salutation and the testimony of john the baptist though himself at that time only a babe in the womb which clearly proves that the absolute knowledge of the fact was not confined to the virgin mother alone  afterward an angel was sent from god to prevent joseph from putting away his espoused wife on account of her being with child and the angel informed him before the time that she should bring forth a son and that he might the more effectually convince him of his wifes purity and virtue he assured him saying that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost matt i  0  therefore though the birth of a child from a virgin is by dr w  ms esteemed a fact of such a nature as not to admit of proof yet nothing is impossible with god who was pleased to give these indubitable proofs of the long promised sign even whilst the child jesus was in the womb which must entirely obviate the doctors objection that this cannot be a sign to any person but the mother  in the fullness of time the sign was manifested in the most extraordinary manner  an angel accompanied with a multitude of the heavenly host proclaimed the wonderful birth to the shepherds in the field and a star pointed out to the eastern strangers the place where the young child lay  undoubtedly this wonderful circumstance that a virgin had brought forth a son would in a little time be as well known to the house of david as these miraculous manifestations and confirmations of the said supernatural birth especially as the family of joseph the blessed virgins husband was the chief branch of that royal stock lineally descended from zorobabel and so from the son of jesse  there is still another difficulty with dr w  ms i cannot perceive says he what event the birth of immanuel could be a sign of unless it could be a sign of itself  but is it really possible that dr w  ms cannot perceive that the miraculous birth of the true immanuel was a sign of something more than that event itself  was it not a sign to all those who then waited for the consolation and redemption of israel luke ii    that the kingdom of god was nigh at hand matthew xii   but if i cast out devils by the spirit of god then the kingdom of god is come unto you luke x     and say unto them the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you  notwithstanding be ye sure of this that the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you   was it not a sign to joseph and others of the house of david that a child so born must be the long promised messiah of the seed of david to whom the kingdom was to be restored and in whom according to isaiahs promise to his cotemporaries of the house of david it was to be established for ever see isaiah ix       samuel vii     but i find it is in vain that i urge to dr w  ms the accomplishment of the several prophecies concerning the establishment of the kingdom of david in christ for the doctor still seems to persist in his former notion that nathaniel labored under a mistake in calling christ king of israel  he hopes to evade the point by alleging that not only nathaniel and the disciples but the whole jewish nation did actually labor under a great mistake about the nature of the messiahs kingdom  thus he would lead me to a very different question but i am aware that though the disciples did for some time labor under a mistake as the doctor observes concerning the nature of the messiahs kingdom yet there was not the least mistake in those who truly believed concerning the main point in question viz whether or not the messiah was really a king  notwithstanding that our lord rejected all the temporal authority of a worldly king and declared that his kingdom was not of this world he was nevertheless really a king king of israel as nathaniel called him and king of judah or which is the same thing king of the jews for even pilate himself seemed convinced of christs just right to the title of king though like a thoroughpaced time server he preferred his own temporal interest to all other considerations and delivered up the king of kings rev xvii    to be slain knowing him to be a king for his answer to the chief priests concerning the title intended to be affixed to the cross plainly shows that he was conscious of this  dr w  ms charges me with having brought a vast number of texts to prove not my assertion that jesus was ever called the king of judah but the truth of his assertion etc concerning the mistake of nathaniel and he says this will be evident to every one who consults the passages cited by me  but if the doctor will please once more to consult the passages himself he will find that several among them are prophecies which were absolutely fulfilled in our lord jesus  therefore i hope he will not venture to assert that the prophets likewise labored under a mistake when they proclaimed these titles of the glorious messiah or that the disciples and all other christians even to this day still labor under a mistake in applying them to christ in whom alone they were or could be fulfilled  rejoice greatly o daughter of zion shout o daughter of jerusalem behold thy king comes unto thee the prophet then proceeds to describe this coming of the king of zion and jerusalem so as exactly to correspond with the evangelists account luke xix       of christs public entry into jerusalem when the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen saying blessed be the king that comes in the name of the lord etc for he was certainly a king even when he rode upon the ass which is proved by the continuation of zechariahs prophecy ix   whereby he points out the character and appearance of the king of zion and jerusalem mentioned in the beginning of the same verse he is just said the prophet and having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass and upon a colt the foal of an ass  so the prophet micah declared that out of bethlehem ephratah should he come forth that is to be ruler in israel whose goings forth have been from of old from everlasting chap v    the event proved the truth of the prophets words as well as of the evangelists citation matt ii   and   for the holy one that was born at bethlehem was afterward undoubtedly ruler in israel before the dissolution of that people from an united nation of which besides the power of his teaching and his mighty works his public entry into jerusalem and the authority shown by him in clearing the temple are remarkable proofs  that christ was a ruler in israel is implied in the preceding words of the same prophet micah v   they shall smite the judge of israel with a rod upon the cheek a ruler and a judge are synonymous terms and it is certain that christ pronounced judgment against israel for their impenitence and want of faith  condemning them with respect to their temporal estate to a horrid destruction and desolation st matthew chap xxiv  and as all this was most punctually fulfilled see josephuss account of the jewish war upon them it is certain likewise that the same judge of israel whom they smote upon the cheek will one day judge them also in their eternal state as well as all their unhappy descendants who persist in the same unbelief  if these prophecies were really fulfilled in jesus they most certainly prove that the messiah was as he ever will be a king and consequently that his disciples were not mistaken in calling him so howsoever they might misunderstand the nature of his kingdom  therefore the doctors reply upon this point cannot well be esteemed a proof of any thing more than of his own great unwillingness to acknowledge that he himself instead of nathaniel labors under a mistake  another remarkable excuse which the doctor has offered in behalf of his hypothesis deserves particular notice  in answer to my remarks on canticles vi   concerning the particular distinction there made of virgins from queens and concubines the doctor replies that hebrew poetry is not so well understood as to enable me to determine that  in canticles vi   is not used in stead of  for the sake of meter  this unexpected turn of thought may perhaps be esteemed ingenious but it is far from satisfactory for if critics were allowed to substitute the sense of one word for another whenever their arguments are reduced to that necessity it would be but a vain task to dispute with them and a confusion of language like that of the builders of babel must necessarily succeed their perversion of words  in english poetry the doctor may produce as many instances of such substitutions as he pleases and he may rest assured that i shall never think it worth my while to attempt a confutation of them  but when such refined criticisms are applied to any part of holy scripture i think they ought not by any means to be admitted unless the authors of them shall be able to prove that it is more justifiable to adapt the scriptures to our own private opinions than our opinions to the scriptures  the end of part v index of texts referred to in the foregoing work index genesis chap ver part pages iii    i
