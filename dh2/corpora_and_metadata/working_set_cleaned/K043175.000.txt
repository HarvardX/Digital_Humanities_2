strait the gallant leader with open arms received him  knew him for thy son in secret knew him nor revealed he aught that touched his birth  but still the busy voice of fame increasing as she goes through all the ranks babbled abroad each circumstance  by thee how he was privately conveyed  sent forth a tender infant to be reared in solitude a stranger to himself  the warriors saw with what a graceful port he moved in arms an early hero  deemed him far above the common lot of life  deemed him zaphimri and all with reverential awe beheld him this this my zamti reached the tyrants ear and

memories and teach mankind however oppression stalk the groaning earth yet heaven in its own hour can bring relief can blast the tyrant in his guilty pride and prove the orphans guardian to the last  finis to m de voltaire sir a letter to you from an english author will carry with it the appearance of corresponding with the enemy not only as the two nations are at present involved in a difficult and important war but also because in many of your late writings you seem determined to live in a state of hostility with the british nation whenever we come in your way we are ferocious we are islanders we are the people whom your country has taught we fall behind other nations in point of taste and elegance of composition the same cause that has witheld from us a genius for painting and music has also deprived us of the true spirit of tragedy and in short barbarism still prevails among us  but notwithstanding this vein of prejudice which has discolored almost all your fugitivepieces there still breathes throughout your writings such a general spirit of humanity and zeal for the honor of the republic of letters that i am inclined to imagine the author of the english orphan of china an obscure islander may still address you upon terms of amity and literary benevolence  as i have attempted a tragedy upon a subject that has exercised your excellent talents and thus have dared to try my strength in the bow of ulysses i hold myself in some fort accountable to m devoltaire for the departure i have made from his plan and the substitution of a new fable of my own  my first propensity to this story was occasioned by the remarks of an admirable critic mr hurd in his commentary upon horace of our own upon the orphan of the house of chau preserved to us by the industrious and sensible p du halde which as our learned commentator observes amidst great wildness and irregularity has still some traces of resemblance to the beautiful models of antiquity in my reflections upon this piece i imagined i saw a blemish in the manner of saving the orphan by the tame resignation of another infant in his place especially when the subject afforded so fair an opportunity of touching the strugglings of a parent on so trying an occasion it therefore occurred to me if a fable could be framed in which the father and the two young men might be interwoven with probability and perspicuity and not embarrassed with all the perplexities of a riddle as you know is the case of the heraclius of corneille that then many situations might arise in which some of the nearest affections of the heart might be awakened but even then i was too conscious that it must be executed by a genius very different from myself  in this state of mind sir i heard with pleasure that m de voltaire had produced at paris his lorphelin de la chine i ardently longed for a perusal of the piece expecting that such a writer would certainly seize all the striking incidents which might naturally grow out of so pregnant a story and that he would leave no source of passion unopened i was in some sort but not wholly disappointed i saw m de voltaire rushing into the midst of things at once opening his subject in an alarming manner and after the narrative relating to gengiskan is over working up his first act like a poet indeed  meum qui pectus inaniter angit ut magus  in the beginning of the second act he again touches the passions with a masterhand but like a rower who has put forth all his strength and suddenly slackens his exertion i saw or imagined i saw him give way all at once the great tumult of the passions is over the interest wears away gengiskan talks politics the tenderness of a mother flying with all the strong impulses of nature to the relief of her child is thrown into cold unimpassioned narrative the role pour pamoureux must have its place and the rough conqueror of a whole people must instantly become le chevalier gengiskan as errant a lover as ever sighed in the thuilleries at paris your own words sir strongly expressive of that manly and sensible taste which distinguishes you throughout europe occurred to me upon this occasion quelle place pour la galanterie que le parricide and linceste qui desolent une famille and la contagion qui ravage un pais et quel exemple plus frapant du ridicule de notre theater and du pouvoir de lhabitude que corneille dun cote qui fait dire a thesee   quelque ravage affreux quetale ici la peste  labsence aux vrais amans est encore plus funeste et moi qui soixante ans apres lui viens fair parler une vielle jocaste dun viel amor and tout cela pour complaire au gout le plus fade and le plus faux qui ait jamais corrompu la literature indeed sir gengiskan in the very moment of overwhelming a whole nation usurping a crown and massacring the royal family except one infant whom he is in quest of appeared to me exactly like the amorous oedipus in the midst of a destructive plague nunc non erat his locus  how would that noble performance that chef doeuvre of your country the athalie of racine have been defaced by the gallantry of an intrigue if a tyrant had been introduced to make love to the wise of the high priest or if joad entertaining a secret affection for athalie and being asked what orders he would give relating to the delivery of his country should answer aucune none at all  and yet this is the language of a northern conqueror whining for a mandarins wife who has no power of resisting and having no relation to the royal family could not by an intermarriage strengthen his interest in the crown but to you sir who have told us that love should reign a very tyrant in tragedy or not appear there at all being unfit for the second place to you who have said that nero should not hide himself behind a tapestry to overhear the conversation of his mistress and his rival what need i urge these remarks  to fill up the long career of a tragedy with this episodic love must certainly have been the motive that led you into this error an error i take the liberty to call it because i have observed it to be the hackneyed and stale stratagem of many modern writers within the compass of my reading there is hardly a bad man in any play but he is in love with some very good woman the scenes that pass between them i have always remarked are found dull and unawakening by the audience even though adorned with all the graces of such composition as yours of which it is but justice to say that it bestows embellishments upon every subject  for me sir who only draw in crayons who have no resource to those lasting colors of imagination with which you set off every thing a writer such as i am sir could not presume to support that duplicity of passion which runs through your piece i could not pretend by the powers of style to suborn an audience in favor of those secondary passages from which their attention naturally revolts a plainer and more simple method lay before me i was necessitated to keep the main object as much as possible before the eye and therefore it was that i took a survey of my subject in order to catch at every thing that seemed to me to result with order and propriety from it a scantiness of interesting business seemed to me a primary defect in the construction of the french orphan of china and that i imagined had its source in the early date of your play by beginning almost gemino ab ovo by making the orphan and the mandarines son children in their cradles it appeared to me that you had stripped yourself of two characters which might be produced in an amiable light so as to engage the affections of their auditors not only for themselves but consequently for those also to whom they should stand in any degree of relation from this conduct i proposed a further advantage that of taking off the very obvious resemblance to the andromache which now strikes every body in your plan this last remark i do not urge against accidental and distant coincidencies of sentiment diction or fable many of the greek plays we know had a familylikeness such as an oedipus an electra an iphigenia in tauris in aulis a merope etc but what is a beauty in racine seems in his great successor to be a blemish in the former nothing depends on the life of astyanax but what was very natural the happiness of the mother in the latter the fate of a kingdom is grafted upon the fortunes of an infant and i ask your own feelings for no body knows the human heart better whether an audience is likely to take any considerable interest in the destiny of a babe who when your zamti has saved him cannot produce any change any revolution in the affairs of china no sir the conquered remain in the same abject state of vassalage and the preservation of the infant king becomes therefore uninteresting and unimportant he might die sir in cutting his teeth of the hooping cough or any of the disorders attendant on that tender age whereas when the orphan is grown up to maturity when he is a moral agent in the piece when a plan is laid for revenging himself on the destroyers of his family it then becomes a more pressing motive in the mandarines mind nay it is almost his duty in such a case to sacrifice even his own offspring for the good of his country in your story sir give me leave to say i do not see what end can be answered by zamtis loyalty his prospect is at least so distant that it becomes almost chimerical and therefore as history warrants an expulsion of the tartars as it was not upon the first inroad but in process of time and experience that they learned to incorporate themselves with the conquered i had recourse to my own preconceived notions whether i was partially attached to them or whether my reasonings upon your fable were just you sir and the public will determine  you will perceive sir in the english orphan some occasional insertions of sentiment from your elegant performance to use the expression of the late mr dryden when he talks of ben johnsons imitation of the ancients you will often track me in your snow for this i shall make no apology either to the public or you none to the public because they have applauded some strokes for which i am indebted to you and none certainly to you because you are well aware i have but followed the example of many admired writers boileau corneille and racine with you and in england milton mr addison and mr pope it was finely said by you i have read the story and take it upon trust when it was objected to the celebrated abbe metastasio as a reproach that he had frequent transfusions of thought from your writings ah le cher volcur il ma bien embelli this talent of embellishing i do not pretend to to avail myself of my reading and to improve my own productions is all i can pretend to and that i flatter myself i have done not only from you but many of the writers of antiquity if the authorities i have abovementioned were not sufficient i could add another very bright example the example of m de voltaire whom i have often tracked to use the same expression again in the snow of shakespeare the snow of shakespeare is but a cold expression but perhaps it will be more agreeable to you than a word of greater energy that should convey a full idea of the astonishing powers of that great man for we islanders have remarked of late that m devoltaire has a particular satisfaction in descanting on the faults of the most wonderful genius that ever existed since homer insomuch that a very ingenious gentleman of my acquaintance tells me that whenever you treat the english bard as a drunken savage in your avaunt propos he always deems it a sure prognostic that your play is the better for him  if the great scenes of shakespeare sir if his boundless view of all nature the lawn the wilderness the blasted heath mountains and craggy rocks with thunder and lightening on their brows if these cannot strike the imagination of m de voltaire how can i expect that the studied regularity of my little shrubbery should afford him any kind of pleasure to drop the metaphor if the following tragedy does not appear to you a monstrous farce it is all i can reasonably expect but whatever may be your opinion of it i must beg that you will not make it the criterion by which you would decide concerning the taste of the english nation or the present state of literature among us what you have humbly said of yourself in order to do honor to your nation i can assert with truth of the author of the english orphan that he is one of the worst poets now in this country it is true indeed that the play has been received with uncommon applause that so elegant a writer as the author of creusa and the roman father was my critic and my friend and that a great deal of very particular honor has been done me by many persons of the first distinction but give me leave to say they all know the faults of the piece as well as if it had been discussed by the academy of belles lettres  we are a generous nation sir and the faintest approaches to merit always meet here the warmest encouragement one thing further i will assure you in case you should discover any traces of barbarism in the style or fable that if you had been present at the representation you would have seen a theatrical splendour conducted with a bienscance unknown to the scene francoise the performance of the two young men would have made you regret that they were not in your piece and though a weak state of health deprived the play of so fine an actress as mrs cibber you would have beheld in mandane a figure that would be an ornament to any stage in europe and you would have acknowleged that her acting promises also to be the same moreover you would have seen a zamti whose exquisite powers are capable of adding pathos and harmony even to our great shakespeare and have already been the chief support of some of your scenes upon the english stage  upon the whole sir
