constance hastily meeting lisette constance lisette lisette who do you think i have just seen   lis your old guardian i suppose   con do you think i should look thus pleasant if it was he i meant   lis who then our jailor who keeps the keys   con what poor jeffrey ha ha ha  how you talk   lis no no i guess who you mean the young marquis de lancy and he has passed so frequently under your window within these few days that i am amazed your guardian with all his suspicions has not observed him   con he has walked by above ten times within this hour and every time with his eyes fixed up to the lattice of my window and i had no heart to remove from it for every time he saluted me with the most respectful bow   lis was his valet with him   con no but i saw another person in deep conversation with him a strange looking man who appeared like one of the faculty for his dress very much resembled that of my guardians   lis who would it be   con but what most surprised me he had a letter in his hand which he respectfully held up to me but i could not reach it   lis i know who it is  la fluer valet to the marquis disguised as a doctor and i have no doubt but under that disguise he will find means to introduce himself to your old guardian and perhaps be brought into the very house and if i can assist his scheme i will for is it not a shame the doctor should dare here in paris to forbid both you and your servant to stir from home lock us up and treat us as women are treated in spain  with anger con never mind lisette dont put yourself in a passion for we can learn to plot and deceive and treat him as men are treated in spain   lis right madam and to prove i am not less inclined than yourself to spanish manners i am as much in love as you are   con not with the marquis   lis do you think i dont know better where it is my duty to love i am in love with his man    con i wish i knew the contents of that letter he held out to me   lis that you are beloved  admired i can tell every word in it  i know every sentence as well as if i had read it  and now madam it is my advice you sit down and answer it directly   con before i have read it   lis yes yes give your answer at the time you receive his letter  consider how convenient it will be to give the one while you take the other  we are so watched you know that we ought to let no opportunity pass for fear we should never get another and therefore when he finds means to send his letter you must take the same to return yours   con but if my guardian should even know i had written to a gentleman   lis i will write for you  and should there be any discovery the letter will be in my hand writing not yours  we must lose no time  the doctor is abroad at present and it must be both written and delivered before his return  she sits at the table and begins to write con but my dear lisette    lis dont put me out   con what are you saying   lis writing what you are thinking   con you dont know my thoughts   lis i do  and here they are in this letter   con let me look at it   lis no dont examine your thoughts i beg you will not solds the letter and rises besides you have no time to read it i must run to the garden gate and deliver it immediately  the worst difficulty is having for near an hour to supplicate this poor simple decrepitd fool of the old doctors to open me the garden gate for a moment  jeffrey calls con the doctor has lately appointed jeffrey his apothecary  he is busy preparing of medicines and will be angry at being disturbed   lis no matter  it may save the life of some of his masters patients  enter jeffrey a bandage on his left eye and one on his right leg jef you made me overthrow the whole decoction   lis great apothecary   con and alone worthy the physician under whom you have received instructions   jef i am very sorry i overthrew the decoction for it was for my use  my leg is in pain still and i am not yet satisfied the dog was not mad   lis i tell you i am sure he was not and had you suffered him to live it would have proved so   jef my master ordered me to kill him   lis merely to make you believe he was mad and to show his skill by pretending to preserve you from the infection   jef nay dont speak against my master   lis who was it undertook to cure your eyes   jef he and thank heaven lisette i shall not suffer any more from that   lis why then do you wear a bandage   jef to hide the place where it was   lis and is it thus the doctor cured you   jef he was so kind to put my left eye out in order to save the right   con well still you are more fortunate than the god of love for he has no eyes at all    jef and i shallhave two very soon for my master has promised me to buy me one at the great manufactory which will be much handsomer than either of my other  a very handsomer glass one   lis and if the doctor will remake you thus piece by piece in time my dear jeffrey you may become a very pretty man  but you know jeffrey i love you even as you are   jef love me  that is a good joke  lisette i am afraid you want something of me you speak to me so plesantly   lis want something of you  how could such an idea enter your head   jef because when you dont want something of me you huff me and cuff me  from morning to night eh eh you look no more as you do now why if i was dying i durst hardly speak to you   lis well henceforward you shall have no reason to complain but do you know jeffrey i have a littlefavour to ask of you   jef aye i thought so    con my dear jeffrey we will make you any recompense   jef what is it you want if i can do it without offending my master i will   lis if you dont tell him he will never know it    jef but i tell him every thing  he pays me my wages for telling  and i must not take them without earning them   con if money is of such value to you here take my purse   jef no it is not money i want it is something else   lis what what then   jef looking at lisette with affection oh mrs lisette you know what i  but you always denied me   lis pshaw if i could grant it indeed without my master knowing of it   jef oh i will not tell him of that i protest   con well jeffrey what is your favor   jef just one salute of mrs lisette   lis oh if that is all after you have obliged us you shall have twenty   jef but i had rather have one now than the twenty you promise after   lis come then make haste if it must be so   jef afer saluting her oh the first kiss of the girl one loves is so sweet   lis now you are ready to comply with our request   jef tell me what it is   lis to give us the key of the garden gate   jef i am very sorry i cannot oblige you   lis why not   jef for several reasons   lis tell me one   jef in the first place i have not got the key  my master took it with him when he went out   lis you know you tell a falschood he has not got it  is this your bargain and your gratitude    jef nay if you are angry at that give me the kiss again   lis ugly foolish yet artful and cunning wretch leave the room you make love to me indeed why i always hated you laughed at you and despised you   jef i know that  did not i tell you when you spoke so kindly to me you wanted something how then could you expect me to oblige you   lis i shall ever detest the sight of you   jef unless you want something and then you will call me again  and then i shall kiss you again ha ha ha  exit showing the key lis i never was so provoked in my life   con my dear lisette if our two lovers the marquis and his servant prove no more fortunate in their schemes than we have been in ours i fear i must according to his desire marry the doctor  and you jeffrey   lis i marry jeffrey  here comes the doctor  enter doctor doc what an indignity  i cannot put up with it  i cannot bear it  i am ready to choke with passion   con dear sir what is the matter   doc i am disgraced ruined and undone   con and what has caused it sir   doc a conspiracy of the blackest kind  mans weakness is arrived to its highest summit and there is nothing wanting but merit to draw upon us the most cruel persecution   lis ah i understand  the faculty have been conspiring against you   doc they have refused to grant me a diploma  forbid me to practice as a physician and all because i dont know a parcel of insignificant words but exercise my profession according to the rules of reason and nature is it not natural to die then if a dozen or two of my patients have died under my hands is not that natural   lis very natural indeed   doc but thank heaven in spite of the scandalous reports of my enemies i have this morning nine visits to make   con very true sir a young ward has sent for you to attend his guardian  three nephews have sent for you to attend their uncles very rich men  and five husbands have sent for you in great haste to attend their wives   doc and is not that a sign they think what i can do  is it not a sign they have the highest opinion of my skill and the faculty shall see i will rise superior to their machinations  i have entered upon a project that i believe will teaze them  i have made overtures to one of their professed enemies a man whom they have crushed and who is the chief of a sect just sprung up of which perhaps you never heard for simply by the power of magnetism they can cure any ill or inspire any passion   con is it possible   doc yes  and every effect is produced upon the frame merely by the power of the magnet which is held in the hand of the physican as a wand of a conjuror is held in his and it produces wonders in physic equally surprising   con and will you become of this new sect   doc if they will recieve me  and by this time the president has i dare say recieved my letter and i wait impatiently for an answer  enter jeffry jef a doctor at the door desires to speak with you   doc a doctor in my house   lis i dare say it is the magnetizing doctor you have been writing to   doc very likely  i dare say it is doctor mystery show him in jeffry   jef please to walk this way sir  enter la fluer dressed as a doctor exit jeffry la fluer doctor i hope i have your pardon that though no farther acquaintance than by letter i thus wait upon you to pay my respects   con to lisette it it the same i saw with the marquis   lis aside and it is la fluer his valet   la fluer and to assure you that i and all my brethren have the highest respect for your talents and shall be happy to have you a member of our society   doc i presume sir you are doctor mystery author and first discoverer of that healing and sublime art animal magnetism   la fluer i am   doc and it will render you immortal  my curiosity to become acquainted with the forms and effects of your power is scarcely to be represled a moment will you indulge me with the smallest specimen of your art just to satisfy my curiosity   la fluer you are then entirely ignorant of it   doc entirely   la fluer and so am i aside hem  hem  you must know doctor    doc shall i send the women out of the room   la fluer by no means  no no but i will show both you and them a specimen of my art directly  you know doctor their is an universal fluid which spreads throughout all nature   doc a fluid   la fluer yes a fluid  which is  a  fluid  and you know doctor that this fluid  generally called a fluid is the most subtle of all that is the most subtle  do you understand me   doc yes yes    la fluer it ascends on high looking down and descends on low looking up penetrates all substances from the hardest metal to the softest bosom  you understand me i precieve   doc not very well   la fluer i will give you a simile then    doc i shall be much obliged to you   la fluer this fluid is like a river  you know what a river is   doc yes certainly   la fluer this fluid is like a river that  that  runs  that  goes  that  gently glides  so  so  so  while there is nothing to stop it  but if it encounters a mound or any other impediment  boo  boo  boo  it bursts forth  it overflows the country round  throws down villages hamlets houses trees cows and lambs but remove obstacles which obstruct its course and it begins again softly and sweetly to flow  thus  thus  thus  the fields are again adorned and every thing goes on as well as it can go on  thus it is with the animal fluid which fluid obeys the command of my art   doc surprising art but what are the means you employ   la fluer merely gestures  or a simple touch    doc astonishing give me some proof of your art directly do satisfy my curiosity   la fluer i will  and by holding this wand in which is a magnet in a particular position i will so direct the fluid that it shall immediately give you the most exeruciating rheumatism which will last you a couple of hours  i will then change it to the gout  then to strong convulsions  and after into a raging fever and in this manner shall your curiosity become satisfied  holds up his wand as if to magnetise doc hold doctor i had rather see the experiment on some one else   la fluer oh then sir i have now at my house a patient whom the faculty have just given up as incurable and notwithstanding his disorder is of a most violent and dangerous kind i will have him brought here and i will teach you to perform his cure yourself   doc by the power of magnetism   la fluer by the power of magnetism   doc that would do me infinite honor indeed  but why bring him to my house  pray who is he   la fluer a young man of quality   con dear sir let him be brought hither and let me see the cure performed   doc takes la fluer aside i cant say i approve of a young man being brought into my house  for you must know doctor  that young lady is to be my wife  as we are not exactly of an age another may make an impression   la fluer consider my patents state of health he is like a dying man   doc but he will be well after i have cured him   la fluer very true   doc wispering la fluer pray doctor is it true what they report that he who is once in possession of your art can if he pleases make every woman who comes near him in love with him   la fluer true  certainly it is   con why this wispering i am ignorant what are the virtues of your art doctor but i am sure it has not that of rendering you polite   la fluer pardon madam  i was but instructing the doctor in some particulars of which you may hereafter have reason to be satisfied   lis i doubt that sir unless your art could render this solitary confinement we are doomed to agreeable   la fluer before the end of the day you shall prefer it to all the false pleasures of the gay world for what are more false than the pleasures derived from balls masquerades and theaters   doc very true   lis well i must own i love a theater   la fluer the worst place of all to frequent  once in my life i was present at a theatrical representation but such a piece did i see ah the most dangerous for a young woman to be present at   lis eagerly crossing pray sir what was it   la fluer an honest gentleman of about  0 years age was before the audience in love with a young lady of    whom he had brought up from her infancy and whom he meant make his wife   doc very natural   la fluer a young gentleman of the neighborhood because he was young rich and handsome imagined he would suit the lady better   doc just like them all   la fluer he therefore disguifed his valet who under the mask of friendship introduced himself to this good man the guardian   doc a villain he deserved to be hanged   la fluer and seized the moment when he embraced him as i now embrace you  to stretch out his hand while it was behind him and convey a letter to the ladys waiting maid  la fluer embraces the doctor and exchanges letters with lisette lisette gives the the letter she receives to constance la fluer puts the other into his pocket lis and she gave him another  i have seen the play myself  and it was very well acted   la fluer and is it not scandalous to put such examples before young people   con and pray doctor do you think i am not under sufficient confinement that you take the same methods to make me still more unhappy   la fluer to the doctor why does your ward dislike confinement   doc because she dislikes me   la fluer are you sure of that   doc yes i think i am   con i am dying with curiosity to read my letter  aside and exit la fluer this wand shall cause in her sentiments the very reverse in this is a magnet which shall change her disposition take it gives the wand and while you keep it she will be constrained to love you with the most ardent passion   doc i thank you a thousand times  quite in rapture lis excellent  exit doc her maid has overheard us   la fluer no no but take me into another apartment and i will explain to you what at present you are not able to comprehend  after which you will permit me to step home and fetch my patient hither   doc certainly  when i am in possession of my wards affection i can have nothing to apprehend from him  and you are sure she will now become favorable to me  you are sure i shall attract her   la fluer yes sure  by the loadstone  exit end of act first act ii scene  another apartment in the doctors house enter constance and lisette lisette i overheard it all  and he has given your guardian the wand in which you heard him say the magnet was contained  and while he keeps it it is to magnetise you and force you to love him in spite of yourself   con all this agrees with the letter he has given me from his master in which the marquis informs me by what accident that letter my guardian sent to the doctor who professes magnetism fell into his hands and immediately gave him the idea of disguising his valet and sending him hither under the name of that doctor but where is la fluer now   lis just left your guardian and gone home to bring the patient you heard him speak of  and i would lay a wager that very patient is no other than the marquis himself   con but for what end is all this   lis that they have planned you may depend upon it  for the present you have nothing to do but to pretend an affection for your guardian   con it will be difficult to feign a passion my heart revolts at   lis never fear your good acting  besides i will take equal share in it    con how you    lis i will fall in love with the doctor as well as you  if the magnetism affects you  why not have the same power over me and if it makes you love him it shall make me adore him   con hush here he comes  enter doctor with the wand doc aside what he has told seems so very surprising that nothing but proofs can thoroughly convince me  and now for the proof  locks at con lis aside to constance he ogles you cast a tender look and accompany it with a sigh   con sighing alas   doc my dear constance my lovely ward  what what makes you sigh weariness of your confinement i suppose   con ah sir  fighing doc come come i confess the restraint you have been under has been too much and i am not surprised you have taken a dislike to me   con a dislike to you  ah sir  fighing oh guardian  going to speak turnsaway and hides her face dec aside i believe it will do come come constance do not sigh and make yourself uneasy you shall not live many weeks thus retired for i am thinking of marrying you very soon turns eagerly to him to a fine young gentleman  turns from him con ah cruel  near crying doc what did you say if i have the good fortune to be beloved by you let me have the happiness to hear it from yourself   con yes cruel man  some invincible power compels me in spite of my resistance  yes  i love you   lis and i adore you   doc starting what you too i did not expect that   lis no mine is not merely a love but a rage  a violence  i dote to distraction  love you to the joss of my health of spirits of rest and life   con if you do not take pity on the passion which burns in my heart  with tenderness lis if you can be regardless of the flames which consume me with violence    con can you be insensible of my tender pleadings   lis take care how you turn my affection to hatred   doc goes from between them aside what a terrible situation i have got myself into  the effects of the magnetism is very natural it acts upon one as well as another but lisettes love is very troublesome i will call jeffry in and give up part of my power to him he wall take the wand for a show minutes and charm lisette   con why do you thus run from me is this the return my love demands  but be not uneasy death shall deliver you from an object whose passion you despise  turns from him doc oh that you could but read what is written in my heart   lis ah sir behold the state kneels to which you have reduced a poor inocent if i am treated with kindness i am naturally soft gentle and tender but if i am neglected rising  by all that is great and precious i will do some strange thing either to you or my rival   doc this lisette is so furious she makes me tremble i must put an end to her affection jeffry  enter jeffry jef here sir what do you want with me   doc take this and carry it to my study  gives the wand jef yes sir  directly  crosses doc stop a moment jeffry stop a moment   jef two or three moments if you please   doc aside now we shall see what effect it has   lis to constance i see through this design let us fall in love with jeffry   con with all my heart   doc well jeffry  and  and  how do you do jeffry   jef pretty well considering my leg where the dog bit me and considering i can only see with one eye   lis but even that misforturne does not prevent your looking very agreeable jeffry   doc aside it succeeds she is taken   con who can resist that amiable figure dearest jeffry   jef ha ha ha ha ha   doc aside this is as bad as the other   jef i think the mad dog has bit us all   lis is it posible you can love jeffry no no your situation forbids it take take my master i resign him to you   con no i resign him to you   lis i will not have him   doc this is a very disagreeble situation   lis jeffry will you be deaf to my passion   con yes i am sure he will prefer me   jef no i will not i have been in love with her this twelve months and i will make choice of her   con then what will become of me   doc i can bear this no longer give that snatches the wand and do you make up some medicines   jef ah my dear lifette you have made me so happy i must shake hands  offers to take her hand she slaps his face lis learn to behave with more reserve for the future   jef ecod i think you have not behaved with much reserve did not you hang upon me and said you loved me   lis love you behold my master and do not imagine i can love any but him   con no who can love any but him   doc this is worse and worse  where is the doctor if he does not come and give me some relief i am a ruined man a loud knocking jeffry see if that is him  exit jeffry i have no doubt but it is and with him the young patient on whom i am to prove my skill constance and you lisette leave the room for the present   con yes if you will go with me but how do you think it is possible for me to leave you  a feeling which i cannot explain   lis and one i cannot explain   doc but i am going to prescribe  and it is improper  enter la fluer leading the marquis dressed in a handsome robe de chamber and night cap the doctor draws the chair la fluer this doctor is your patient  this is the renouned physician from whom you are to expect a cure   doc he looks surprisingly well considering how much he has suffered   la fluer that renders his case the more dangerous  i would rather a patient of mine should look ill and be in no danger than look well and be in imminent danger   mar to conceive the sufferings i have undergone a being must be transformed he must be more before he can conceive what have felt  for months have i led this agonizing life  but i am told doctor you can put an end to my disorder  you have in your possession that which can give me ease  but by what science you are master of so great a power i own is beyond my comprehension   la fluer dear sir you know not half the resources in the art of medicines trust firmly that you are  persons well inormd and well

consent to his wishes and as he finds he is beloved by the young lady which before he was in doubt of    lis pshaw he might easily have guessed her sentiments a young woman weary of confinement as she was is easily in love with the first young man who solicits her affections   la fluer and may i hope you love me   lis aye sir i am weary of confinement like my mistress   la fluer a thousand thanks my dear lisette   lis but while jeffry keeps the keys of every door no creature can either go out or enter without his leave   la fluer and is there no way to get rid of him   lis yes a thought strikes me this moment a couple of days ago one of our neighbors dogs bit him and our doctor merely to show his skill in the cure persuaded him the dog was mad suppose we make the doctor himself believe he was really so and that poor   enter doctor doc he has had another fit but i have just now left him in a sound sleep which come upon him as suddenly as any of his waking paroxysms   la fluer

comes with another glass of water to throw at him he starts lis see see how he looks only at the sight of water   jef if you dare throw any more upon   holds up his hand doc lisette let him alone it is dangerous to push the poor creature to extremities doctor suppose we magnetize him   la fluer no magnetism in cases like this can have no effect   doc what remedy then   la fluer i know of but one
