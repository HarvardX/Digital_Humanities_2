his majestys most gracious speech to both houses of parliament on thursday the   th of october      my lords and gentlemen the present situation of america and my constant desire to have your advice concurrence and assistance on every important occasion have determined me to call you thus early together  those who have long too successfully labored to inflame my people in america by gross misrepresentations and to infuse into their minds a system of opinions repugnant to the true constitution of the colonies and to their subordinate relation to great britain now openly avow their revolt hostility and rebellion they have raised troops and are collecting a naval force they have seized the public revenue and assumed to themselves legislative executive and judical powers which they already exercise in the most arbitrary manner over the persons and properties of their fellow subjects and although many of these unhappy people may still retain their loyalty and may be too wise not to see the fatal consequence of this usurpation and wish to resist it yet the torrent of violence has been strong enough to compel their acquiescence till a sufficient force shall appear to support them  the authors and promoters of this desperate conspiracy have in the conduct of it derived great advantage from the difference of our intentions and theirs they meant only to amuse by vague expressions of attachment to the parent state and the strongest protestations of loyalty to me whilst they were preparing for a general revolt on our part though it was declared in your last session that the rebellion existed within the province of the massachusets bay yet even that province we wished rather to reclaim than to subdue the resolutions of parliament breathed a spirit of moderation and forbearance consiliatory propositions accompanied the measures taken to enforce authority and the coercive acts were adapted to cases of criminal combinations amongst subjects not then in arms i have acted with the same temper anxious to prevent if it had been possible the effusion of the blood of my subjects and the calamities which are inseparable from a state of war still hoping that my people in america would have discerned the traitorous views of their leaders and have been convinced that to be a subject of great britain with all its consequences is to be the freest member of any civil society in the known world  the rebellious war now levied is become more general and is manifestly carried on for the purpose of establishing an independent empire i need not dwell upon the fatal effects of the success of such a plan the object is too important the spirit of the british nation too high the resources with which god has blessed her too numerous to give up so many colonies which she has planted with great industry nursed with great tenderness encouraged with many commercial advantages and protected and defended at much expense of blood and treasure  it is now become the part of wisdom and in its effects of clemency to put a speedy end to these disorders by the most decisive exertions for this purpose i have increased my naval establishment and greatly augmented my land forces but in such a manner as may be the least burdensome to my kingdoms  i have also the satisfaction to inform you that i have received the most friendly offers of foreign assistance and if i shall make any treaties in consequence thereof they shall be laid before you and i have in testimony of my affection for my people who can have no cause in which i am not equally interested sent to the garrisons of gibraltar and port mahon a part of my electoral troops in order that a larger number of the established forces of this kingdom may be applied to the maintenance of its authority and the national militia planned and regulated with equal regard to the rights safety and protection of my crown and people may give a farther extent and activity to our military operations  when the unhappy and deluded multitude against whom this force will be directed shall become sensible of their error i shall be ready to receive the misled with tenderness and mercy  and in order to prevent the inconveniences which may arise from the great distance of their situation and to remove as soon as possible the calamities which they suffer i shall give authority to certain persons upon the spot to grant general or particular pardons and indemnities in such manner and to such persons as they shall think fit and to receive the submission of any province or colony which shall be disposed to return to its allegiance it may be also proper to authorize the persons so commissioned to restore such province or colony so returning to its allegiance to the free exercise of its trade and commerce and to the same protection and security as if such province or colony had never revolted  gentlemen of the house of commons  i have ordered the proper estimates for the ensuing year to be laid before you and i rely on your affection to me and your resolution to maintain the just rights of this country for such supplies as the present circumstances of our affairs require among the many unavoidable ill consequences of this rebellion none affects me more sensibly than the extraordinary burden which it must create to my faithful subjects  my lords and gentlemen  i have fully opened to your views and intentions the constant employment of my thoughts and the most earnest wishes of my heart tend wholly to the safety and happiness of my people and to the reestablishment of order and tranquillity through the several parts of my dominions in a close connection and constitutional dependence you see the tendency of the present disorders and i have stated to you the measures which i mean to pursue for suppressing them whatever remains to be done that may farther contribute to this end i commit to your wisdom and i am happy to add that as well from the assurances i have received as from the general appearances of affairs in europe i see no probability that the measures which you may adopt will be interrupted by disputes with any foreign power
