row j brotherton and w meadows in cornhill and j graves in st jamess street    0  to sir thomas hanmer my father having the honor to owe his education and good fortune to the happy influence of your ancestors i cannot but as a grateful tribute pay these following sheets to the worthy son of so worthy a father  i have this as the greatest misfortune attending me that i have not the honor to be personally known to you yet nothing could have hindered my waiting on you to have paid those acknowledgments that are owing to your family but the service of my king and country that commands me away which if i fall in will be a sufficient recompense for all the hazards and dangers i have run which you will find in the succeeding pages but if providence which i need not doubt from the many imminent escapes i have had returns me safe to my native country i hope you will excuse my boldness if i endeavor to let you know the obligations that are incumbent upon  your most obedient humble servant r falconer  preface i am told that a book without a preface is like a new play without a prologue or a french dinner without soup and though i cannot tell what to say yet i am resolved to say something though perhaps not any thing to the purpose so far i hope you will allow me to be an author i shall give you gentle reader if you are so three of my reasons why i publish these following pages which i must confess are not so well polished as i could wish but truth is amiable though in rags the first and chiefest to get money for though i have a considerable income yet i can never bring both points together at the years end but however dont blame my economy since i owe you nothing and if i am beholden to any body it is to honest chetwood my bookseller i beg his pardon if i miscall him though i dont believe it will anger him in the least for all men love to be termed so whether they deserve it or no being he will run the greatest risque if my book does not sell second to save my lungs and a great deal of trouble in repeating to my friends these following adventures for now they may at a small expense get em by heart if they will endeavor to stretch their memories third and lastly to appear in print which was i assure you a great motive with me as well as with a great many others of the same rank that make work for many printers though as little to the purpose as my self i could give a catalogue of some of em but that would be making my preface exceed the bulk of my book though i could put the booksellers in a way to save money in their pockets and that is to persuade a great many authors to print their lucubrations at their own charge and that might make some of the poorest to desist but for the richer sort of authors there is no help it is like the itch and they must write to be scratched though the blood comes the following sheets however extraordinary they appear i assure you upon the word of a man are truth and i hope they will entertain you but if they dont and you should chance to slight em you will not anger  your servant r falconer canterbury nov        the voyages and adventures of capt richard falconer book i i was born at a town called bruton in somersetshire of parents tolerably well to pass in the world my mother died when i was very young my father richard falconer had been a great traveller in his days and his frequently repeating his adventures abroad made me have a great desire to follow his steps i often begged he would let me go to sea with some captain of his acquaintance but he would often say dick stay where you are you know not the hazard and dangers attend a maritime life you shall have a good trade in your belly and that will keep you from a desire of rambling therefore tell me what calling you like best that i may immediately put you out in order to your living hereafter you know continued he that my fortune is but small and i living to the extent of it it will not be possible for me to leave you wherewithal to support you without some employment therefore replied i as you have a daughter you may leave your substance to her she must be provided for as for our sex we can best take care for our selves and if you please but to fit me out to sea even in what station you think convenient it shall be all i will desire son says my father think no more of going to sea for i will not have it so i know it is only a desire of youth prone to change if i should give you leave i am assured one weeks voyage would make you wish to be at home again i used all the arguments my young sense prompted me with but all to no purpose my father was not to be moved and thus i lived two years longer with him in expectation of his mind altering at last an accident happened that fartherd my desires and though it was the ruin of our family i must confess i was not much concerned  my father was supervisor of a tax laid upon the burning of pipes and he having gathered a sum of money amounting to   00 l in order to pay in to the government for the kings use was by an under exciseman robbed of the whole sum who made his escape my father used all possible means to apprehend him without noise but all his endeavors were fruitless so finding his affairs in a desperate condition resolved to retire to some part of the world where he might be safe from the griping hands of the law one morning just before his voluntary exile he called me to him dick says he you have been often desirous of going to sea and i have always used arguments to dissuade you from it but now since what has happened it being impossible for me to continue upon the place of my birth the patrimony of my ancestors i must even recommend that way of life to you which i should never have chose but that the exigency of my affairs will not permit me to provide any other way for you here continued he take this  00 l which i can ill spare out of my little fortune but since it is all i can do for you take it and may heaven prosper thy undertakings may the blessing of a father always live with you whose prayers shall ever be sent to our almighty creator for thy welfare here added he is a letter of recommendation for you to captain pultney of bristol whose friendship i am sure will be of service to you with that he embraced me with tears in his eyes gave me his blessing kissed me and took his leave for ever for never have my eyes beheld him since  this parting i think was the greatest grief my thoughts had ever known till then for nothing could be fonder or show more paternal affection than my dear father at his last farewell but the joy of my being at liberty to follow my own desires soon drowned my sorrow for parting with so good a parent  i had now nothing to do but to provide my little equipage in order to go to bristol to my fathers friend i packed up my things in a portmantua and gave them to an old servant of my fathers who would see me as far as bristol for his sake we set out in the morning and reached it by noon i inquired for captain pultney and by good fortune found him at his dwelling house in ratcliff street he having removed himself from another street which caused some difficulty in the finding i acquainted him who i was and gave him my fathers letter he read it and received me very kindly it was to this effect  dear pultney i hope you will forgive this trouble of your friend i have sent my son to you in order to get him some post by sea i know it is in your power to do it something has happened that hinders my providing for him as i ought i would have waited on you in person but a gap has happened in my affairs that i shall never close again dick will tell you all let me conjure you by our old friendship to take all the care you can of him and whenever he comes to england let him come to you for as yet i know not where to lead my wretched life so that i shall confide in you and let you know by a letter or messenger as soon as possible where i shall settle  your most faithful friend and servant r falconer   mr falconer says the captain i am heartily sorry for your fathers misfortunes which he tells me in his letter you will inform me of after i had given him the whole story he told me he would provide for me as soon as possible and till then i should be as welcome to him as his own son in the mean time says he i would have you verse your self in the mathematics which may be of use to you i will take care to provide you a master and instruments which accordingly he did and as i had a great desire to be abroad and had some small knowledge of it which i learned at school apart from my other studies i soon attained to the theory of it  after i had run through the course of mathematics and the captain was informed i was capable he got me to be mate or rather assistant on board the albion frigate captain wase commander and on the   d of may      we set sail bound for jamaica with a fair wind as soon as we lost sight of land i began to be extremely seasick and bore the jests of the sailors but indifferently who cried there is an excellent mastersmate he will hit jamaica to a hair if the island were no bigger than the bunghole of a cask i must confess i believe my self to be the only person who ever set out on his first voyage as mastersmate without having seen a river that was navigable but in a day or two i was perfectly well and was never troubled with any sickness afterward  we had nothing material happened to us till we entered the bay of biscay where we were encountered with a dreadful storm the billows ran mountains high and our vessel seemed to be the sport of the waves a ship that overtook us the day before and accompanied us though it were not at half a furlong distance was sometimes lost by reason of the height of the waves the storm continued with this violence three days and at last abated something of its fierceness but still blew very hard the other vessel by firing a gun and making a signal made it appear she was in distress but the sea ran so high it was impossible to give them any assistance yet we bore down to them being to windward as nigh as we could without danger to our selves we inquired into the matter and found she had sprung a leak they had all hands to pump by turns but yet the water gained on them they begged of us to hoist out our boat their own being stavd to give them succor upon occasion accordingly we put out our longboat with two of our men in it but the rope that held her to the ship broke by the violence of the waves and drove away with the two unfortunate men in her and what became of them we could never learn but undoubtedly they perished by the sea or hunger we being  0 leagues from any shore the ship after prodigious labor of the sailors and in less than ten minutes sunk to the bottom out of fifty seven men but four were saved and they by good fortune laid hold on ropes we threw out for that purpose but it had not been possible to save any if we had not bore down to leeward when we saw them in the last extremity and here we ought to admire at providence for this very vessel was a pyrate one captain jones commander who in an open large boat set out from dover and near ostend stole upon a french vessel in the night murdered the captain and some others and set all the sailors ashore that would not embrace their designs and had resolved to attack us as soon as the storm was over the four men that were saved were three english men and one french man who said they were forced with several others by the above mentioned captain jones to take to that course of life but whether true or false i cannot tell indeed they behaved themselves very well with us all the voyage and were entered into our books as four of the ships crew instead of two we left on shore who were not to be found when we set sail and the two poor wretches that were lost in the boat the storm still continued but the wind fair so we ran it away with a rivd foresail all night and the next morning we had a violent storm of rain and some thunder but about noon the sky cleared up the rain ceased and the tempest was laid the wind however continuing fair with a midling gale  may the   th we discovered the canaries and the pike of teneriff and passed this island or rather rock of a prodigious height at night the wind rose again and continued to blow very hard for two days as i was walking on the deck one morning my chops were saluted with a fish which dropped down i took it up panting at the gills for life it proved to be a flying fish pursued as i suppose by some dolphin or albecore the manner of these fishes avoiding their enemies is jumping out of the water and flying till their wings are dry then fall down again into the sea the dolphin that chases them is one of the finest colored fish that swims i have observed our painters draw them bending like a bow but i think it is as strait a fish as any in the sea we caught one of them with a fizgig an instrument made of several rows of iron spikes bearded like hooks and a staff four or five foot long to it to this they tie a cord of a great length and dart it with all their strength the wounded fish immediately flownces downward many fathoms and up again which the darter observes giving him rope and play till his weakness makes him more tame then they draw him up the shipsside and cut him in pieces the first we caught in this manner was about six foot long which we dressed and part of it served the whole ships company for dinner as soon as it was caught it lost that beautiful color it had in the water as for my own part notwithstanding their praising it i had rather eat a herring or a mackrel than this rare fish i dont know whether these fish can hear or love music but this i am sure of we had an excellent trumpet on board which diverted us in good weather and i have observed that at the sound of it the number of these dolphins seemed to increase and swim within two foot of our vessel but that may be pure accident yet i fancy there is something in it that occasioned the fable of amphion and the dolphin sharks are taken as we take common fish only the hook is about two foot long and an iron chain above that about four foot long and a long rope to that they generally bait the hook with a piece of beef of three or four pounds which the voracious fish swallows immediately hook and all then they give him play a while and when he is pretty well spent they draw him in with a tackle there is always one stands ready with an axe to make a divorce between his tail and his body otherwise he would give such large thumps with it that might do the ship damage i my self was thrown down but with a touch of it this that we took had in his paunch the collarbone of a man and a boatswains silver whistle with a red ribbon in it entire not so much as bruised which was given to me as a present to make me amends for the fall i received it may be seen at my booksellers if any one has the curiosity to ask for it as to the collarbone not any one would accept of it so i returned it to the watery element again  we past the tropic attended by the tropickbirds a fowl something bigger than a pidgeon but one would think as it flies it had an unlighted candle fixed in its tail i cannot let go the ceremony of passing this tropic when you are in the latitude the old sailors ask the rest of the ships crew whether they were ever that way before if not they must either pay a bottle and pound as they call it or be duckd they that dont pay are fixed to a rope at the mainyardarm and duckd three times in the sea at which the rest of the crew huzza and fire a volley of smallshot  when admiral benbow went with his squadron of men of war the whole fleet duckd but the admiral gave em notice by first firing a gun which was immediately followed with a volley of muskets and huzzaing by every ship in the fleet a day or two before our account is out we send a man to the topmasthead in order to discover land where he stays an hour and looks about him he that discovers it first is rewarded with a bottle and pound that is a bottle of rum and a pound of sugar which is demanded as soon as the anchor is cast in a place where such commodities are to be had now the bottles and pounds that accrue from the people that are not willing to be duckd in passing the tropic are reserved by the old sailors for a merry bout when safe in harbor which must not be touched by the fresh men as they call em  july the  d our man at the topmasthead instead of crying land as we expected called out a sail a sail which in a quarter of an hour we discovered plainly upon deck we did not know what to think of it we knew we were near land and consequently in fear of those pirates or buccaniers that infest those coasts our captain called all hands aloft and told us gentlemen it is one to one but this vessel we see may be a pyrate if so how must we behave our selves if you are resolved to stand it i will stand it to the last if not well surrender without firing a gun which may induce em to be civil to us the sailors cried let us fight em let us fight em with that we put our chests in the hold and brought up our hammocks to place em in the netting on the quarter deck we cleared our guns which were twelve and mustered our men which amounted to thirtyeight passengers and all who were as willing to fight as any of us they having something on board that was valuable and some of em perhaps all their fortune we kept our way and the ship bore up to us with all the sail she could make night coming upon us our man at the topmasthead discovered land and another ship to the windward of us with that we called another council and persisted in our first opinion of fighting but yet to use all means possible of making to shore which was barbados but for all our endeavors the first ship got up with us and about twelve a clock at night hailed us and commanded us to hoist out our boat and come on board him with our captain we answered we had never a boat as indeed we had not but we told him if he would stay till morning something might be done at last he threatened to sink us if we would not send our captain aboard immediately and thereupon fired a gun which struck our vessel on her quarter with that we fired our broadside upon him accompanied with some small arms which they little expecting i believe did some damage and put em in confusion whereupon we tacked about and with our other six guns raked her fore and aft but was immediately seconded with a broadside from them which killed us two men and wounded a third upon which with loud huzzas and firing they immediately boarded us on our starboardquarter and poured into us at least fourscore men we resisted em with all the force we had but all to no purpose they drove us into the forecastle where by good chance we made shift to barricade our selves but they threatened to turn our own guns upon us if we did not surrender immediately but our captain being resolute ordered us to fire upon em with our small arms now we had under the greatings close to our steerage a large cistern lined with tin where we had unwittingly placed several cartriges of powder but happily for us whether it was our firing or in the bustle some match dropped in i know not but the powder took fire blew up the greatings with some part of the quarter deck and thirty of the enemy at least into the air upon that we sallied out and drove the rest with our cutlashes into their own vessel again with the loss of several but this signified little for with the fall and breach of our quarter deck the powderroom was entirely stopped up nor could we without great difficulty clear it from the lumber so that we had not any powder but what was in the mens cartriges for their muskets however we fired briskly with em yet nevertheless they prepared to board us again with all the menaces imaginable this fight continued at least four hours and the dawn began to break upon us which discovered to us the other ship we saw over night and we distinguished english colors with that we gave a great shout and fired our small arms again the enemy no sooner saw the ship with english colors but they cut off their grapplingirons and did their endeavor to make off but their rigging was so shattered that their sails could not be hoisted in the mean time the other ship came up to us and without hailing poured a broadside into the pyrate and there followed a desperate fight between them as for our ship it was of little use so we steered off and cleared our gunroom and in half an hour the fight continuing all that while we had charged our great guns and returned to the fight but upon the instant we saw the pyrate sinking the english ship had tore a hole between wind and water that she sunk in a moment and but eight men saved who told us their captain was a pyrate from guadalupe that when they were sinking they had not above twenty men left out of an hundred and sixty and most of them wounded the ship that gave us this seasonable rescue was the guernsey frigate whose station was barbados we lay by for an hour or two to repair our rigging etc and hailed her desiring em to send a boat on board for our captain because we were without one which accordingly they did captain wase and i went immediately on board to pay our respects to their commander who received us with all imaginable civility we had on board our ship seven sailors and two passengers killd the one joseph ridge of barbados and the other daniel thompson of mevis merchant and four wounded the guernsey had sixteen men killed and three wounded among which was the lieutenant who died the same day of a wound he received in his thigh with a musket ball chewed which made the wound mortal the captain invited us to dine with him which we did where we were treated with a new dish at least to me a pollo that is fowls boiled with rice and salt pork which was very palatable we took our leaves of the captain and went on board of our own vessel and at five a clock in the evening july the  th after saluting the town cast anchor in carlisle bay  barbados for its bigness is the richest and best peopled island in all america it is seated in thirteen degrees twenty minutes in length twenty four measured miles and in the broadest part about sixteen it resembles a leg of mutton with the knuckle off the north and east sides are fortified by nature from any harm from ships of war by reason there is no anchoring place on the southeast and westerly part are four excellent commodious wellfortifyd harbors the chief is that where we now ride which will contain a thousand sail of ships free from the danger of any winds at the bottom of this harbor stands the capitol of the island called st michaels with a fort at each end and a platform in the middle which makes it of strength sufficient to opposea royal navy it is a neat large town with two churches one with a handsome organ for largeness i think this town may compare with our city of salisbury but better inhabited as for the other three which are   charles town   st jamess town   little bristol in sprights bay i can give no manner of account of but for my readers satisfaction if he will consult ligons history of barbados he may come to the best knowledge of the whole island they are governed by the same laws as we in england a native of barbados told me the whole island contained at least   0000 inhabitants slaves included  july the  0th after our captain had left his passengers and part of his cargo we set sail for jamaica here you must note that from barbados to jamaica you always have the wind in your stern we passed martinico dominica guadalupe and antegoa and the first of august anchored at mevis where we had immediately the friends of mr daniel thompson merchant on board us to unlade the goods for they had heard of his death by a vessel from barbados a week before  mevis or nevis lies in seven degrees nineteen minutes it is six leagues in circumference there is but one harbor in the whole island which some call mevis harbor or bath bay where lies the town under the former denomination it is pretty well secured with a fort and platform of great guns i was informed by one of the inhabitants that there is a mineral water very good to bathe in which cures the same distempers with our bath in somersetshire  the english settled here ann dom      and have increased from one hundred and forty to five thousand and upwards they send abroad as much sugar ginger cotton and tobacco as any island of its bigness in the caribbees they are very regular in their government here they neither allow of drunkenness nor whoring i mean in common as in barbados jamaica etc here i was first saluted with a little fly called a musketo and though it is small yet it has a devilish sharp sting with it they get into our stockings and are so very troublesome to new comers that there is hardly any bearing of em if you scratch the places stung by em till the blood comes it may prove dangerous i my self kept a sore leg three months upon that account i was also informed there was a flea they call chigos which breed in dust or ashes and of all the insects in the caribbees this is the most dangerous they get into the nails of the toes imperceptibly and from thence run over all the body though they chiefly fix themselves in the bottom of the feet which occasions an itching followed with holes in the skin they make blisters as big as peace in the flesh where their young ones breeding cause ulcers and rotten flesh which there is no remedy for but to eat away the parts affected with aquafortis and burntalum while we lay here there was a sword fish ran himself ashore which was supposed to be done in eagerly chasing some other fish it had no scales but a dusky skin and a white belly rough like a smiths file a flat head two fins on each side two on the back and one instead of a tail it is a fish of prodigious swiftness the sword which is fixed in the head is six seven and sometimes eight foot long near his eyes are two nostrils out of which he throws the water a great height into the air this fish often encounters with the whale and proves too hard for him for with his sword he rips up the whale i bought one of these swords of a poor inhabitant for four bottles of english beer which is a great rarity with them that he got in a piece of a wreck but thrust in so far that the end in getting out was broke three inches  next to mevis lies st christophers or as we generally call it st kits in seventeen degrees and twenty five minutes northward of the equinoctial it is twenty five leagues in circumference the soil light and sandy and produces fruit common with us in england in the middle of this island rises a high mountain from which runs streams of fresh water that sometimes swell so high with sudden rains that they drown all the country near em this island is inhabited by both english and french who even in the time of war live very friendly together there was formerly discovered a silver mine here which the english and french claim an equal title to but neither make any use of it by reason of the want of miners the english liberties are better peopled than the french but the french have more conveniences and better fortified places than the english an english friar belonging to the french jesuits who gave me this description told me that the french had built a town called basse terre in a harbor of the same name and chief in the island full as big as gravesend with very handsome houses for the merchants and trades people which are many where there is also an hospital to maintain their indigent sick together with a handsome free school with large endowments for the children of the island but what they mostly brag of is their castle which is built about a furlong from the sea at the foot of a high mountain shadowed with great trees in the way thither stand the houses of the governor and other officers for more security seated in a walk of orange and lemon trees from the brow of the sea up to the castle which is three story high built with freestone and brick the halls and chambers are very lightsome and high and the walls are adorned with cedar on the top is a flat terrace which yields a delightful prospect all over the country the winds which blow from the hills so tempers the heat that it makes it more pleasant than any other island of the caribbees as to the english plantations they are not much inferior to the french they have six churches and two chapels for divine service this island was planted jointly by english and french in      captain thomas warner for the english and one desnambuc for the french the natives made a vigorous resistance but to little purpose with this success they returned back to their several countries and went again and settled there but the english having more supplies from london daily increased when on the contrary the merchants at paris grew weary seeing no return for all the charges they had been at but whilst this business seemed to go on with success an accident happened which ruined all at once the king of spain set out a fleet the same year of thirty one galloons three galleases and four pinnaces with four thousand men under the command and direction of frederick de toledo from cadiz antonio nunnez barrico and francisco de almeida commanders of twenty galleys from portugal these joined with the abovementioned with a resolution to drive the english french and dutch entirely out of the american islands coming before mevis they took nine english vessels after that they sailed to st christophers where captain desnambuc although not prepared for defense because their fortifications were not finished drew all his forces near the shore to hinder their landing but captain rossey who commanded another port suffered em to land without the least resistance whereupon young desnambuc lieutenant of a company under rossey sallied out and fell valiantly on the first company of spaniards killing many of em and put em to the rout but the spaniards being seconded by another battalion he was slain after having made a stout resistance and forsaken by all his men rossey upon this abandons his intrenchments and flies to the hills and high grounds whereupon the spaniards became masters of the forts but durst not follow rossey for fear of an ambuscade which fear proved true for desnambuc undermining the fort retired on board some vessel prepared for that purpose and made off in the mean time the powder taking fire blew up the fort and six hundred spaniards into the air the english relying upon the league between spain and england made no resistance but sent agents to toledo etc to put him in mind of the league between their masters to which he replied that st christophers being part of the western world was given by the pope to his master philip nevertheless he gave em six of the nine vessels they took at mevis to imbark themselves on condition they would sail immediately for england which they agreed to but the six vessels not holding all the rest were left on the island for another opportunity no sooner was toledo out of sight but the remaining part of the english inhabitants took fresh courage and rebuilt several forts and made every thing ready for defense if occasion should be in the mean time desnambuc suffered a great deal of hardship through ill weather and want of provision having been at several islands intending to settle with his little company but not liking any of em and hearing that the enemy were gone to the havana and the english were busy tilling their grounds he returned to his former station where they suffered many hardships till some vessels from the netherlands arrived and furnished em with provisions ammunition and clothes upon credit but in a few years they paid all and grew rich from their plentiful stock of tobacco sugars ginger and indigo till they brought it to the rich and flourishing state it now remains in  having ended our affairs we set sail for jamaica the   st of august      and on the  th of september anchored safe in port royal harbor in the great and flourishing island of jamaica without any accident this was our last station here we were to unlade the remaining part of our goods and take in its return rum sugar and spice  this island of jamaica is the only mart of all america for the english which drive a large trade here but wickedness is in its full perfection i remember captain wase asked one of our men that had spent some money ashore what was his opinion of the honesty of the women of port royal why truly says tarr very bluntly if there is one honest woman should happen to tumble down i believe there is never another to take her up provision is prodigious dear here two or three of us went on shore to dinner one day at port royal where we had only a roasted turkey wretchedly lean and nothing nigh so well tasted as our english turkeys and our eating came to thirty shillings but then to make amends money is plenty enough we had a sailor on board that had been a tailor by trade this fellow got leave of the captain to go on shore for a month where he cleared by working journeywork twelve pound for that month but then he had the ships provision carried on shore to him two or three times a week had he been to have paid for his diet he had saved but a small matter i was mightily surpised to see a market for turtle in the same manner as our butchers this is a meat or rather fish of an odd nature but of an excellent taste the lean looks like the flesh of pork but something of a deeper red the fat is a sort of a light green but very luscious this is the common diet of the slaves or meaner sort of people but if strangers eat too much of it it is apt to give em the bloody flux this is a very reigning distemper here and carries off abundance of new comers the island of jamaica lies  leagues north from the southern continent of america in the sea called mare del nor and south from the isle of cuba about twelve leagues and twenty west from hispaniola in eighteen degrees northern latitude and bears from rio de hach northwest a hundred and fifty leagues from santa martha n n w a hundred and thirtyfive from carthagena n a hundred and fourteen from portobello n e and by n a hundred and ninety from the isthmus of darien n and by e a hundred and seventy and from the bay of mexico a hundred and fifty its form is almost oval being in length from east to west about fifty four leagues from north to south in the broadest part twenty three leagues going narrower toward each end like a rowlingpin a good comparison in circumference one hundred and fifty leagues the air of this island is more temperate and the heat more tolerable than any of the other islands by reason of the cool breezes which constantly blow from the east with frequent showers of rain and dews that fall in the night these dews are very pernicious to careless drunken people that lie exposed all night to em this is also the only isle of the barloventi which is not subject to violent storms and hurricanes as the other islands are and the diseases that are predominant here are only bred by intemperance as surfeits bloody flux fevers and agues or occasioned by ill diet or slothfulness this island is well watered with springs and rivulets of fresh water with many handsome rivers stored with several sorts of fish and is all over especially in the western parts full of high mountains and hills it is also well wooded for the north and south parts chiefly abound with large and tall woods neither is there wanting savannas or plains the commodities of this island are very many and first for vegetables the sugars are so good that they now out sell those of barbados   s per cent tobacco is so excellent that it is bought up faster than the planters can cure it the indigo is also here very good the cotton is much the best of all the neighboring islands tortoiseshell is very plenty here here are also great variety of dyewood as fustwick redwood a kind of logwood cedar mohogeny lignumvitae ebony granadille and many others nay there is many mines both of silver copper and gold but that the inhabitants think it would be dangerous to break em up for fear of drawing the spanish and french buccaniers upon em there are several fishermen who have found pieces of ambergrease upon the surface of the water near the shore ginger grows better here than in any other part of america and codpepper very plentifully and also a certain kind of spice called piemete in form of east india pepper of a very aromatical and curious taste partaking as it were of several species together it grows wild among the mountains and is highly valued among the inhabitants of medicinal plants i have seen several as guaiacum chinaroot cassia fistula veuillard achiotes tamarines contrayerva ciperas adiantumnigrum aloes cucumis agristis sumach acacia misselto with many other drugs and balsams the ingenious sir hans sloan has wrote an elaborate book of the plants of this island cochineal is produced by a plant that grows in this country but not brought to perfection without much care and industry this island is also very well stocked with cattle as horses cows and asses there have been many mules but the inhabitants made so little use of em that now there are but few sheep are large and tall and their meat indifferently good but their fleece worth nothing goats or cabirates are without number being a beast peculiar to the country hogs both wild and tame in abundance i have been hunting the wild hog in porta morant bay and it gives good diversion though sometimes dangerous you go with some ten or a dozen in company armed with a musket and a cutlash as soon as ever with your dogs you have found em out you all take aim and fire as quick as you can but if you dont kill em immediately with your shot they set upon you openmouthed so that you must either hew em down with your cutlashes or club your muskets generally as soon as you have em you flay em as you do mutton and barbicue em even in the very place where you kill em that is you dig a square hole in the earth then clap four stakes at each corner and on em put your meat so make a fire under it and when one side is done enough you turn the other for tame fowls they have of all the kinds that we have in england besides guinea hens parrots parachites machaws and boobies which are boobies indeed for they will sit upon a tree or post till you come and take em they have three crops a year in this island and the trees are always green they have three sorts of bread one of english corn another of guinea wheat and the third of a root they call casavi which is rank poison till pressed and baked in an oven it is very white but tasteless and the bread made of it the size of our thin oatcakes but of all the fruit this island produces the pineapple is the best which grows very low with leaves something like the indicus ficus that i have seen in gardens here in england the taste is so excellent that i know not what to compare it to it having the relish of all fineflavourd fruits there is a fruit that grows upon a low bush called the pricklepear the inside of which is red and on the top is a little thorny thing like a star which if you do not take away before you eat it may prove pernicious if you eat but two of this fruit it will make your urine as red as blood plantins are a very good fruit which is when baked in the ashes used by the slaves instead of bread it is a fruit with a skin on it like our beans which is taken off and then the fruit appears about the size of a bolognia sausage bannanas is another fruit something of the same kind but shorter and more luscious both these fruits are ripe all the year for when some are fit to gather others are green and some in bud the oranges and lemons are neither of em good in my opinion but their limes are wonderful they grow upon a tree full of thorns where you must be sure to prick your fingers if you will gather em these with spring water and sugar was the chief of my liquor while we staid there the potatoes are very fine here exceeding in my opinion even those of ireland then there is another root called jams something like a jerusalemartichoak but larger and stringy the onions of jamaica are much milder and better tasted than our english onions and very wholesome they used to make a great addition to our crogick brewis that is biscuit soaked in fair water for some time then the water thrown away and the biscuit strewn over with salt oil and limejuice together with onions and so eaten as a dainty dish there is a sensitive plant in this island the stalk surrounded with leaves full of dark red spots bears a sweet smelling violetcolourd flower the leaves as soon as touched close up together and die and accordingly as they are held in the hand a shorter or a longer time this alteration continues ginger grows plentiful here the male plant for there is sexes has generally bigger leaves than the female the stalks which are without knots have more leaves upwards than downwards and spreads along the earth still taking root anew when the leaves wither then the ginger is commonly ripe but it has not that poinancy whilst green as when dried the cotton of this place of which the clothes and hammocks are made are vended in most parts of the westeru world grows on a tree about the height of a peachtree with a strait stem or body out of which shoot boughs of an equal length and at equal distance between the leaves which are narrow and long grow red flowers and from em oval cods which when ripe enclose the cotton and a seed like pepper of hurtful creatures there is the crocodile or alligator which infest many rivers and ponds this is a creature of a monstrous size i have seen one twenty six foot long it moves swiftly and strongly forward but turns slow they are impenetrable every where but in the eye or belly they have four feet or fins with which they go or swim their usual course of getting their food is to lie on their backs as dead then with a sudden onset they spring upon their prey whether man or beast but it is easily avoided by a man by reason of an aromatic smell that comes from the body which may be smelt five hundred yards but if a man has got a cold and cannot smell if he has eyes they are easily avoided for if they run right forward it is but slipping on one side for they are as long in turning as a coach the oil that is made from these creatures is good for several distempers they lay their eggs about the size of a turkeys and cover em with sand which heated by the beams of the sun hatches the young ones who naturally creep into the water one of these creatures swam after us fifty yards in porto morant bay and raised his head upon the edge of our longboat which was deeply laden with casks of water our carpenter who had been felling of timber to wood the ship struck him a very great blow on the nose with his hatchet that i am sure hurt him for he gave a sort of shriek which no body ever heard before and swam to shore where i observed him to run his head into the mud as if it pained him which makes me think that their heads are not invulnerable as is reported the guana is another creature amphibious as the alligator but nothing nigh so large there is an island near jamaica called guana island inhabited by nothing else our seamen eat of these latter but much good may it do em for the flesh looks like a piece of a blackamores arm but how it tastes i cannot tell neither do i ever design to try the cocoa nut is a fruit that is both meat drink and clothing to the natives i mean the blacks the rind serves for weaving of clothes nay and rigging their canoes before they knew the europeans and when you have taken off the bark you must be beholding to a saw to cut off the monkeys face which is the top with three marks that makes it something resemble that animal then the inside contains first a liquid substance like whey but very sweet after you have taken out this liquor round the nut is a substance a quarter of an inch thick which you cut out and that is the meat which is very delicious and grateful to the taste but not wholesome if eat of too much there is another thing that is very remarkable and that is the phisicknut much of the taste of our pignuts but one or two of em will do your business upwards or downwards as well as dr annodynenecklaces sugarplumbs as i was going one day to dine with captain kendal a gentleman inhabitant within a mile of the bay in porto morant attended by a black a servant of his i saw in the hedge a fair apple growing on a bush which i readily gathered and was conveying to my mouth but prevented by the blacks giving me a blow on the hand which struck it from me i immediately with my sword in the scabbard fell to belabour the poor fellow for his insolence for i having been familiar with him and talked to him along the road thought he made our old english proverb true if you give an inch they will take an ell but it seems the fellow saved my life by it for this fruit which was called a mangineel apple was rank poison but what i had never seen or heard of before i was so concerned for the blows i had given the poor fellow that i gave him a dollar to make him amends i remember i was afterward washing my self at a river in the same bay and it raining very hard i went under a tree to save my clothes from being wet and in placing them together in a cavity of the shore the drops of rain fell on a mangineel tree and so on my back but in less than half an hour my flesh burned very hot and white blisters appeared upon my skin insomuch that i was in a high fever but a native of the place being with me ran for salt water and washed me all over and afterward got some oil and dipped my shirt in it and put it on my back which gave me ease immediately but the spots remained upon my skin several years afterward i dont doubt but my readers will laugh at me for thus running from one thing to another but i relate em just as my memory prompts me this island was first discovered by columbus anno dom      after he had conquered the natives and built a city called sevilla afterward st jago de la vega consisting of about seventeen hundred houses two churches two chapels and an abbey he made his son diego columbus governor of the whole island for his master ferdinand king of spain the first attempt made upon this island by the english was a d      under the command of mr antony shirley but after vanquishing the spaniards they deserted it as not thinking it worth their keeping and returned home the spaniards again possessing it remained unmolested till anno dom      when oliver cromwell then lord protector rigged out a fleet of ships to make a descent on hispaniola under the command of colonel venables but being disappointed of their hopes and meeting with ill success steered away for jamaica and on the  0th of may after a stout resistance made themselves masters of it the island is supposed to contain two hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants slaves included the chief towns are  st st jago about six miles up the country   dly passagetown six miles from that   dly and indeed the largest before the earthquake destroyed it port royal it contained a thousand houses many of them eminent buildings but as it is now built on a small neck of land which forms the harbor i take it to be about the bigness of deptford at both ends of the town is a large fort known by the name of the square and round fort the square fort or castle contains a hundred pieces of ordnance and the other about thirty besides several canon on the platform which reaches from one fort to the other so that without treachery they need not fear an attack either by land or sea about a mile farther is another small fort called landward fort which secures the town from any attempt by land off the mouth of the harbor toward the sea lie several small islands upon the most western of which lying within half a league of the town and by which all the vessels must pass they have erected a fort which contains eight guns the chief harbor after port royal is port st antony on the north a very safe commodious landlockd harbor only the coming in is something difficult the channel being narrowd by a little island that lies off the mouth of the port   d portomorant a very capacious harbor where ships do conveniently wood and water and ride safe from all winds   d on the south is port gagway which is much the largest of all that has been mentioned it being five leagues over in some places it is landlockd by a point of land that runs s w from the main of the island the road is so deep that a ship of a thousand tun may lay her side to the shore of the point and lade or unlade at pleasure with planks afloat  now finding our affairs would detain us half a year longer i got leave of the captain to go in a sloop with some of my acquaintance to get logwood and on september the   th we set sail for the bay of campeche with a fair wind the old manner of getting this wood is as follows a company of desperate fellows get together in a sloop well armed and land by stealth but in case of any resistance the whole crew attends on the cutters ready armed to defend em indeed there is a colony of english that sells this logwood but many choose the other way all this was strange to me for i knew nothing of the matter till we were out to sea there was one fellow there that told me that about ten years before he went with a vessel and they took the same method as usual in getting it and landed all their men but six that they left on board to look after the vessel in the mean time the spaniards having intelligence of their descent sent a hundred men in several canoes to seize their vessel which accordingly they did without any resistance from the six men on board after they had clapped these men under hatches they searched and ransacked the vessel sending every thing on shore that was of any value then they prepared to trepan the crew as they came on board which happened the very next night when some of the men coming on board with a load of logwood the spaniards caused the six men to stand upon deck and on pain of death not to discover the truth of the matter which happened as they desired for the men coming on board carelessly without their arms were all seized immediately and clapped in irons the rest that were on shore wondering at the stay of the boat sent a canoe with six men to know the reason of their delay which were likewise taken in the same trap with the former the man that told me this story was one of these last six who found means secretly in the middle of the night to slip into the water and swam ashore though a league off where he happily informed the rest of the crew which were forty three of the misfortune that had happened to their companions whereupon they consulted what they had best do where it was unanimously agreed to seize upon three large canoes that lay at the bottom of the bay that belonged to some french hunters that were on shore which was done accordingly on board they immediately got well armed and steered away for their sloop but as they designed to trick them the same way as the others had done their companions they consulted what to do if they should be discovered before they could get on board which was probable enough at length it was agreed to carry on the plot in order to deceive them and as soon as ever they could get over the ships side to assault the enemy with all the vigor imaginable appointing two or three to release their companions and put arms into their hands to be assistant in recovering their liberties every thing happened as was suggested for when they came within half a furlong of the vessel they were hailed by some of their own men as it is usual in such cases which was answered by them in the canoes with swearing and cursing at em for not coming ashore with their longboat as ordered but to force em to bring their wood aboard in canoes they asked from on board how many were come with em all answered they in the boat but three that we left ashore to look after our arms and a small remainder of logwood which you must go and fetch immediately with the longboat which they pretended could not go to em before by reason she had a hole broke in her bow against a piece of rock that gave em a great deal of trouble in getting her to the vessel our people smiled to themselves to hear they had got their lesson so ready in asking and answering these questions they had reached the vessel and getting nimbly up the side they drew from under their watchcoats their pistols and cutlashes and first fired upon the spaniards who were running to seize em half unarmed as not suspecting any resistance those whose office it was to release the prisoners under hatches did it immediately by killing the two centuries that watched over em and then coming up with this fresh recruit soon overcame the spaniards and made em call for quarter which was not granted till they had thrown down their arms when they had surrendered they chained em all under hatches and so the conquerors became prisoners and the prisoners conquerors after the action was over they looked after the dead which was found to be nine spaniards and one englishman who was supposed to be killed by our own men in the first fire  upon this good success they having notice that there lay a rich ship in the harbor before the town of campeche they resolved to try their good fortune farther which they contrived as follows they hoisted spanish colors and sailed away immediately for the port of campeche where they arrived by next morning saluted the castle and town with seven guns as friends and were paid back the complement the shore was filled with numbers of people to see the englishmen brought ashore prisoners but they were mistaken the ship which they had a design upon lay about a league from the town as having arrived but two days before but was to put farther in that very evening before the sea breeze failed our men boarded her on the starboardside which lay from the town and took her without firing a gun cut her cables and made out to sea before the town knew what was the matter but as soon as ever they smelt the trick a spanish man of war of thirty guns being all that was in the harbor slipped her cables and crowded all the sail she could to come up with us we finding she gained upon us called a council and at last resolved to bring up most of our spanish prisoners bound and expose em to the whole fire of the enemy which succeeded accordingly for the ship coming close up to us without any firing on either side commanded us to strike upon that we ordered the spanish captain to lay before em their condition which profited little at first but after many entreaties from them and threatenings from us the others were prevailed upon to sheer off and make toward the town while we made the best of our way but the spaniard making up to the town again was met by several armed boats with the governor himself in one of them who gave a strict command not to regard any thing but use all possible means to retake the ship and the pirates as they termed us when we perceived the boats making up to the ship and observed her tack about to give us chase we guessed at the matter and finding she gained upon us we put our selves into a posture of defense and proposed to engage her in the prize we took last which carried twenty guns we mustered our men and found we had seventy one but then we had two hundred spanish prisoners who we feared if by any accident they should get loose might prove our ruin whereupon a consult was immediately held to put most of them to death upon which the captain of the first prize stood up and said in pretty good english gentlemen you have taken us fairly and done no more than we our selves did to you now seeing that ship which pursues us and gains upon us every moment is coming in order to fight you we shall run a more certain danger by it by being your prisoners if you expose us to the fire of their canon as you did before and if they do really fire i may as well take them for an enemy as you since we are sure to receive the most damage but to make the matter short being the time is so i propose to you that if the vessel fires at you we may reasonably conclude they have no manner of regard for us so we shall not have any for them and if you will give us that liberty we will freely fight under your command and endeavor as far as in us lies to defend your vessel as much as if it was our own this speech of the captains was approved of by the rest of the prisoners so that at last we agreed to set sixty of them at liberty and the rest fast bound under hatches where we put two centuries with two patareroes fixed charged with small shot with orders that if there seemed to be any thing like disturbance to fire in upon em the sixty we chose out to be assistant to us were ordered to the great guns so that we still had the command over em because they had no arms after we had settled every thing we lay by seeing it impossible to escape without fighting in order for their coming up to us which they did in a short time and coming within hail they ordered us to strike immediately and make no resistance or else they would have no regard to their friends on board us but sink or take us and put every man of us to death upon which the spanish captain that was our prisoner made answer that if they offered to fire a gun every spaniard on board us resolved to fight against em as enemies which was answered they must obey the governors orders who had just left em and was returned on shore upon this they fired a broadside upon us but we returned it immediately with our small arms and great guns which were well plied by our spanish prisoners the fight continued half an hour with all the fierceness imaginable at last the spaniard prepared to board us with his boats at the same time but were received so briskly and so damaged by our handgranados that they were obliged to make to the ship with great loss the handgranados stood us in great stead for we dispatched three or four of our men into the maintop who from thence discharged several granados that by their own report killed and wounded above thirty men they attempted to board us once again and came on briskly with firing and loud shouts to terrify us but we returned em their shouts and firing with interest for with a lucky shot we drove away their mainmast which put em into strange confusion this accident if we would have laid hold on it might have given us an opportunity of outsailing em but that was not once thought of for desire of revenge made us fight like furies the next broadside we gave em struck away their rudder which rendered em incapable of steering their vessel or tacking about upon which we perceiving what had happened tacked about and with a broadside that racked her fore and aft killed em by their own confession sixteen men for it split two of their guns whose splinters did most of the execution now what we call to rake fore and aft is to lay the side of our ship against the enemys head or stern and fire into em so that every shot goes from one end of the ship to the other instead of going across so that of consequence one shot that way will do more damage than ten directly side to side the heat of the spaniard now began to abate but yet he hectored as much as ever at last a lucky shot entered her powderroom and blew up her main deck with several spaniards into the air upon which was heard such groans and yelling from wounded and dying men that were enough to frighten men less inured to such encounters with this success we prepared in the confusion to board them in our turn but was prevented by seeing their vessel sinking whereupon they struck down their colors and asked for quarter and help which we immediately gave em by putting out our boats which together with their own saved all the men they had left which were ninety five out of four hundred and odd  this success flushed us mightily with hopes of succeeding in any enterprise we lost out of our spaniards twenty six and of english nine killed and two wounded who died the next day the spaniards were of signal service to us and fought bravely even to desparation well knowing if they should be taken after fighting on our side they must all inevitably suffer death which proved happy for us for it had been impossible for us to have escaped em even if all the spaniards on board us had stood neuter  after we had cleared our vessel of the blood and dead men and refreshed our selves we called up our spanish prisoners that they might refresh themselves likewise and returned the others who had fought so bravely in our defense our hearty thanks and the spanish captain expressed himself so handsomely that our master freely offered him our sloop victuald and ready fitted up to do what he thought fit with upon this kind offer the captain smiled and told him he would not take it without buying and as for money i have none pursued he but if you will listen to a stratagem of mine i will engage to furnish you with money for your vessel and something over and above with that he proposed to take six of the spaniards that had fought for us and in our longboat to go on shore to the governor and demand a ransom for the prisoners we had taken which was agreed to accordingly they went ashore and told the governor if he did not immediately send fifty dollars a man for two hundred and twenty they would be every soul tied back to back and thrown into the sea upon which there was a gathering made through the town and the money raised immediately and in twelve hours the captain returned with   000 dollars gave our captain  000 distributed  000 among the sailors and kept the rest for himself the next day we set the spaniards that were saved from the man of war on shore and as many more that were willing out of the other ship and of our own sloop so that captain fernando our friendly spaniard took his leave of us with eighty of his countrymen with intention for the south sea and we steered our course in our rich prize for jamaica where we shared it every common sailor had to his share  00 l moreover the captain ordered me in particular  00 l more for the service i did in swimming ashore unperceived to give em notice  after ending his story i asked him how he had improved his money from that time psha says he that and five times as much is gone since then and this is no wonder for sailors are such fools that what they get with the utmost danger they spend as the meanest trifles we sailed before the wind six days together toward the bay but on the seventh the clouds darkened and the welkin seemed all on fire by times with lightning and the thunder roared louder than ever i heard it in my life in short a dreadful hurricane approached which was suspected by a deceitful calm and showers of rain which the inimitable shakespeare very justly describes  we often see against some storm a silence in the heavens the rack stand still the bold winds speechless and the orb below as hush as death the sailors had furled their sails and lowrd their topmasts waiting for it under a double rivd foresail which at last came with most extreme violence  either tropic now began thunder at both ends of heaven the clouds from many a horrid rift abortive poured fierce rain with lightning mixed water with fire in ruin reconciled dreadful was the rack as earth and sky would mingle milton in vain the master issues out commands in vain the trembling sailors ply their hands the giddy ship between the winds and tides forced back and forwards in a circle rides stunned with the different blows then shoots amain till counterbuffd she stops and sleeps again the face of things a frightful image bears and present death in various forms appears dryden the storm lasted with all its violence three hours and at last insensibly abated till it was stark calm and not one breath of wind was stirring nor any sign of one but a little froth on the surface  the tempest is oerblown the skies are clear and the sea charmed into a calm so still that not a wrinkle ruffles her smooth face dryden after the storm was over we loosed our sails in expectation of the wind which in half an hour stole out again as frightened at the violent storm or if you will grant me to make a simile like a poor debtor that steals out of his lurkingplace when the blustering bailiffs are gone out of sight about six in the evening we saw a waterspout this is an aerial engine or limbeck that draws up the salt water of the sea and distills it into fresh showers of rain this cloud comes down in form of a pipe of lead of a vast thickness and by the force of the sun sucks up a great quantity of water i stood an hour to observe it after it had continued about half an hour in the water it drew up insensibly by degrees till it was lost in the clouds but in the closing of the same it shut out some of the water which fell into the sea again with a noise like that of thunder and occasioned a smoke in the water that lasted for a considerable time the sailors told me that these waterspouts sometimes did great damage to ships that by calms were too near em when they fell one fellow told me that he saw a bark of sixty tun sucked out of the water by one of em which caused the breaking of the spout and sunk the vessel with the fall of the waters in the streights when ships approach these airy engines they fire off a gun and that breaks em before they come too near the person told me that at the fall of water the sea was curled as much as if you had thrown a large stone into a standing pond of water we have sometimes at a distance seen fourteen or fifteen at a time at work but i never saw one so large as this  in the evening we caught a small shark with two sucking fishes that stuck close to her till laid on the deck and then dropped down of their own accord this is allowed the remora of the ancients it is about the bigness of a mackrel with a flat head and is of a gristly substance these stick to the sides of vessels very frequently and sometimes swim upon the surface of the water and are even caught with a naked hook i have sometimes seen these fishes sticking to a log of wood in the water when we hogd our ship a hog is an instrument of six foot square something like a harrow and stumps of old brooms fixed close in the middle part this is put to the bottom of the ship with a rope before and another aft fixed to the capstorn which cleans the vessel from all sorts of filth i have seen many of em in the hog together with barnicles and oysters and several other shellfish  october the  th we anchored at trist island in the bay of campeachy and sent our men ashore at logwood creek to seek for the logwoodcutters who immediately came on board the bargain was soon struck and in exchange for our rum and sugar and a little money we got in our lading in eight days and set sail for jamaica the   th day of october  now in getting up to jamaica again generally takes us up two months because we are obliged to ply it all the way to windward one day it being stark calm i went into the water to wash my self though i was dissuaded by all the sailors by reason of that coast being infested with sharks which sometimes meet with people and bite off a limb but being there had not been any seen that day i would venture but tied a rope about me for fear of any accident that might happen or the wind striking up of a sudden but i had not been long in the water before they cried from the gunnel a shark a shark but i thinking they had only banterd as sometimes they do when any one is in the water did not mind em till at last they pulled me by main force up the side of the ship when looking into the water i saw a swinging large shark with his white belly turned up in order to bite at me upon which i thanked god and good friends that had prevented him by swiftly pulling me up though the rope had rubbed off the skin and some part of my flesh with the force now a shark cannot get his prey without first turning himself upon his back because their upper jaw is much larger than their under which often prevents accidents  i one day went down into the hold to bottle off a small parcel of wine that i had there for fear twoud sour which made me in a filthy pickle coming upon deck again i wanted to clean my self but did not care to go into the water as before so went into the boat astern that we hoisted overboard in the morning to look after a wreck that we discovered upon the water being in the boat i began to wash my self and when i had dressed my self again i pulled a book out of my pocket and sat reading in the boat when before i was aware a storm began to rise so that i could not get up the shipside as usual but called for the ladder of ropes that hangs over the ships quarter in order to get up that way but whether it was not fastened above or whether it broke through rottenness as being seldom used i cannot tell but down i fell into the sea and though the ship as they told me afterward tacked about to take me up if it was possible yet i lost sight of em through the duskiness of the evening and the storm together now i had the most dismal fears that could ever possess any one in my condition i was forced to drive with the wind which sat by good fortune with the current and having kept my self above water as near as i could guess in this fright four hours i felt my feet every now and then touch ground and at last by a great wave was thrown and left upon the sand yet it being dark i knew not what to do but i got up and walked as well as my tired limbs would let me and every now and then was overtaken by the waves but not high enough to wash me away  when i had got far enough as i thought to be out of danger i could not discover any thing of land and i immediately conjectured that it was but some bank of sand that the sea would overflow at high tide whereupon i sat down to rest my weary limbs and fit my self for death for that was all i could expect in my own opinion then all my sins came flying in my face which i repented of with all the sincerity imaginable i offered up my fervent prayers to our almighty creator not for my safety because i did not expect any such thing but for all my past offenses and i may really say i expected my dissolution with a calmness that made me think i had made my peace with heaven at last i fell asleep though i tried all i could against it by rising up and walking till i was obliged to lie down again in the morning when i awaked i was amazed to find my self among four or five very low sandy islands but all separated half a mile or more as i guessed by the sea with that i began to be a little cheerful and walked about to see if i could find any thing that was eatable but to my great grief i found nothing but a few eggs that i was obliged to eat raw this laid my condition before my eyes in a most horrid manner and the fear of starving seemed to me to be worse than that of drowning and often did i wish that the sea had swallowed me rather than thrown me on this desolate island for i could perceive by the evenness of em that they were not inhabited either by man or beast or any thing else but rats and several sorts of fowl  upon this island there was some few bushes of a wood they called burton wood which used to be my shelter at night but to complete my misery there was not to be found one drop of fresh water on the island so that i was forced to drink my own urine for two or three days together which made my skin come off like the peal of a boiled codlin at last my misery so increased that i was often in the mind to put an end to my wretched life but desisted on the opinion that i had of some alligator or other voracious creature coming to do it for me strange circumstances indeed to wish to be devoured alive as a mitigation of my misfortunes  i had lived a week here upon eggs only when by good fortune upon a bush i discovered a booby sitting i ran immediately as fast as i could and with a stick knocked him down i never considered whether it was proper to eat or no but i sucked the blood and eat the flesh with such a pleasure as none can express but them that have felt the pain of hunger to the same degree as my self after i had devoured this banquet i walked about and discovered many more of these birds which i slew  now my stomach being pretty well appeased i began to consider whether i could not with two sticks make a fire as i had seen blacks in jamaica i tried with all the wood i could get and at last happily did it this done i gathered some sticks and made a fire picked several of my boobies and broiled em as well as i could and now i resolved to come to an allowance this bird is a water fowl about the bigness of a large crow of gray color it has a long strong bill and feet like a duck and its flesh seemed to me to taste something like a ducks but stronger and a little fishy and it is such a booby that it will not get out of your way without beating  at night i and the rest of my fellowinhabitants had a great storm of rain and thunder with the redest lightning i had ever seen which well washed us all i believe as for my self my clothes which were only a pair of thin shoes and thread stockings and a cotton wastcoat and breeches were soundly wet but i had this happiness to find in the morning several cavities of rainwater which put in my head a thought of making a deep well or hollow place that i might have water continually by me which i brought to perfection in this manner i took a piece of wood i found on the island and pitched upon a place under a burtontree where with my hands and the stick together i dug a hole or well big enough to contain a hogshead of water then put in stones and pa vd it and got in and stamped em down ha rd all round and with my stick beat th e sides close so that i made it capable of holding water for a long time  but now the difficulty was how to get the water there which at last i contrived very well for with my shirt which was pretty fine i effected it by soaking it in water for some time and then afterward it would bear it very well so with this hollandbucket i could carry two gallons of water at a time which would not leak out above a pint in two hundred yards so in two days time i had filled my well  now i began to think of life again for a while for i had ready broiled forty of these boobies designing to allow my self half a one a day i also made my self a cu pboard of earth by mixing water with it which was four foot in length three in height and two in breadth though it lasted but four days the sun drying it so fast that it cracked and afterward fell in pieces what most amazed me and pleased me together was that my boobies continued sweet without the least taint i had a small ovid printed by elziver which i had by good fortune put in my breeches pocket when i was going up the ladder of ropes and by being pressed close in my pocket was not quite spoiled but only the cover off and stained a little with the wet this was a great mitigation of my misfortunes for i could entertain my self in this book under a burtonbush till i fell asleep i remained always in good health only a little troubled with the headache for want of a hat which i lost in the water in falling down from the ladder of ropes but i remedied this as well a i could by gathering a parcel of chickenweed which grows there in plenty and strewing it over the burtonbushes under which i sat nay at last finding my time might be longer there than i expected i tore off one of the sleeves of my shirt and lined a wooden cap that i had made of green sprigs and twisted with the green bark that i peeled off so that if i had been seen in this figure i should have appeared like a madman with the basket of a cudgel upon his head  one day coming from washing my self which i used often to do to cool me i heard a flouncing in the water and turning my head to see from whence the noise came i saw the oddest fish i believe that ever was known it had as i suppose chased some other fish very eagerly and run it self too far on the sand and the tide being almost at the lowest it had left it there it was as near as i could guess about fifteen foot long it had a head like a horse and out of the mouth came two horns curled like a rams horn only twice as large it had but one eye and that was at the extremity of the nose it seemed as it flouncd to be something of a changeable ash color with a tail that taperd to the end in a sharp point it looked so terrible to me that i was afraid to approach it as it labored it seemed to groan it lay in this hole of water half an hour with its body in and its tail out and as soon as the tide came up to it it shakd its tail to and fro as a dog does when he seems pleased all the while it felt the water it struggled but now and then and at last when the water was pretty high it turned its head and made a noise something like the clucking of a hen with chickens but louder and when it had water enough to swim away it lay moving up and down a quarter of an hour being as i suppose hurt with its struggling a gentleman of my acquaintance advised me to leave this description out for says he no body will believe it i replied i did not care for that as i was satisfied in my self it was true  i had been here now a month by my reckoning and in that time my skin looked as if it had been rubbed over with walnutshells i had a mind several times to have swam to one of the other islands but as they looked only like heaps of sand i thought i had got the best birth so contented my self with my own station boobies i could get enough who build on the ground and another bird that lays the eggs which i used to eat but i never ventured to taste of em though as their eggs were good we may suppose their flesh was so too but however i was so well satisfied with my boobies that i did not care to try experiments  this island which i was upon seemed to me to be about two miles in circumference and was almost round and on the west side there is a good anchoringplace for the water is very deep within two fathom of the shore god forgive me but i often wished to have had companions in my misfortune and hoped every day either to have seen some vessel come that way or a wreck where perhaps i might have found some necessaries which i wanted but i would often check my self in these cogitations as not becoming a christian yet they would as often awake in my mind in spite of all my devotion and other good thoughts it being natural to desire company i used to fancy that if i should be forced to stay there long i should forget my speech so i used to talk aloud ask my self questions and answer em but if any body had been by to have heard me they would certainly have thought me bewitched i used to ask my self such odd questions all this while i could not inform my self where i was or how near any inhabited place  one morning which i took to be the  th of november a violent storm arose which continued till noon when in the mean time i observed a bark laboring with the waves for several hours and at last with the violence of the tempest was perfectly thrown out of the water upon the shore within a quarter of a mile from the place where i observed em i ran to see if there was any body i could be assisting to where i found four men being all that was in the vessel busy about saving what they could out of her when i came up with em and hailed em in english they seemed mightily surpised they asked me how i came there and how long i had been there when i told em my story they were all mightily concerned for themselves as well as for me for they found there was no possibility of getting their bark off the sands being the wind had forced her so far with that we began to bemoan one anothers misfortunes but i must confess to you without lying i was never more rejoiced in my whole life for they had on board plenty of every thing for a twelvemonth and not any thing spoiled their lading which was logwood they had thrown over board to lighten their ship which was the occasion of the wind forcing her so far had they kept in their lading they would have bulgd in the sands half a quarter a mile from the place where they did and the sea flying over em would not only have spoiled their provisions but perhaps been the death of em all by these men i understood where we were viz upon one of the isles of alcranes which are five islands or rather large banks of sand for there is not a tree nor bush upon any but that where we were they lie in the latitude of twenty two degrees north twenty five leagues from jucatan and about sixty from campeachy town we worked as fast as we could and got out every thing that would be useful to us before night we had six barrels of salt beef three of pork two of pease and two of flower and eleven barrels of biscuit a small copper and an iron pot several wearing clothes and a spare hat which i wanted mightily we had besides several cags of rum and one of brandy and a chest of sugar with many other things of use some gunpowder and one fowlingpiece we took off the sails from the yards and with some pieces of timber erected a tent big enough to hold twenty men under which we put their beds that we got from the bark it is true we had no shelter from the weather for the trees were so low that they were of no use to us i now thought my self in a palace and was as merry as if i had been at jamaica or even at home in my own country i could joak now and then and tell a merry tale in short when we had been there some time we began to be very easy and to wait contentedly till providence should fetch us out of this island the bark lay upon the sands fifty yards from the water when at the highest so that i used to lie in her cabin by reason there was no more beds ashore than was for my four companions viz thomas randal of cork in ireland whose bed was largest which he did me the favor to spare a part of now and then when the wind was high and i did not care to lie on board richard white of port royal william musgrave of kingston in jamaica and ralph middleton of  these men with eight others set out of port royal about a month after us bound for the same place but those others lying ashore and wandering too far up in the country were met as it is supposed by some spaniards and indians who set upon em yet by all appearance they fought desperately for when mr randal and mr middleton went to seek for em they found all the eight dead with fifteen indians and two spaniards all the englishmen had several cuts in their heads arms breasts etc that made it very plainly appear they had sold their lives dearly they were too far up in the country to bring down their dead so they were obliged to dig a hole in the earth and put em in as they lay in their clothes as for the indians and spaniards they stripped em and left em above ground as they found em and made all the haste they could to imbark for fear of any other unlucky accident that might happen they set sail as soon as ever they came on board and made the best of their way for jamaica till they were overtaken by the storm that shipwrecked em on make shift island as i had named it when i told them of the strange fish i had seen there was not any of em but mr musgrave that had seen it and he told me when he was a prisoner in mexico he had seen one there and they called it the ram fish but he told me i was mistaken concerning the eyes for they were on the top of the head but very small not bigger than a musketball and that which i took for an eye was a hole that they sometimes spouted water through this that he saw at mexico was carried about for a show in a cart but it was but eight foot and a half in length and was by order of the viceroy sent two leagues into the bay to be buried for it stunk so intolerably they were afraid it would breed a plague  now we had all manner of fishingtackle with us but we wanted a boat to go a little way from shore to catch fish therefore we set our wits to work in order to make some manner of engine and at last we pitched upon this odd project we took six casks and tarrd em all over then stopped up the bungs with cork and nailed em close down with a piece of tarrd canvas these six casks we tied together with some of the cords of the vessel and upon them we placed the skuttles of the deck and fixed them and made it so strong that two men might easily sit upon em but for fear a storm should happen we tied to one end of her a coil or two of small rope of five hundred fathom long which we fixed to a stake on the shore then two of em went out as for my part i was no fisherman in order to see what success they should have but returned with only one nurse a fish so called about two foot long something like a shark only its skin is very rough and when dry will do the same office as a sealskin the same boiled in lemonjuice is the only remedy in the world for the scurvy by applying some of the skin to the calves of your legs and rubbing your body with some of the liquor once or twice we sent out our fishermen the next day again and they returned with two old wives and a young shark about two foot long which we dressed for dinner and they proved excellent eating in the morning following we killed a young seal with our fowlingpiece but first she was so kind to give me a blow on the forehead that cut the skin and bled very much which was done with her fins for as they run toward the water they throw backwards the gravel as horses do when they gallop hard this we salted and it eat very well after lying two or three days in the brine  the end of the first book the voyages and adventures of capt richard falconer book ii we past our time in this makeshift island as well as we could we invented several games to divert our selves one day when we had been merry sorrow as after gaiety often happens stole insensibly on us all i as being the youngest began to reflect on my sad condition in spending my youth on a barren land without hopes of being ever redeemed whereupon mr randal being the eldest rose up and made the following speech as nigh as i can remember  mr falconer and my fellow sufferers but it is to you pointing at me that i chiefly address my speech being you seem to despair of a redemption from this place as you call it more than any other of the same condition is not the providence of a power supreme shown in every accident in the life of man even you your self how much better is your condition now than you could have imagined it would have been a month ago there is a virtue in manly suffering and to repine seems to doubt of the allseeing power which regulates our actions if you seem conscious of your deserving as a punishment for any crime you have committed what has happened why do you not with a contrite heart lift up your voice to heaven and sincerely ask forgiveness of all your past offenses and that way free your self of those gross errors that are crept into your weak faith think you that the divine providence that cast jonas from the bowels of the whale has not that retentive power still left to aid and fetch us from this place  i must confess though touched with what he said i could not forbear smiling at the word retentive which brought to my mind an image very diverting in an accident that happened once to me in england since my sea adventures and perhaps one time or other i may communicate to my friends which i am sure will divert em for my living on shore for these six years last past has been as extraordinary as my adventures at sea  here pursued he we have every thing that can be required to satisfy nature we have beds to lie on and a covering from the weather we have provisions for a twelvemonth and if we should continue here a longer time we need not fear starving the very island producing wherewithal to support nature as eggs and fowls and though there is no river or rivulet of fresh water yet it rains so frequently we need not fear even that being we have vessels enough to save it in you have the least reason to spurn at providence of any one here that had only a hole in the earth to save your water which had not lasted two days longer before we very happily for you were thrown on shore is there not a providence in being thrown on land when you expected drowning before the morning dawned which happened otherwise is there not a providence in getting food when you expected to starve is there not a providence in getting fire by rubbing two sticks which you know you could not effect since though we have all endeavored at it was it not a providence that your boobies remained sweet even till the day that we came here and was it not a providence that we were thrown here which brought you all sorts of provisions i mean all that is necessary with flint and steel and other utensils and can you then doubt of a farther providence that have had all these besides even company is some allay to sorrow you were alone before and had only your self to talk too our bark is strong and firm and by degrees i dont doubt but with time and much labor to get her into the water again i have been a board her this morning when you were all asleep and examined her carefully inside and out and fancy our liberty may soon be effected i only wonder we have never thought before of clearing the sand from our vessel which once done i believe we may launch her out into deep water we have all our tackling sails and masts entire without damage i dont despair of the mercy of god in working our deliverance whose ways are past the knowledge of us poor insignificant mortals i my self have more than once been in the same or worse condition  in a voyage i made twelve years ago i suffered shipwreck and not one person saved but my self i set out from the city of cork in ireland on board a bark bound for the baltic we past the straits of elsenor and helsinburgh without meeting any thing material when one evening it began to thunder lighten and rain prodigiously the storm was so violent that we expected every moment when we should be drove on shore on the coast of sweedland or norway and be dashed to pieces the storm continued so long that all our masts came by the board our vessel sprung a leak and the water gained upon us every moment at last it overpowered us so much that we left pumping as believing it impossible to save ourselves and recommended our souls to the mercy of the lord at last our ship sunk downright and most of our men with it but i and two more had the good fortune to lay hold of the mainmast that had been cut above deck being it was sprung below and thrown overboard to prevent any danger which was tangled in some of the cordage but the ship sinking downright with the rope that was turned to the mainmast gave it such a tug that pulled it under water but afterward loosing or slipping off by good fortune it rose with two of us again but the third was never seen after the other that saved himself upon the mast was the master a man about sixty years old who held pretty well for about an hour but at last through weakness and age recommending his soul to god fell off but yet called for help and i being willing to give laid hold of him which i had no sooner done but he grasped at me and laying fast hold of the skirt of my wastcoat having never a coat on pulled me off the mast but with his weight and some struggling i made to save my self my skirt ripped off and the master sunk to the bottom and i by good fortune laid hold of the riging that hung to the mast so once more got on stride it but with little hopes of life yet doing my endeavor to save my self but with a resignation to the will of heaven at last after being tossed about for two or three hours more the end of the mast rushed with such violence against a rock as i supposed that with the shock i was thrown off but laid hold of some of the cordage again and held fast till it fixed it self in some of the craggy cliffs of the rock  by this time the tempest was very much abated and the waves not dashing so often nor so fierce i found that the mast hung on the craggy clifts of the rock which i climbed up as fast as i could least another wave should dash me against it and beat my brains out after i had got as high as i could and out of danger of the waves i kneeled down and returned thanks to the almighty for my wonderful deliverance which was wonderful indeed for though the mast beat so often against the rock yet i escaped without being so much as bruised when i had poured out the fullness of my soul to the allseeing power that had protected me from such an imminent danger i composed my self to sleep but with a calmness wonderful even to my self wonderful in every circumstance that the almighty providence should choose me out of thirty poor souls that perished in the stormy deep for a monument of his mercy i slept but yet my dreams were troubled i thought in my sleep i was cast on shore upon a barren rock where there was not a creature but my self no food nor any thing to sustain nature which proved too true i was awaked by something that licked my face which in my fright i laid hold on but soon let it go again upon finding it hairy which startled me very much and though it was still dark i could not go to sleep again for the concern i was in for fear of some devouring creature should come and seize me i listened and observed the storm was laid and the dawn approaching i began to compose my mind and to put my trust in him that had hitherto preserved me  when it came to be light enough to perceive any object i rose up and began to view the place when to my great surprise i found it to be only a large rock about half a mile in circumference as near as i could guess but the north part so inaccessible there was no getting to the top of it looking about me i saw coming fawning toward me a large bitch which was the creature had awaked me by licking my face i must confess i was surprised and pleased and made much of my new companion i hoped from it i should find some humane creatures but searching about and not meeting with any i was more grieved than before yet still i resigned my self to the will of him that sees all things and knew it was in his power to fetch me out of darkness and the shadow of death in walking up and down in a little cavity of the rock i met with seven young sucking puppies that i found belonged to the bitch my companion for she gave them suck which i stayed a little while to observe then a thought came into my head that this might be some resort for fishermen and i should very shortly see some that would take me from this desolate place  i began to search about for something to sustain nature but could find nothing but some perriwinkles and other little shellfish which i ventured to feed upon for now i began to be very hungry i wondered mightily at my poor bitch how she got food to support her self and her seven young ones i observed she used to leave me two or three times a day but returned in a quarter of an hour one day i had the curiosity to watch her but she went so fast that i could not come up to her but still i followed and at last came to the point of a rock where she went down and looking below saw her feeding upon a dead seal but how it came there i could not suppose neither could i go down the rock to see farther it being so dangerous a place when she had eat her fill she came up again and went to give her young ones suck i was mightily put to it for water though there was good quantities in several cavities of the rock but so hard to come at that sometimes i ventured breaking my neck to get it besides i could not expect that would always last for the sun was pretty warm though not intolerable i had in my pocket a knife and fork and a case of lancets but they were rusted by being wet and of no use to me for i could get nothing to exercise em on indeed my fork served me to twist out my perriwinkles  i had been here now fifteen days and nothing to feed on but these sort of shellfish yet still my strength and health continued to a miracle i slepd well though my bed was something hard it was composed of part of the rigging that came on shore with the mast which i had untwisted and pulled into oakham and laid it under an hollow part of the rock where no rain or wind could hurt me unless it blew hard south which when it did would force a little into my bedchamber  looking out one day i saw a boat coming toward my rocky island the sight raised my spirits wonderfully but observing her narrowly i found she was only driving by the wind and tide without any one in her however i got down my rock and waited for her coming on shore which she did within twenty yards of me i immediately got in her to rumage her and suprizing providence found twenty dried fish a saltbox filled with biscuit and about half a pint of brandy in a bottle after giving god thanks with great sincerity of soul i fell to and eat heartily there were two oars in the boat a boathook a small fishernet and a tinderbox with a grapling iron and rope for a cable upon this i began to be exceeding easy and thought my self to be in a happy condition i brought my fish on shore and stowed it in my bedchamber and over it for fear of my bitch put several pieces of ropes i had a tinder box and could strike a light but had no candle to burn nor any provision to dress  after i had settled every thing as i would have it i resolved to take my boat and go round the rock to see if i could discover any thing on the other side of the inaccessible part whereupon i took two of my dried fish and half a dozen biskets and put my self on board but my poor bitch came to the shore side and took on so mightily that i went and took her in i rowed half round as near as i could guess the first day but what made me so long was that in some places i was obliged to row half a league from shore to avoid some shallows which lay out toward the north east side i ventured to lie in my boat all night and the next morning went onward in my voyage and at last came to that part of the rock that i could not get over when i was a shore here i found upon the ground a nest of eggs about the bigness of a duck egg yet i could not discover what fowl owned them but i took em all away and ventured to suck one of them which i found as pleasant as a new laid hen egg here the bitch grew very uneasy and by her whining and fruitless endeavors to pass the rock which was perpendicular let me understand she wanted to be with her puppies finding nothing here for my benefit but my eggs i got on board and endeavored to go round which i did till i came to the place where the seal lay that my bitch found but it stunk abominably yet she fell to and after having eat ran up the rock and so as i suppose to her puppies i went on board again but there arose such a fog of a sudden that i could hardly see the length of the boat so rather chose to go back again than venture farther out of my knowledge which i did in a little time the sea being higher over the sand and arrived at my own habitation  i pulled up my boat as high as i could and went on shore and coming to visit my young companions found the weakest dead for want of the dam which i immediately took cut open and flayed off the skin when after being dried i made me a cap of by cutting it in form and sewing it together with some fine rope yarn that i twisted on pupose and my fork i used instead of a needle the fat served me to make candles in this manner by pulling to pieces some rope yarn and twisting it hard then i struck a light and with an eggshell heated my fat and drew the rope yarn through it so i provided my self with a new sort of candle but then i had but a small piece of match and when that should be gone i should be at a strange loss how to light my candle  finding my provision decrease i came to an allowance of a quarter of a fish a day and half a biscuit and not to touch that if i could get any shellfish which began to be scarce too for some days i could not find above ten or twelve and when i came first there i used to take em up by handfuls upon this i began to reflect that winter was approaching and consequently very cold weather and then perhaps i should not get any food i resolved within my self to venture in my boat and sail which way the wind should direct me but then i was put to it for a sail for we had cut off the yards and sails of the main mast before we threw it over board but at last i thought of a white dimitty wastcoat that i wore which was lined with linen this i unript and sewed together again so pieced the lining to the outsides and made me a tolerable sail but in the mean time the wind blew so high that i durst not venture out and continued so long that my provision was diminished to two fish which almost put me to my wits end shellfish were not to be had so at last i resolved to kill one of my bitchs whelps which i did made a fire with some boards i found at the bottom of my boat and roasted it twas palatable and eat wonderfully well they being not two months old  i dont question but you will all laugh at me when i shall tell you that it went very much against me to kill this harmless creature but my necessity had no law besides i had observed but two days before that the seal which was the dams food was gnawed to the bones in short after some strugglings with my self i killed five of the six and salted two of em for after eating my biskets out of the saltbox i found a handful or two of salt at the bottom which i made use of in that manner the intrails i boiled and gave to the dam and other puppy who eat of it heartily making no scruple though their own flesh and blood the sixth and last puppy i resolved not to kill at all if i could help it it being so like the dam and would always be with me if it could when the others would only play about the hole where they lay  in short i began to find the weather cold and so resolved to set sail in my boat with my two companions my bitch and puppy and on the  st of september after being on the rock from may the  0th i set sail with the wind about n e a middling gale and steering with my other oar for you must know my boathook was my mast and a piece of slit wood that i saved from the fire was my yard so that i could make shift to ply it to windward upon occasion but was resolved to sail before the wind till i discovered land but my boat being pretty large and my sail but small i could not make my way as i might have done with a sail fitted to the boat so that i could not discover land that night but sailed on till about midnight then i was so fatigued that in spite of my self i was obliged to lie along in the boat and fell asleep and slept till i was awakened by a fisherman in a boat whom i understood not but found by his dialect to be a dane i gave him to understand my condition by speaking and signs together which he seemed to be sorry for by beating his breast and shaking his head  he carried me ashore to a village where they made very much of me and gave me clothes but i would not stir without my dogs my boat was sold and the money gave me for my own use after i had stayed at the village three days i was carried to copenhagen to mr bridgwater the factor for several english merchants who made a gathering for me which amounted to twenty seven pounds in english money the king of denmark sent a person to me who understood english very well and took down the particulars of my voyage in the danish language that i saw afterward printed there but no one could ever fix upon the rock that i lived on one said it was such a one another such a one and some conjectured it to be a part of the main land of sweden which i should have found if i had ventured further when hindered by the fog  but i forgot to tell you that by printing this account a man came to demand his boat that he said he had lost by the carelessness of a boy to whom he had given it in charge who neglecting to fasten it on shore it drove out to sea and came where i had the good fortune to meet with it or rather guided by the eye of providence to be the means or instrument of saving my life which but for that i must have inevitably lost the fisherman that owned the boat had a new one given him in the room on it and to the value of five pounds for the things it contained  the gentleman that was ordered to take the notes mentioned above brought me a hundred english guineas collected from merchants and gentlemen of the city the king likewise ordered me a hundred more from his privy purse so that in november the   th i went on board an english ship called the happy captain john gibson commander we immediately set sail for london and arrived at debtford december the   th being christmassday      but finding things out of order in england i thought it was no place to settle in so january the  st i took horse for bristol and from thence embarked for cork where i had some small effects and happily arrived there january the   th where i was welcomed from death by all my friends  but i forgot one thing which happened to me at copenhagen dining with the gentleman that spoke english very well and several other danes i happened to drink to him in english with sir my humble service to you and asked him if he would pledge me upon which he told me i must never mention pledging among danes for added he it is the greatest affront you can put upon em how so sir says i why says he i know it is your custom in england but if you all knew the meaning of it you would surely abolish it whereupon i pressed him to tell me the foundation of that custom according to his notion why says he when the danes invaded england and got the better of the natives they used often to eat and drink together but still allowing the danes to be their masters and very often upon some pique or interest they used even to stab em when they were lifting the cup to their mouths upon the english being frequently murdered in this manner they contrived at last when they were at meals or drinking with the danes to say to their next neighbor here is to you upon which the other cried i will pledge you which was as much as to say he would be his surety or pledge while the other drank and accordingly the other would guard him while he drank when done the other would drink and then he that drank before was to stand his pledge likewise nay it came to be such a custom at last that when one englishman came into the company of several danes he would say in taking up his cup to his next neighbor will you pledge me with an emphasis upon the others answring he would he might drink without fear  after staying the winter at cork i designed to embark with captain clarke on board the ship gilliflower and accordingly we set out from cork april the   d      for boston in new england and so for virginia we arrived at boston june the  d having a quick passage after having done our business there we set sail for virginia we doubled capecod without any danger but one night a storm rose that flung us on shore upon the main within six leagues of capecharles where our men were all saved but in a poor condition our ship lying upon the sands a furlong from shore fourteen out of twenty of our men that could swim went into the longboat and went on board the ship to get some necessaries as soon as they had got what they wanted they came toward the shore again but the boat being deeply laden could not come nigh enough to shore to unload so that they resolved to go farther to seek for deeper water and bid us follow along the shore which we did but they doubling a point of land we lost sight of em however we followed on still when going over a little swamp we perceived several indidians in a wood on our right hand whereupon we began to be in a desperate fright but still we marched on when coming to the skirt of the wood they let fly their arrows at us which killed one of our companions and wounded two more one in the arm and the other in the side of the neck as for my part i still remained unhurt but had an arrow sticking in the sleeve of my watchcoat after the indians had fired they ran to us with incredible swiftness whereupon having no weapons we kneeled down to em and implored their mercy one among em spoke english pretty well who said you englishmen whitemen we will kill you to be revenged of your brothers at i amestown who kill us many indians we will take you to our werowance i e king and he will order us to burn you where we will drink your blood and feed upon your flesh they hurried us along that night at least twenty miles up in the country and next morning brought us to their village where was their werowance sick in his cabin but hearing of our coming he rose up and with several of his officers who are called cockorooses came toward us after he had examined the indians as we suppose how we were taken he ordered a great fire to be made and had us all tied to one stake fixed in the earth but we were no sooner tied and the signal given for firing the wood about us but we were untied and brought back to the tent to stay as we were informed till the next day till more indians could come to be spectators of our tragedy they had stripped us naked and in my breechespocket had found my box of instruments which they examined very narrowly and asked which of us it belonged to when they were informed it was mine i was immediately sent for before the werowance who asked me by his interpreter the name and use of every instrument which i informed him when he came to my lancets and being informed they were to bleed he asked in a great passion if i was the murderer of the indians that were taken by the english but when i let him know it was to let blood in many distempers for ease for the body and that we were strangers to those english that killed their indians he abated of his anger and asked me if i could show how i let blood which i told him i could if any one wanted it and was not well whereupon the werowance said he was not very well but he would have me try upon one of my companions before he would let me bleed him i told his interpreter that he should tell him i would feel his pulse that i might know whether twas proper to let him blood or no feel his pulse what is that says the interpreter and thought i meant something else whereupon i took him by the hand and showed him what i meant when the interpreter had satisfied him with what i said he beckoned me to him and held out his hand which i felt and found he was in a high fever i told the interpreter that he must be let blood for his indisposition was a fever and explained his distemper which he finding to agree with his condition seemed to be mightily pleased but he would have me bleed some one of my companions before him i pitched upon one that it would not injure and bled him upon the ground till he had bled enough and then tied up his arm the werowance and the rest of the indians were amazed to see him bleed such a quantity and asked me if he must bleed as much i told em yes or rather more but that i would have something to save the blood because i could make a better judgment of the cause of his distemper whereupon they brought me a callibash which i supposed might hold a quart and upon this i tied up his arm and let him bleed till i had taken about sixteen ounces from him so tied up his arm again when i had done he wanted to go into his hammock to sleep but i told him he must not go to rest till night which he complied with the next day he was much better and sent for me again from the place where they had kept us waking all night by singing and dancing round us and if any of us offered to sleep they would jogg us and hinder us when i came to him i unbound his arm and he looking at the orifice and finding it closed was more amazed than before then he made his interpreter ask me concerning his blood which was corrupted and when i told him if i had not bled him he would soon have died he got up and made me sit down upon a mat which lay in his cabin and told me by his interpreter if i would stay with him he would save both me and my companions if we would fight against the whites and marry indian women that should be allotted us i told him i would ask my companions who rejoiced at the proposals and though all married before yet they made no scruple of having another wife as for my self though not married i did not much care for such a tawny rib therefore told the werowance none of our profession ever married he being well satisfied with this answer spared all our lives for my part i had a house allotted me to my self that is a place about the height of one story with us and covered with the barks of trees the fireplace is in the middle of the house and all the chimney is the door the country is generally pretty even and agrees very well with an english constitution i need not describe the climate being i suppose you all know the nature of it as well as i all the indians that ever i saw were well limbed and near six foot high  the marriages were made the next day without much ceremony they were only joined by their priests without any question on either side and so carried home to their several tents all the while i was here they were making preparations to go against the english one day i was sent for and ordered to feel the pulse of the king after i had done he asked me if i could tell any thing of the affairs of the english by feeling the pulse but i told him that was impossible without i was with em in person whereupon the king asked me if i would go to the english and come to him again and give him a true account of em but says he you must leave your sagamore meaning my box of instruments behind you i told him i would make it my business to inform my self in every particular but that i did not know the way he told me i should have a canoe and four indians that should carry me within a league of the english i must confess i went with joy and sorrow with joy to leave such a cursed place where death threatened me every day with sorrow to go without my companions we went into our canoe which lay about six miles from the place where the king lived but took no provisions with us because my indians were to provide for me by catching of fish in which they are very dexterous we went down the river that the indians called kuskarra river till we came to chesapeackbay then we rowed in our canoe past russels islands and made toward cape or poyntcomfort but coming about a league or thereabouts near the island a boat came down the river and upon what account i cannot tell but they fired a musket which being heard by the indians they immediately jumped overboard and swam back again to shore i was not much concerned i must own for there was no danger of their being drowned for most indians swim like fishes i took the paddles and made the best of my way to poyntcomfort which i passed and entered powhattan river being directed by my indians so to do and directed my way to lamestown where i arrived very late and was mightily rejoiced to find my companions all well in health and ready to embark the next day for boston in a vessel bound for that place after refreshing my self and selling my canoe i with the rest of the company set sail the next day and after various adventures am arrived where you see me  now think with your self mr falconer whether we need doubt the providence of god in helping us from this island there is nothing here like the hardships i have undergone and yet have been happily freed from and therefore you need not despair despair is the frenzy of the mind and ought to be avoided by having a true notion of the power we serve upon this i happened to smile but was mightily checked by mr randal who asked me with a clouded countenance what i smiled at i replied his story might have had the same effect upon some old women if it were in print that the sufferings of our savior had upon a person in years what mean you by that said mr randal why ill tell you but i would not have you angry at it for i really believe every thing you have said to me but a reverend divine once at stamford in lincolnshire was preaching a sermon upon christs passion where he expatiated on the many sufferings and what our savior underwent to redeem us mortals from the curse that was laid upon us an old woman one of the auditors took the parson by the sleeve as he went out of the church and said to him indeed sir you have made a very feeling sermon which has moved me very much and more especially to ask you a question or two say on good woman says the parson pray then sir says she how long is it ago since this matter happened almost seventeen hundred years ago and how far off added the old gentlewoman a great way off some three or four thousand miles from hence alack aday cried the woman i am glad on it why so says the parson because added she it is so long ago and so far off i hope in god it is not true as to your own belief mr falconer said he i leave it to your self but i dont like jesting with sacred things the old womans ignorance was compassion your knowledge seems to be profane i have known a great many airy young fellows that have talked idly on such things to make people have an opinion of their wit but yet i believe even in the very time of their utterance their conscience told em the very doing what was not pleasing to god or man i really took mr randals way of expressing himself very kindly and as i ought for there appeared so much sincerity and candor in all that he said that it would move any one that had a sense of heaven or humane nature therefore i begged his pardon and was heartily sorry if i had said ought that might any ways offend him which he freely forgave after we had spent the night in reflection of what had past the next morning we after imploring the assistance of the almighty went to work to clear the sand from our vessel which we continued working on for    days together resting only on sunday which at last we effected we had thrown up the sand on each side down from our vessel quite to the surface of the water when it was lowest now the next thing we had to do was to get poles to put under our vessel to launch her out which we got from the burton wood but with much difficulty being we were forced to cut a great many before we could get them that were fit for our purpose after we had done this we returned god thanks for our success hitherto and on the day foling resolved god willing to thrust off our vessel into the water but was prevented by mr randals being taken ill of a fever occasioned as we suppose by his great fatigue in working to free our ship from the sand wherein he spared no pains for to encourage us as much by his actions as his words even beyond his strength the concern we were all in upon this occasioned our delay in not getting our vessel out besides one hand out of five was a weakening our strength mr randal never thought of his instruments till now which he wanted to let himself blood but not feeling them about his clothes we supposed they might have been overlooked in the vessel so i ran immediately to see if i could find them and getting up the side my very weight pulled her down to the sand which had certainly bruised me to death if i had not by the appointment of divine providence sunk into the hollow that we had made by throwing the sand from the ship i crept out in a great fright and ran to my companions who with much ado got her upright and afterward we fixed some spare oars on each side to keep her up from falling again for the pieces of wood that we had placed under her were greased to facilitate her sliping into the water and we had digd the the sand so entirely from her that she rested only on em which occasioned her leaning to one side with my weight only which had not happened i believe if i had endeavored to have got on board on the other side which was highest but choosing the lowest for my more easy entrance was the cause of the accident that happened to me when we were entered into the vessel and found our endeavors to find the box of instruments fruitless we were all mightily concerned for we verily believed that bleeding would have cured him nay even he himself said that if he could be let blood he was certain his fever would abate and he should be easier yet to see with what a perfect resignation he submitted to the will of heaven it would have inspired one with a true knowledge of the being good men enjoy after a dissolution from this painful life he was still worse and worse but yet so patient in his sufferings that perfectly amazed us all he continued in this manner a whole week without tasting any thing but water gruel ill made for what little oatmeal we had was sower when we saw by the course of nature it was impossible he should last long we all were very much grieved as for my own part i could not forbear shedding tears for i had taken such an affection to him that almost equaled a childs love to a parent he seeing me weep called me with a faint voice toward him and when i was near him he made me sit down by him after several kind expressions which made my tears flow more plentifully he said to me mr falconer if you grieve for me dry your tears i desire nothing but your prayers i am going to pay a debt incumbent on me by nature and a debt that must be paid which was contracted at my birth and death will not admit of any evasion all mortals owe the same acknowledgment but some squander away that substance which should be freely paid when called for how happy are they that provide against such a creditor that may come at any hour of day or night and lawfully demand his due here is no shuffling as in worldly matters no putting off the important visiter therefore as we are sure he will call upon us it is good to be always provided against the time how happy are honest minds when they have provided to satisfy their worldly creditors they then live in a contentment of mind peculiar to an honest heart but what must be said for the last debt upon which depends the welfare of the soul our doing well or ill hereafter is it not of the utmost importance therefore as i am endeavoring to pay that debt whose utmost limit will soon expire help me by your prayers to finish what i hope i have well begun and as friends advice prepare to make up your accounts to heaven for you know not how soon they may be called for besides you will have one less to eat of the provision is left after this being tired with speaking so much together he turned to rest himself but his fever was so violent he could take no ease in body though tranquil in mind so finding we could not expect his life we prayed for a speedy and a painless release from it after this we gave him some water which he often begged for in vain to cool his mouth when he had drank it he said he found himself a little easier and the pain and burning something abated which we took as a lightning before death or as the spirits collected together to make their last fruitless efforts  when he found himself just upon the point of expiring he made this short prayer which was so imprinted in my memory that i shall never forget it o almighty creator of heaven and earth whose allseeing eye looks into the inmost corner of the heart pardon my offenses which i heartily repent of and rely upon the infinite grace of thy wonted mercy to absolve me of all my past crimes through the merits of my lord and savior jesus christ then lifting up his hands and eyes to heaven expired with the happiness of continuing in his right senses in such a fever which is almost always attended with a frenzy  after our sorrow for his death was something abated we consulted how to bury him mr middleton and mr musgrave were for sewing him in his hammock and throwing him into the sea but mr white and my self were for burying him on the land which they agreed to so we digd the hole which i designed for my well seven foot long and seven deep and returned him to earth from whence he came upon the bark of the tree that shaded his grave i wrote this epitaph  under this tree lies the body of thomas randal gent born in the city of cork anno domini      who was thrown ashore with richard white william musgrave and ralph middleton both of jamaica to the consolation of richard falconer of bruton in somersetshire who was unfortunately cast on shore before them on the   th of of september      yet received from their conversation a mitigation of his own misfortune whose chance it is ever to read these lines pay a tear to the memory of thomas randal and endeavor to make as good an end as he did who died a natural death on friday december the   st      in his perfect mind and a true notion of the power of god to pardon all his faults whose failings were corrected by a sincere penitence dying every day he lived this took me up a whole tree mr randal made no will yet i claimed his dog being the whelp of the bitch he found upon the rock which he was thrown upon in the baltic the bitch being dead some years before we were forced to tie him up after we had buried mr randal for with his feet he would scrape holes in the grave two foot deep and howl prodigiously  after this we prepared once more to launch our vessel but first we put on board what provision we had left and all the things that we took from thence mr randals death gave me with the others permission a title to a bed which i wanted before so that i took up the cabin which was alloted me and laid on board every night and now we bent our thoughts entirely on our vessel and on monday the   st of december launched her out into the sea and designed to set sail the next day after we had fixed her fast with two anchors and a halser on shore we went on board to dine and make ourselves merry which we did very heartily and to add to our mirth we made a large can of punch which we never attempted to do before being we had but one bottle of lime juice in all and was what indeed we designed for this occasion in short the punch ran down so merrily that we were all in a drunken condition but when it was all gone we resolved to go to rest but all i could do could not persuade em to lie on board that night in their cabins yet without a bed but they would venture though they were obliged to swim a hundred yards before they could wade to shore but however they got safe which i knew by their hollowing and rejoicing  having brought my bed on board i went to rest very contentedly which i did till next morning but oh horror when i had dressed my self and going on deck to call my companions to come on board to dine which was intended over night and afterward to go on shore and bring our sails and yards on board and make to sea as fast as we could i could not see any land which so overcame me on the sudden that i sunk down on the deck without sense or motion how long i continued so i cannot tell but i awaked full of the sense of my lamentable condition and ten thousand times spite of my resolution to forbear cursed my unhappy stars that had brought me to that deplorable state o wretch that i am what will my unhappy fate do with me is any ones condition equal to mine i would cry but it is a just punishment in not rendering to god the tribute due for his mercies that we had hitherto known instead of coming on board to be frolicksome and merry we should have given thanks to him that gave us the blessing of thinking we were no longer subject to such hardships that we might probably have undergone if we had been detained longer on that island if poor mr randal had remained among us this misfortune had not happened he by his wise and prudent care and conduct would have prevented this unlucky accident what must my poor companions think that are left in a more miserable condition than my self if it be possible i have no compass neither am i of my self capable of ruling the vessel in a calm much less if there should a storm happen which are too frequent in this climate  after i had vented my grief in a torrent of words and tears i began to think how the vessel should have gone to sea without my knowledge and by remembrance of the matter the night before found by our eagerness and fatal carelessness we had forgot to fasten our cables to the geers and pulling up the halser that we had fastened to one of the burton trees on shore perceived that the force of the vessel had pulled the tree out of the earth then i too late found that a hurricane had rose when i was sound asleep and stupifyd by too much liquor and carried off the vessel this reflection wounded me deeper than before which i followed with curses on that liquor that steals away our senses and makes worse than beasts of humane creatures  now i began to call upon him that hears us in the time of trouble even when the wind blows loudest whose nod can shake the frame of earth from off its basis and with a heart sincere and vicious thoughts corrected i sent my soul in penitential words and tears before his throne of mercy imploring a speedy ending of my life or troubles when i began to be something better contented in my mind and thought of sustaining nature almost spent with the fatigue and grieving one great comfort i had of my side which my poor former wretched companions wanted that was provision in plenty and fresh water so that when i began to consider coolly i found i had not that cause to complain which they had who were left on a barren island without any other provision than that very same diet which i was forced to take up with when first thrown on shore that is the boobies whose numbers were mightily diminished before we designed to leave the island  what made me most uneasy was to think what my companions could judge of me whether they should take it for design or chance but then i stilled that thought by knowing they must needs see that the tree was forced away with violence beyond the strength of man besides i had another small comfort that was the company of my dog which lay on board with me which i used to talk to as if he were a rational creature and the poor creature would stand and stare me in the face as if he were sensible of what i said to him it was a very handsome creature of the danish kind but very goodnatured and would often go to the cabin where i lay which was that of his old masters and whine mightily  i remained tossed upon the sea for a fortnight without discovering land for the weather continued very calm but yet so hazy that i could not perceive the sun for several days one day searching for some linen that i had dropped under the sacking of my bed for i did not lie in a hammock i found an old glove with    pieces of eight in it which i took and sewed in the wasteband of my breeches for fear i should want it some time or other i made no scruple of taking it for i was well assured it did belong to poor mr randal beside i had heard the other people say that they were sure he had money somewhere and after his death we searched for it but could not find any  january the  0th i discovered a sail to leeward of me but she bore away so fast that there was not any hope of succor from her and i had not any thing to distinguish me and i supposed though i could see them yet they could not see me by reason of my want of sail which would have made me the more conspicuous the next day i discovered land about six leagues to the s w of me which i observed my vessel did not come nigh but coasted along shore but i was well assured it was the province of jucatan belonging to the spaniards and was the place we came from now all my fear was that i should fall into their hands who would make me do the work of a slave but even that i thought was better than to live in continual fear of storms and tempests or shipwreck  i coasted along in this manner for two or three days and at last discovered land right ahead which i was very glad of but yet mixed with some fear in not knowing what treatment i should have i began now to think of some evasion and not to tell em the truth of belonging to the logwood vessel but resolved to tell em that we were taken by a french privateer and after being rumagd were turned off as useless  january the  0th i made the bay and town of francisco di campeche as it proved afterward and was almost upon it before i was met by any thing of a ship or a boat but at last two canoes came on board with one spaniard and six indians who were much surpised when they understood my condition by speaking broken french which the spaniard understood they immediately carried me on shore and from thence to the governor who was at dinner they would have had me staid till he had dined but he hearing of me commanded me to come in where he was at dinner with several gentlemen and two ladies and though it is very rare any one sees the women yet they did not offer to veil themselves i was ordered to sit down by my self at a little table placed for that purpose where i had sent me of what composed their dinner which was some fresh fish and fowls and excellent wine of several sorts  the chief town of the province of jucatan lies twelve leagues from the sea on either side which is a bishops see and the resident of the governor of this province valladolid is the second city and campeche the third yet though but the third reckoned it far exceeds the rest for riches and magnificence it is a well situated neat built town and by computation contains near two thousand houses it is well fortified both by art and nature by the former in a strong well built neat castle that contains a hundred brass cannon and several mortars and the latter by a ridge of hills that runs all along the side of the city there is in the castle a very neat piazza consisting of about thirty high arches this town has the chiefest trade for from this place the other cities and towns are furnished with all necessaries that come from the havana and other places in america and likewise from old spain yet for all their power riches and strength capt parker an englishman with one ship and a small bark and whose whole crew contained but a hundred and forty men landed in the middle of the day and in spite of all their forces which were two hundred horse and five hundred foot took the place with the governor and several other persons of quality together with a rich ship laden with ingots and several other valuable ladings before they knew of the citys being taken this province of jucatan contains in compass nine hundred miles and is situated between eighteen and twenty degrees northern latitude the air is very hot and not altogether so wholesome as some other parts of america are the distempers that reign here are mostly fluxes and fevers which carry off abundance of new comers this province was first discovered by ferdinando cortez among his conquests of new spain and though not altogether so fruitful yet by the industry of the inhabitants it is as rich as any of the other provinces of new spain for they are most either merchants or tradesmen and it is the vulgar opinion that these people are more hard and barbarous than any other part of the spanish west indies yet for my own part i received more civility by em than if i had been among my own friends in england  there is a tradition here among the inhabitants that they used a ceremony much like our baptism and which had in their language the term of regeneration or second birth which they thought to be the seed or groundwork of all good and just things and after being initiated they were certain it was not in the power of the evil spirit to hurt em in body or goods neither were they permitted to marry without first taking that order upon em which they used to distinguish by an ostriches feather larger and longer than any other they usd to wear for ornaments upon their heads  they have another tradition that this province of jucatan was first inhabited and cultivated by a whitebearded people that came from the east after being tossed many moons upon the sea and suffering many hardships for want of food and fresh water and other necessaries yet relieved from want and their enemies through the power of the deity they worshipped who even commanded the sun to shine or not shine who made it rain or dry weather who could heal sickness or send distempers in short a god that kept all the other petty deities in awe  this story if true seems to confirm an old tradition of our welsh chronicles that tell us of one madoc ap owen son to guineth a prince of that country who was drove by some disgust from his own country with several companions who after various adventures at sea were driven on an unknown land to the west many hundred leagues where they had communication in a friendly manner with the indians and made a settlement whereupon madoc ap owen returned for britain again and got to the number of two thousand men and women besides children which mixed with the natives and left among em several of their opinions and manners which they retained till the last when cortez subdued em but now by the cruelty of the spaniards the natives are almost extinguished  after they had feasted me for two or three days they sent me about with several officers appointed by the governor to make a gathering which we did with success for in three days we had got seven hundred and odd pieces of eight and two merchants there were at the charge of fitting up my bark in order to send it for my poor companions when it was finished they gave me several necessaries for my self and companions to hearten us up as some bottles of fine wines two bottles of citronwater for a cordial chocolate and several other useful things but the difficulty was to get seamen to go with me at last they remembered they had five englishmen that were prisoners there and taken in the bay of campeche upon suspicion of piracy but nothing could be proved against em which they freed without any ransom this did not look like barbarity or ill nature for i received as much humanity among em as could be expected from any of the most civilized nations but they have a greater kindness for the english than they have for their neighbors the french being the english are more open and generous they say and dont use stratagems to deceive em as the french do frequently though they only pay em in their own coin for there is no nation under the sun more fruitful than the spaniards in plottings and ambuscades as they call em to deceive their enemies which yet they think lawful  on february the   th   00 we set sail from campeche bay after paying my acknowledgment to the generous governor etc but having nothing to present him with worth acceptance but my ovid i gave him that which he took very kindly and said he would prize it mightily not only in having never a one but in remembrance of me and my misfortunes  we plied it to windward very briskly and in fifteen days discovered the isles of the alcranes but we durst not go in within the shoals because we were all ignorant of the channel so we cast anchor and hoisted out our boat with two men and my self and made to shore where we found my three companions but in a miserable condition and mr musgrave so faint and weak that they expected he could not live long  when they awaked the next day after i was drove off in the dark they were all in despair to find the vessel gone which they perceived was occasioned by a hurricane that they were assured was violent because it had blown down their tent though without awaking em but when they began to consider they had no food nor but very little fresh water which was left in a barrel without a head in the tent their despair increased but as no passion can last long that is violent it wore off with their care for sustenance which they diligently searched for but not finding any quantity of eggs or boobies the dreadful fear of starving came into their minds with all its horrid attendance now they imagined that all that happened to em was as i had thought a judgment of divine providence for the vile sin of drunkenness when they should have rather implored heavens assistance in furthering em in their delivery from the place where they were  they had been now five days without eating or drinking not for want of stomachs but food which they endeavored to get but all to no purpose for the boobies were retired either out of fear or custom to some other place neither could they find one egg more and weakness came so fast upon em with hunger and drought that they were hardly able to crawl so they thought of nothing but dying when at last they remembered the body of good mr randal that had been buried a week which they dug up without being putrified and that poor wretch that helped to support our misfortunes when alive with his sage advice now was a means of preserving their lives tho dead they had by good fortune left em a tinderbox in the tent we having two with which they struck a light and made a fire then cut off several pieces of flesh of the brawn of his arms and thighs broiled em on the coals though with a great deal of reluctance which was the means of keeping life and soul together till we came to relieve em from that deplorable condition mr musgrave we brought to a little life and strength by giving him some citronwater in small quantities when i saw the carcass of my poor good monitor lie for food for humane creatures my horror at the sight overcame my reason and i believe i said things shocking enough however when i had calmly considered their condition i was very sorry for what i had said and begged their pardon after we had refreshed our selves we once more laid him in the earth having sewed his poor bones in one of the hammocks  i must confess i never think of that good man but tears come into my eyes and melancholy clouds all my thoughts for he was one whose character came up to all we could desire in frail men honest without interest friendly without design religious attended with reason and not swadled up so tite as to make it deformed pleasant in conversation courteous to all hating nothing but vice gentle in reproving bold in all dangers in being armed with an innocence that inspired him with success in short he was a miracle of a man when we consider his life had been always at sea among a crew prone to all manner of vices and where it was not possible to find a pattern to follow of any goodness  he was a single man or rather indeed a bachelor for he had often told me he could not bear to marry a woman to put her into frights and fears when the wind blew hard as every good wife must certainly be concerned for the danger of her husband besides as it was his fortune to lead a seafaring life he could not think of marrying to be absent from his other self so long as he termed it not but if he had had a sufficient competency he said he believed he should have entered into the marriage state in the latter part of life that he might have settled his mind and free from the hazard and turmoils of the sea slipped into his shroud with content among his friends and acquaintance at home  he was an excellent sailor and knew most parts of the world perfectly well understood french and spanish and seemed to have a pretty good knowledge in the latin tongue his journals were mostly taken in shorthand but he had one small manuscript containing about twenty leaves spanish on one side and english on the other all in his own hand which i suppose he had translated for his diversion or to pass away his leisure hours it was a treatise of herbs and flowers with other rarities to be found in the west indies which being but short i shall give my readers at the latter end of this piece on the flat of his book he had writ in a large hand these words this manuscript in spanish i have transcribed from the original of the reverend father pedero di riberia of the order of jesus when i was pilot in mexico the translation i have made at my leisure hours and the cures by the simples etc mentioned in the said book i have been an eyewitness to many of and some were practiced on my self but more of this hereafter  we now were got on board once again in order to sail as soon as the wind would rise it being stark calm and continued so two days but at last it blew a little and we weighed anchor and stood out to sea but made but little way i now was master or captain of a ship and began to take upon me we were in all nine men all english that is my self first richard white w musgrave and ralph middleton my old companions john stone w keater francis hood w warren and joseph meadows all of england the five men given me by don antonio who as i said before were taken on suspicion of pyracy whereupon a thought came into my head that had escaped me before i considered if these were really pirates being five to four they might be too powerful for us and perhaps murder us franc hood we had made our cook to dress our provision which he understood a little one day we all dined together upon deck under our awning it being very calm weather an awning is only a sail fixed at the quarter deck and carried over the booms that is spare masts that lie along from quarter to forecastle to the forecastle to keep the sun from our heads in men of war and great ships they have one made of several kinds of handsome stuff for the officers on the quarter deck besides another on the main deck for the common sailors one day as i said before being at dinner for we all eat together i asked the five men what was the reason they were taken by the spaniards for pirates upon this they seemed nonplusd but warren soon recovered himself as well as the rest and spoke for the others in this manner we embarked on board the ship bonaventure in the thames bound for jamaica where we made a prosperous voyage but after taking in our lading in our way home we were overtaken by a storm in which our ship was lost and all the men perished but my self and four companions who were saved in the longboat but the reason we were taken for pirates was that making to shore to save our selves we saw a bark riding at anchor without the port of campeche which we made to in order to enquire whereabouts we were and to beg some provisions our own being gone and entering the vessel found but two people in it the third jumping into the water swam on shore and brought three boats filled with spanish soldiers which entered the vessel before we could make off make off said i what did you design to run away with the vessel no answered warren with some confusion but we did design to weigh anchor and go farther in shore that we might land in the morning it being late at night but we were prevented by their coming on board us where we were found being armed which we had taken care of when we went into our boat to defend ourselves if we were obliged to land among the savages and indeed they had their arms restored em when they were freed and sent on board with me  i must confess i did not like the fellows being nonplusd now and then in not knowing what to say but upon consideration thought it might be for want of words to express himself better which is the occasion very often of people of common understanding stammering and humming and hawing to put their words in better order so for that time i took no more notice not weighing it in my mind but in the evening mr middleton came to me with a face of concern and told me he did not like these fellows tale why so says i because i observe they herd together answered he and are always whispering and speaking low to one another oh says i there cannot be any danger in em for if they had any inclination to run away with our vessel they might have done it when they were five to one before we took you in i know not replied middleton i have a heart forebodes something pshaw old womens fears said i for as i said before they would have dont when they had more power before i landed on despair island as i called it if they had any such intentions there is a providence that rules over all our actions answered middleton that we can no more see into than the book of fate but if a foreboding heart may speak i am sure something we shall suffer from these fellows that will be of danger to us if so replied i there is no resisting the will of providence for what will come will come and there is no fending against it but added he this seems something like foreknowledge and to resist against that seems like struggling against the will of heaven that warns us by these forebodings to prevent these accidents of life i believe god pursued he has fixed a period to our breath but accidents that happen in this pilgrimage of life may be avoided by a timely notice as we are all partakers of free will and from that form our own happiness or misery it cannot be said but that the actions of life may be regulated by that free will our maker never formed a villain neither does their external parts differ from a virtuous mans if they did they were to be easily avoided but as an old poet says there is no art to find the minds construction in the face  upon this discourse i began to stagger in my opinion of their honesty and therefore we resolved to stand upon our guard we took no notice of our conference then to our two other companions but resolved to stay till night we having a better opportunity being we lay together in the cabin aft which is as much as to say in the stern or behind when we were to go to supper we called one another to come but five of the sailors excused themselves by saying they had dined so lately that they had no stomach as yet whereupon we had an opportunity sooner to converse together than we designed for being at supper we opened the matter to our other two companions and they agreed immediately that we were in some danger so we resolved in the middle watch of the night to seize em in their sleep we were to have the first watch which we set at eight of the clock then they were to watch till twelve and then in their third watch between one and two we had concluded to seize upon em as they slept that is four of em for one of them watched with us which was franck hood the cook whom we agreed to seize and bind fast toward the latter end of the watch and to threaten him with death if he offered to make the least noise  as soon as ever our first watch was set we sent mr musgrave to prepare our arms in about a half an hour or thereabouts warren called to hood upon deck they lying below to get him a little water for he was bloody dry he said whereupon the other went down immediately with some water in a can to him as soon as he was gone down i had the curiosity to draw as near the scuttle as i could to hear the discourse now you must know hood our cook had been employed that day about searching our provisions our beef casks and pork to see what quantity we had that we might know how long it would last so that the others had not an opportunity to disclose the design to him as soon as he was got down i could hear will warren say to him g  d d  n ye franck we had like to have been smoked to day and though we had contrived the story that i told em yet i was a little surpised at their asking me because then i did not expect it but we design to be even with em in a very little time for hark ye says he and spoke so low that i could not hear him upon which the other said there is no difficulty in the matter but we need not be in such haste for you know as we ply it to windward a day or two can break no squares and we can soon after the effecting our design bear down to leeward to our comrades that we left on shore for i fancy added he that they have some small suspicion of you now which in time will sleep and may be on their guard therefore it is better to wait a day or two no g  d z  ds well do it too night when they are asleep replied warren whereupon there were many arguments pro and con as i fancied but they spoke so low that i could only hear a g  d d  n ye now and then and something of that kind  a little while after hood came up again and after walking up and down and fixing his eyes often upon me who in the mean time was provided with a couple of pistols under my watchcoat and indeed were their own that we hung up ready charged in our cabin which was one reason of their design to seize on us in our sleep being they had no arms till they could seize on em where they hung or else they were such desperate fellows they would have dont in the open day hood as i said before seemed to fix his eyes frequently upon me for till now i never watched in the night at last said he very softly if you please mr falconer i have a word or two to say to you that much concerns you all what is it says i why answered he i would have the rest of your companions ear witnesses too with that i called em together but says he let us retire as far from the scuttle as we can that we may not be heard by any below deck so we went into the cabin and opened the scuttle above that mr musgrave who steered might hear what was said when we were sat down upon the floor mr hood began as follows my four companions below have a wicked design upon you that is to seize you and put you into the boat and run away with your vessel but i thinking it an inhuman action not only to any one but to you in particular that have been the means of their freedom therefore i hope appointed by providence i come to let you know it that we may think of some means to prevent it upon this finding his sincerity i told him that we were provided against it already and with the consent of my companions told him our design of seizing em in the third watch but says he they intend to put their project in practice their next watch therefore i think twill be more proper for us to counterplot em and seize em this but as they have no arms says i and we have we need not fear em  we had several debates about this which took up too much time to our sorrow for warren mistrusting hood it seems got up and listened and when he found that we retired all of us to the cabin he got upon deck and stealing softly came so close that he overheard every thing we said which as soon as he understood he went immediately to his companions who waited impatiently as they told us afterward and let em know all our discourse whereupon without pausing they resolved to seize us immediately in the midst of our consultation which was no sooner resolved upon but done for we were immediately surpised with their seizing us which they did with that quickness and so unperceivably that we were all confounded and amazed they had whipped off two pistols in our consternation which they clapped to our breasts in this confusion i had forgot mine that were at my girdle or else we might have been hard enough for em neither did i remember em till they found em about me they had shut the cabin door on the inside till they had bound us and never minded mr musgrave knocking and making a noise till they had secured us which done they opened the door and seized him who came to know what the matter was for we had no candle in the cabin and he hearing a noise amongst us thought we were seizing hood and called to us to forbear as he said afterward and make haste for he was going to tack about though we did not hear him on which he clapped the helm a lee and came down to fetch us out to haul off the sheets etc and was seized and bound with us for they left us immediately being the sails fluttered in the wind by reason she was veering round when the helm was a lee  after they had fixed the vessel and it was broad day they came and unbound our legs and gave us leave to walk upon deck whereupon i began to expostulate with em particularly mr warren being he seemed to have a sort of command over the others pray says i to him for what reason have you seized upon us and bound us in this manner have we done you any injury why says he selfpreservation i found you were a going to do the like by us therefore you are but served in your kind and what do you design to do with us now you have your desire do with you why by and by we design to put you in the boat and turn you adrift but for that son of a b  h hood well murder him without mercy a dog to betray us how betray you replied i yes for i overheard all then related the manner of it as mentioned above but as you have not so much injured us well put you immediately in the boat with a weeks provisions and a small sail and you shall seek your fortune as i suppose you would have done by us no answered i we only designed to confine you till we came to jamaica and there to have given you your liberty to go where you had thought fit ay ay says warren shaking his head this is easily said nor are we bound to believe you why it is plain said i that our consulting to seize you was but to prevent what has happened we are not to enquire into the matter answered warren and now we have you in our power well do as we think fit why then says i put us ashore at any land that belongs to the english and we shall think you have not done us any injury no says he we must go to meet our captain and fifty men upon the main land of jucatan where our vessel was stranded not to be gotten off our first design when we were taken in our boat was to get us a vessel to go a buccaneering which we had done at campeche if it had not been for the indian that swam a shore unknown to us and brought succors too soon which we could not avoid the sea breeze blowing very strong all night so we seeing our danger were forced to form the lie we told the governor which had some appearance of truth for we did not use any violence to the two old spaniards being by good words we thought to make em assisting to work our bark back again to our men now pursued he if you will all resolve to go a buccaneering with us well venture to carry you to our captain and men if not well do as we have proposed we looking one upon another as if it were to know each others resolutions he cried nay if you pause you shall not have that grace if you desire it therefore prepare every thing pursued he to one of his companions that they may be going they will not be long before they come to their journeys end  when they had got every thing ready that is to say a barrel of biscuit another of water about half a dozen pieces of beef and as much pork a small kettle and a tinderbox we were better provided than we expected by much besides they granted us four cutlasses and a fowlingpiece with about four pound of powder and a sufficient quantity of shot together with all poor mr randals journals after their perusing em and finding em of no use to them when this was done he ordered em to tie hood to the mast of the vessel and was charging a pistol to shoot him through the head not considering it was charged before for it was one of them i had at my girdle and which they took from me but in his eagerness and heat of passion did not mind it we all entreated for the poor fellow and he himself fell upon his knees and begged with all the eloquence he had to spare him and let him go with us but warren swore bitterly nothing should save him says i mr warren if you believe there is a power that formed this globe and sees every action of mankind think what a crime you commit by wounding of him by murdering his image but if youre an atheist and believe in no power supernatural yet consider what a conquest you will have gained over your self by overcoming this headstrong passion it may be your own case another time and murder you know is punished with death what the devil have we got here a preaching puppy why do think that i mind thy ridiculous cant prithee mind thy own business and get thee gone or perhaps i may begin with you and send you to the devil before your time with that he cocked his pistol and levelled it at hood but firing it split into several pieces and one struck warren into the skull so deep that he was breathing his last upon deck one of the bullets grazed upon the side of my temple and did but just break the skin as for hood he was not hurt but with the fright and noise of the pistol as we supposed labored with such an agony of spirit that he broke the cords that tied him by the arms though as thick as a middle finger and fell down but rose immediately and not finding himself hurt ran to us and unbound our arms not perceived by the other two who were busy about unfortunate warren and though they were called to by him that steered who ran immediately to prevent it yet they did not mind it they were so concerned about warren and before he that steered came hood had unbound me and stopped the fellow meadows by giving him a blow with his fist that knocked him down in the mean time i had unbound white musgrave and middleton and we went and seized upon the other two pirates for now we called em nothing else after we had bound em in our turn we went to see what assistance could be given to warren where we found that a piece of the barrel of the pistol had sunk into his skull and that he was just expiring but yet he sat upon his breech with great resolution says he i see you have overpowered us and i likewise see the hand of heaven is in it i now with horror find added he that what you intimated to me about heaven to be true i see it more in this one accident than in all the preachings of the fathers i was bred a roman had good honest parents romans whose steps if i had followed would have made my conscience easy to me at this time but i forsook all religion in general and now too late i find that to dally with heaven is fooling ones self but yet in this one moment of my life that is left i heartily repent of all my past crimes and rely upon the savior of the world that died for our sins to pardon mine with that he crossed himself and expired  i must confess i was very sorry for the unhappy accident of his death but yet glad that we were at liberty and was something easy that the poor soul repented before his expiration not doubting but the piercing eye of providence saw that if he had survived he would have lived a good christian and sure the almightys infinite stock of bounty has enough mercy to save the repenting soul though late before his repentance comes  after we had secured our tartars we threw mr warren overboard and bore up to the wind for after our first tacking about in the morning when the bustle happened they bore away with tack at cathead as being for their purpose the three men that were left desired us to let em have the boat and go seek their companions which we refused as not having hands enough to carry our vessel to jamaica but we promised em if they would freely work in the voyage they should have their entire liberty to go where they thought fit without any complaints against them upon this we began to be a little sociable as before and they all declared that what they did was by the instigation of warren  the next day we discovered a ship to windward of us that bore down upon us with crowded sails we filled all the sails we had and endeavored to get away from her as fast as we could but all to no purpose we saw they gained upon us every moment and therefore seeing it was not possible for us to escape we backed our sails and laid by for em that they might be more civil if they were enemies as soon as ever they came up with us they hailed us and ordered us to come on board which we durst not deny when mr musgrave and i with hood and white for rowers went on board em we found by hoods knowing em that they were his captain and comrades now as hood said we did not know how we should behave our selves or what we should say about warren but we only told the captain how we met with his men and that they were redeemed upon my account he never asked particularly for warren but how they all did but when they sent on board to search our vessel they soon came to the truth on it for the other three told em the story though not with aggravating circumstances upon which poor hood was tied to their mainmast lashed with a cat of ninetails most abominably and after that pickled in brine which was more pain than the whipping but it kept his back from festering which it might otherwise have done because they flea the skin off at every stroke and to prevent it they wash it with brine which is called whipping and pickeling after this they would not keep him among em but sent for the other three men from our vessel and ordered us all on board with another of their men that was ill of a dangerous fever which they feared might prove infectious they did not take any thing from us as we expected at first only gave us this sick man to look after which we were very well contented with so we parted with em very well satisfied but much better when we were out of sight fearing they had forgot themselves and would send for us back and take our provision from us or one mischief or another for pirates do not often use to be so courteous  our sick man mended apace for we took great care of him and by keeping him low only with water gruel his fever left him when i began to keep up his spirits with my cordials that i had by me and in a weeks time he was pretty hoddy as we call it at sea now we began to converse with him and he seemed to be a sensible goodhumourd fellow  among other discourse we asked him how captain m  ll and his crew got a ship says he i can only tell the story as i heard it for i was sick on shore which is as follows  sixteen of our men got a paragua from the indians who hate the spaniards though under their subjection and love the french and english very well these set out to seize upon the first ship that they thought they could compass when after being five days cruising along shore they spied a large ship weathering cape catoch but believing it to be too strong for em they resolved to work by stratagem thus twelve men laid down in the boat as if very faint and weak and made a signal to the ship as if in distress who very charitably brought too now they had no arms with em for when they resolved to use this stratagem they left em ashore as making the pretense more feasible so that when they arrived at the ship they all went feebly up as if not able to stand nay some were obliged to be led forsooth to color the matter the better they then told em that their ship was cast away upon logerheads key about three leagues from cape catoch and saving themselves in their boats they got safe into the cape but that wandering up in the country they were met by the indians who used em barbarously killing eleven of their number and would have served the rest so if they had not made their escape in that paragua that they were so harrassd for want of food having been without eating two days that they feared some of their companions would never recover  the poor spaniards swallowed the bait and their captain being a very good man resolved to relieve em and asked em what they would have him to do for em they begged him to land em on the first english colony or island in their way he answered he was bound for st domingo in hispaniola but that he would put in at jamaica though something out of his way yet says he i dont care for going to any of the noted ports because there is a war talked of between england and spain and though it was not proclaimed they might meet with some trouble they were mightily obliged to him they said but they did not know how to return the obligation but by praying for him and his  they sailed very lovingly with em for three or four days till at last fortune gave them an opportunity to put their enterprise in execution they had notice that the ship leakd mightily and that the water came into the breadroom upon which the spaniards went down to remove the bread to get at the leak and did not leave more than five men and the captain above whom they instantly seized and clapped down the hatches upon the rest when they had secured them they armed themselves with pistols and lances which were placed in the steerage of the ship and so capitulated with em but first they steered their course back again that they might not lose any time as they came up one by one they bound them till they were all so but the captain and the pilot the captain they confined to his cabin with a centry to guard him but they let the pilot go loose that he might steer the ship o inhuman cried i thus the snake in the friendly bosom warmed turns and stings his kind protector thus was their generous host if i may call him so betrayed by his too much good nature  after they had brought the ship safe to us we embarked and put the spaniards on shore without a morsel to help themselves nay if the indians could conveniently meet with em they would not leave one alive i must confess pursued the man that the barbarous story shocked my very nature and made me hate their society and i really believe the abhorrence of this cursed action brought my distemper upon me  how much are some beasts acknowledgments of kindness more than man a poor cur fed but with a crust a day will follow still the bounteous hand that gives it ingratitude is the fountain of all other crimes for from thence flow all the rest but all the knowledge some men are endowed with is but to find the best way to deceive how happy it would be if such creatures could shake off their humanity and become beasts in form as well as mind then we should have a mark to shun em by our creator has formed all kind of beasts in shapes that tell us what they are but men differ in their natures more than beasts or are indeed under their human form the very natures of the brute creation how many villains under a smooth face and tongue betray their brothers the father cheats the son the son the father mothers squander the dowry of their daughters and then prostitute em to gain em bread which is not gain but punishment but ingratitude like murder meets with its punishment on earth as well as in the other world and an ungrateful man should have a mark that all human society may shun him i think the lacedaemonians used to punish ingratitude with death as a crime equal to sacrilege or parricide  after having taken all their men on board and leaving directions on a bark of a tree for the five men that were gone upon the same design another way we set sail and had not been out two days before we met with you pray says i how came you among em if you liked not their design why sir answered he by accident embarking from bermudas bound for st catherines or the isle of providence we were met by this pyrate in a ship of twenty guns and a hundred and twenty men who took us and rumaging us threatened to turn us adrift without provision if we would not embrace his designs which was pyracy we rather than undergo what he threatened us withal consented with our tongues but our inclinations were far from it and from our first being with him we were ploting to make our escape the next opportunity but the other four being but five in all in our vessel were unfortunately killed in that engagement where they lost their ship what ship was it they fought with why sir a man of war of twenty six guns sent out on purpose to take her for the captain had committed such disorders wherever he came that he obliged the governor of jamaica to send out the ship called the experiment to cruise till she met with him which she did about five weeks ago our captain as soon as he saw her guessed at her design and resolved to fight her to the last well knowing if he could take or sink her he might be pretty secure to range where he pleased there being never another ship of war nearer than barbados who never came so far west after he had made a speech to his men to encourage them to fight it out and told em their advantage they consented to hoist the bloody flag and neither to give or take quarter as soon as ever the man of war saw our bloody flag out they hoisted theirs and there ensued a dreadful fight we began about two aclock and fought till dark night without perceiving any advantage on either side and then by consent lay by till morning without fighting which we did so nigh it being calm that we could talk to one another but we did it only in threatening language as soon as the morning dawned we went to it again with more fury than before for our people fought like desperate madmen well knowing if they should be taken they must all die the other ship fought with a bravery uncommon but i believe the advantage was on our side though we had killed on board us thirty six men  we fought on till noon when we discovered a ship about three leagues to windward of us which bore down upon us with all the sail they could we soon conjectured they could be no friends to us so without much consultation we resolved to run it before the wind with all the sail we could make as for the experiment we fought with we had put it out of their power to follow us being we had shot their mainmast by the board so that if the other overtook us we should have but one to deal with we by good fortune had all our masts firm and we outsaild the other vessel but as soon as she came up with the experiment who never offered to follow us she laid by as we suppose to assist her and we observed through our telescopes that she had spanish colors out  we soon lost sight of em and then we designed to change our course but were prevented by the men discovering two foot water in the hold who could not find out the leak though they searched with all the diligence they could so we were obliged to pump but all that we could do the water still gained upon us we resolved to bear away to jucatan a province belonging to the spaniards and seek out some convenient place unfrequented by them where we might find out our leak and stop it  notwithstanding our labor in pumping the water gained upon us so we put out our longboat and our pinnace in order to put in our provision which by morning we effected and very happily for us for it was agreed upon all hands the ship could not swim above eight hours and though we discovered land and were not above six leagues off shore yet we were afraid we could not reach it being the ship was so heavy with water so all that could not swim were ordered into the two boats with their arms which held in em thirty seven men with officers they that were left on board had orders to pump as long as they could and run directly into shore to the leeward of cape catoch but within half a league off the place the ship sunk and the men betook themselves to swiming which we met with our pinnace and took up  i cannot omit one barbarous action of the captains there was five men wounded who begged to be taken into the boat but the captain refused em and this was his reason as he gave to us in the boat says he those five that are wounded will take up too much room being they cannot sit as we do but must lie along and another thing is they will take more time in looking after than we can well spare besides as i believe they will not recover they will be the sooner out of their pain and if they should recover added he they would help us to devour our provision which we must take particular care of for we know not when we shall get more i must confess this usage struck me to the heart almost especially as to one of em who seemed to have a sense of his condition and repented of all his past crimes  after we were on shore we found that we had killed on board us forty three men besides the five that our captain barbarously murdered by leaving em in the ship when she sunk two of their bodies were drove on shore the next day but were ordered by the captain to have stones tied to their feet and carried off shore and sunk as soon as we had made us two tents with sails that were put in the boat for that purpose they began to consult in what manner they should get a ship when one warren proposed to take the boat and four men beside himself with arms and a weeks provision for he would not have any more and go to the bay of campeache or campeche town where he did not fear getting a vessel for their purpose being he said he had done so upon the like occasion before whereupon the boat and four men were ordered for him but he staying longer than the appointed time they thought some mischance had happened to him so took off their thoughts of having any vessel from him one day they spied a large paragua coming toward shore with nine indians and two spaniards in it and finding it come so near that they must of course see em they immediately resolved either to take or kill em all for fear they should discover em to the spaniards before they had got a vessel to go off again  though i must confess there was some reason yet i thought it barbarous to see how they murdered the two spaniards and nine indians they put out their pinnace and ten men well armed to go and take this paragua as soon as ever they were discovered by the indians they jumped overboard and made toward shore but were shot by our men or knocked on the head with the buttend of their muskets the two spaniards had a new kind of death they tied em breast to breast and their hands behind em and threw em overboard where they struggled for some time and at last were drowned i thought this was a cruelty exceeding all the tyrants in the world and if i had had a boat and our people never a one i would have run any hazard to have saved em their paragua was laden with flower and dried fish with several sides of dried pork or bacon which was too good for the people that had it as for my own part but little of it came to my share for i was taken ill the second day after we came there and so weak and feeble that i did not expect to overcome it and if it had not been for a black that was trumpeter to the captain i should have perished for want of sustenance but the poor fellow frequently would bring me something or other to nourish me and it is to him under god that i owe my life he would often tell me that he did not love that sort of life and wished he could get rid of his master but says he if he did but know i had as much as a thought that way he would be the death of me i believe this was the only poor fellow that prayed in the whole crew he was christened at plymouth in england and had very good notions of religion where he was given to his present master who had made several voyages into the west indies for a plymouth merchant but at last finding matters on shore go but indifferently and having killed a french officer there seized upon the ship he used to command and with a crew of desperate fellows made off to sea and steered his old course for the west indies and there commenced pyrate but had met with no other success than what has been related to you  says i this fellows too wicked to have success in any thing especially when success must be an addition to his crimes if it were possible to know his fate we should find that he would have some desperate end for men when abandoned by providence divine though perhaps they may meet with some success at first at last find an end that is fitted for such wretches who deny a superior being and even atheists notwithstanding their human form are no better than brutes nay i take an atheist or deist to have far less right to salvation than those indians that pray to the devil for they do it through ignorance and worship him with a more sincere devotion because they know it is in his power to do em harm with what a fervent zeal would they serve the true god if they knew as all who profess christianity do that it is in his power to bestow blessings even after this life with what devotion they worship the sun who they take to be the superior deity because it makes the earth green and is the second cause of all the good they enjoy then with how much more reverence ought we to give praise to that power that lends light and general heat to that planet if an atheist would consider the works of nature justly he would find it an impossibility to be so any longer and to fancy this world was formed by chance or accident is to allow beasts the privileges of nature and reason to as great a degree as we that pretend to humanity  john rouse was the name of this sailor we took on board born at bermudas he offered us some proposals if we would go along with him thither but i declined it as wanting to be with my old ships crew and thought of seeing my own country again as i believe all travelers have who bring nothing home but misfortunes or the vices of the places they have traveled through from this man said rouse i had the following short description of bermudas or the summer islands  bermudas the place of my birth or the summer islands is supposed by some to take its name of bermudas from certain black hogs that came out of a spanish ship that was cast away on those shores and by others from one john bermudas a spaniard the first discoverer of the islands the name summer islands is derived from george summers an english man who suffered shipwreck there they are situated in thirty two degrees and twenty five minutes of northern latitude sixteen hundred leagues from england twelve hundred from madera four hundred from hispaniola and about three hundred from boston in new england the spaniards had it first and after them the french but the supplies that were sent em from france miscarrying by shipwreck they were obliged to abandon the islands after this one wing field a merchant in london sent in two ships captain gosnel and smith with people to settle there but there was not much done till      when a company was established at london by letters patents given by king james the first who immediately sent captain moor with sixty five men where he was two years in fortifying the islands against the attempts of any invasion from either french spaniards or indians in the mean time a sort of rats so increased that they devoured every thing that was green in the whole island and had like to have starved the inhabitants if providence had not timely sent a disease among em that consumed em all in about three years after the first plantation by captain moor there was sent em another supply of men and provision by captain bartlet who returned with a hundred weight of ambergreese the next year there arrived five hundred men and women with tradesmen of all sorts in      one tuckard succeeded in the government and was very serviceable to the plantation in bringing and planting several trees and tobacco he also divided the country into acres and parcelld it out to the tenants it increased daily in culture and inhabitants the form of the islands as they lie resembles something of a lobster with its claws off the chief of the islands is called george island and is divided into eight parts besides the general land   hamilton tribe   smiths tribe   devonshire tribe   pembroke tribe   pagets tribe   warwick tribe   southampton tribe   sandys tribe the islands are all surrounded by rocks that at high water are dangerous to strangers the chief harbors are southampton harrinton and the great sound upon st georges island they have built several large and strong forts whose chief are warwick and dover forts the soil in some places is sandy or claye and in other places ashcolored white and black about two foot deep under the ash is found great slates which the inhabitants make use of several ways and under that black is found a stony substance something like a sponge or pummicestone the wells and pits ebb and flow with the sea yet produce excellent fresh water the sky is generally serene but when it is oercast they have dreadful thunder and lightning the air is much the same as with you in england they have two harvests in the year they sow in march and reap in june then they sow in august and gather in january and from that month till may the whales frequently swim by them they often find great quantities of ambergreece and sometimes pearl oysters no venomous creature will live in any of the said islands the yellow large spiders have not the least venom in em there is plenty of all sorts of cattle both wild and tame especially hogs who have mightily increased since their first landing but they are not altogether so fat as we could wish feeding only on berries that fall from the palmetotrees which are very sweet there is plenty of mulberies both white and red which produce prodigious numbers of silkworms who spin silk of the color of the berry the trees are here of different kinds the cedar is reckoned the largest in the universe the leaves are downy and prickly at the end the berries that it produces are of a pale red which enclose four white kernels the outermost skin is sweet the innermost that contains the kernel is sharp and the pulp is tartish the tree is always flourishing being at the same time full of blossoms green and ripe fruit the berries when ripe begin to gape and fall off in rainy weather leaving a round stalk on the boughs which loses not its rind till that time two years after the berry requires one year before it comes to its full ripeness which happens about december the boughs shoot upwards and in a little time are so heavy that they weigh down the body of the tree there are many plants as the prickle pear poison weed red weed purging bean red pepper and the costive tree and the sea feather which grows on the brink of the sea there is another plant called nuchtly which grows in the niches of the rocks washed by the waves of the sea and produces a fruit like a pear which they call the speckld pear from its spots for fowls we have all sorts that england produces besides a great number of cranes larger than any i have seen elsewhere with a sort of fowl that lives in holes in the rocks like rabbets as for tortoises they are as good there as any where they catch them in this manner they watch for em at night when they come on shore to dig holes to bury their eggs in while they are doing of it they turn em on their backs and not being able to get upon their legs again they are easily taken some will have a hundred eggs in em about as big as a common tennisball and very round but a thin skin and the yolk lies on the side of the skin or shell and may be seen on the outside these hidden in the sand are nourished by the sun and never minded by the tortoise that lays em and as soon as ever they have broke the shell they all run into the sea some say they are full six years a hatching they are excellent meat for i cannot call em fish and very nourishing and we use the oil instead of butter which will keep longer and is reckoned much wholesomer for many uses besides it is good to bathe the place that is stung by a little insect called musketto the largest of these islands is long island the next st georges island after that somerset and st davids next hibernia or ireland island then longberd coopers and smiths island nonsuch gates and the brothers island with many others as well inhabited and provided with every thing for the life of man which is elegantly described by your english poet mr edmund waller  bermudas walled with rocks who does not know that happy island where huge lemons grow and orange trees which golden fruit do bear the hesperian garden boasts of none so fair where shining pearl coral and many a pound on the rich shore of ambergreese is sound the lofty cedar which to heaven aspires the prince of trees is fuel for their fires the smoke by which their loaded spits do turn for incence might on sacred altars burn their private roofs on odorous timber born such as might palaces for kings adorn the sweet palmettos a new bacchus yield with leaves as ample as the broadest shield under the shadow of whose friendly boughs they sit carowzing where their liquor grows figs there unplanted through the fields do grow such as fierce cato did the romans show with the rare fruit inviting em to spoil carthage the mistress of so rare a soil the naked rocks are not unfruitful there but at some constant seasons every year their barren tops with luscious food abound and with the eggs of various fowls are crowned tobacco is the worst of things which they to english landlords as their tribute pay such is the mould that the blessed tenant feeds on precious fruits and pays his rent in weeds with candyd plantanes and the juicy pine on choicest melons and sweet grapes they dine and with potatoes fat their wanton swine nature these cates with such a lavish hand pours out among em that our coarser land tastes of their bounty and does cloth return which not for warmth but ornament is worn for the kind spring which but salutes us here inhabits there and courts them all the year ripe fruits and blossoms on the same trees live at once they promise what at once they give so sweet the air so moderate the clime none sickly lives or dies before his time heaven sure has kept this spot of earth uncurst to show how all things were created first the tardy plants in our cold orchard placed reserve their fruit for the next ages taste there a small grain in some few months will be a firm a lofty and a spacious tree the palma christi and the fair papah now but a seed preventing natures law in half the circle of the hasty year project a shade and lovely fruits do wear and as the trees in our dull region set but faintly grow and no perfection get so in this northern tract our hoarser throats utter unripe and illconstrained notes while the supporter of the poets style phoebus on them eternally does smile o how i long my careless limbs to lay under the plantanes shade  there is now in the islands of bermudas near forty thousand inhabitants most english the laws are the same as in england the religion and divine worship the same there are three and twenty parish churches besides chapels in the year      five seamen set sail from thence in an open vessel of about three tun and after having suffered several storms and tempests were safely landed at kingsale in ireland the french and spaniards have made several attempts upon those islands but always were drove away with considerable loss  about a month before i embarked for this unfortunate voyage we took a french pyrate who was so insolent as to come into harrintons sound even at noonday and cut the cables of a merchantman richly laden bound for england but by good fortune run upon the flats in the mouth of the sound in going out again so we had time to man some boats with some of the soldiers of the garrison and send to their relief where there happened a desperate fight for some time but more forces going to the assistance of the others they took em after an obstinate resistance killing twenty seven of their men and losing eleven of our own the captain made his escape in his boat in the latter end of the engagement when he perceived his danger but was obliged to go on shore on ireland island for some provision where he and four men that were with him were secured and sent to tuckers town where they were to be tried the day i came away  two nights after we had parted with the pyrate we were encountered with a dreadful storm that lasted two days without abating and out poor bark which was none of the best was tumbled and tossed like a tennisball yet we received no damage but that she would not answer the helm so that we were obliged to let her go before the tempest and trust to the mercy of heaven for relief this storm and the danger we had escaped from the pyrate put me in mind of these four lines of the forementioned poet the celebrated waller  bold were the men which on the ocean first spread their new sails when shipwreck was the worst more danger now from man alone we find than from the rocks the billows or the wind we in the middle of the storm discovered land right a head which put us all into our pannicks we endeavored to bring our vessel to bear up to the wind but all to no purpose for she still drove nearer the shore where we discovered several tokens of a shipwreck as pieces of broken masts and barrels swiming on the water and a little farther mens hats then we began to think we should certainly run the same fate when as soon as thought our bark was drove on shore in a smooth sandy bay but where we had opportunity to quit her which was happy for us for the sea washed over her with such violence we had not any hopes of her escaping the storm but thought of course we should be torn to pieces  when we were ashore we all concluded it could be no other part but the south of cuba island belonging to the spaniards we were then in a terrible fright lest we were near any part that belonged to the indians for mr musgrave assured me that there were some parts of the southside of cuba that indians dwelt in in spite of the spaniards and massacred them wherever they met em or any other whites we lay all night in terrible fear and though we found the storm abated or rather a calm succeeded yet we durst not stir till the moon rose and then we all walked toward our vessel which we found all on one side but by good fortune most of our provisions was dry which mightily rejoiced us but all the vessels riging and masts were shattered and torn to pieces and some part of her quarter wrung off that she could not be of any use to us if we could have got her upright but we took out all our provision and our arms with two barrels of gunpowder that was dry the rest being damaged with water and sand that had got in we had arms enough as having them that belonged to the three sailors that were taken in the pyrate which we supposed they had forgot so we were six men well armed with each a musket a case of pistols and a bayonet beside two cutlasses if need were  by that time we had taken every thing out day approached and then we designed altogether well armed to go and view the country john rouse was very well recovered of his fever but a little weak yet his heart was as good as the best of us so we resolved if we were set upon by indians to defend our selves to the last drop of blood choosing rather to die by their hands in fight than to be tortured after the manner as they inflict upon all the whites they get into their hands but still we had some hopes that we were too far toward the northward for em  when we had placed our provision and other necessaries safe behind a tuft of trees that grew close by the water side we fixed our arms and ventured to walk up in the country which we did almost every way that day four or five miles but could not discover any living creature nor any sign of inhabitants only in one place the grass seemed to be lately trodden but whether by man or beast we could not discover so being pretty well tired we went back again to our station where we eat heartily and at night we laid our selves upon the grass and fell asleep for we durst not lie upon the sails we had got for that purpose being they were not dry though spread all day long  i was awakened the next morning by a company of lizards creeping over me which is an animal frightful enough to look at but very harmless and great lovers of mankind they say that these creatures if a person lies asleep and any voracious beast or the alligator which comes on shore often is approaching the place where you lie will crawl to you as fast as they can and with their forked tongues tickle you till you awake that you may avoid by their timely notice the coming danger i got up being rowzd by these animals and looked about me but saw nothing but an odd kind of a snake about two foot long having a head something like a weesel and eyes fiery like a cats as soon as it spied me it ran away and my dog after it but he did not kill it but i believe put it in a terrible fright for it made a noise something like a weesel but louder which awakened my companions when i told mr musgrave what i had seen he said it was a small serpent but not very hurtful called the guabiniquinaze serpent from eating a little creature of that name something resembling a small mole and the indians and spaniards eat of em and reckon em dainty food  we now resolved for another walk to discover what inhabitants were our neighbors whether indians or spaniards if indians we designed to patch up our boat which had several holes in it and make off as fast as we could and row northward till we came to some place inhabited by spaniards but if we found the latter to beg protection and some means to get to jamaica whereupon we ventured out with these resolutions we met with several fine large cedar trees and one particularly so large that mr musgrave and i could but just fathom it with our hands joined  we had not gone far before my dog began to bark when turning my head on one side i beheld a black approaching toward us and being startled at the sight i cocked my piece and resolved to fire at him but he called to me in english and told me he did not come to do any harm but was a poor distressed englishman that wanted food and was almost starved having eat nothing but wild fruit for four days upon that i let him come near where he was soon known by mr rouse to be willam plymouth the black that was trumpeter to the captain that commanded the pyrate ship upon his knowing him we sat down and gave him some provision which we had brought with us because we designed to be out all day  after he had refreshed himself a little we asked him how he came into this island why answered he we were cruising about cuba in hopes of some spanish prize when a storm arose and drove us upon a rock where our ship was beat to pieces and not above eighteen men saved beside the captain and did that wicked wretch escape the shipwreck yes answered plymouth but to undergo a more violent death for says he as soon as ever we landed we wandered up in the country to see for some food without any weapons but a few cutlasses having lost our first arms but however we all got something or other to defend our selves on shore as long clubs which we got from the trees we found in our walks our captain resolved if he met with any indians or spaniards huts that he would murder all that he found in em for fear they should make their escape and bring more upon us thus he encouraged his men to follow him with their clubs says he we will walk till we find foam beaten path and there lie hid till night when we may go on to some houses and come upon em undiscovered by which means we may get provision and other arms for the indians of cuba use firearms as well as the spaniards and are full as dexterous in using em as any europeans etc after traveling about ten miles to the n w we discovered a path upon which a halt was commanded and to retire in to the woods again till night which we did and dined upon what fruits we could get upon the trees  about two hours before night a dog smelled us out and running away from us barked most furiously upon that we were afraid of being discovered which fear proved true for in half an hour or thereabouts after the dog left us we were saluted with several arrows and musket shot that killed us three men and wounded me in the foot but it proved the means of saving my life for as soon as our men perceived what had happened they ran as hard as they could to meet the danger as knowing they could do no good till they came to handyblows i in endeavoring to follow em found my hurt which prevented my keeping up with the rest but i could hear and see em at it there was about two hundred indians set upon our men and in about half an hour killed em every one i saw the captain lay about him desperately but at last fell being run through the throat with a wooden stake as soon as ever they had conquered em or rather murdered em they fell to striping of em as fast as they could and carried em off together with their own dead which were many for the english sold their lives very dearly  after they were all gone which i sound by their screeming and noise at a distance i ventured to steal out from behind a row of bushes where i had placed my self to see what had happened i went to the place of battle where i found two of our men that they had left with all their arms and some of their own so i took up one of their best muskets and a cutlass and made farther into the wood for fear of being caught which i had certainly been if i had staid a quarter of an hour longer for i soon heard em come hooping screaming and hollowing back to fetch the other two bodies and their arms as i conjectured  i walked as far as my hurt foot would let me that night and out of danger of the indians as i thought and then laid me down to sleep as well as i could being very hungry and sadly tired and slept pretty well till morning when i proceeded forward in my painful journey and directed my course n e thinking that was the best way to avoid the indians and probably to meet with some spaniards whom i knew inhabited toward the north the havanna the capital city of the whole island being seated there i wandered for four days eating nothing but fruit in the woods but laying my self down about an hour ago to rest my self a little i thought i heard the tongues of englishmen which to my great joy proved true i left my musket behind the bushes for fear of alarming you but now after returning god and you thanks for this timely nourishment i will go and fetch it which he did and we might easily know it to be an indian piece for they had rudely carved it all over with several figures of birds and beasts  now said i to my companions you see the reward of wickedness he was not suffered by providence to go on long in his crimes though some are that are inured to ills yet they are overtaken at last when their crimes are full blown for though justice has leaden feet yet they always find he has iron hands and we too often see that he who kills his adversary in a duel though he escape the law one time or other meets the same fate himself  after poor plymouth had refreshed himself we set forward and walked along till we came to a road that seemed to be a main road of the island by the largeness here we consulted what we should do whether we should go on or return for more provision but we resolved to go a little distance from the road for fear we should meet with more of the indians and run the same fate with the other englishmen but plymouth told us we were a great way from that place where his countrymen were killed for plymouth though born in guinea would always call himself an englishman as being brought over very young so we resolved one and all to venture  we sent up our prayers to the almighty for our safety and went on with a faith that we should come off with success but we had not gone far when we heard the reports of several muskets and shouting in a barbarous manner behind us looking that way we saw a mulatto riding as fast as ever his mule could carry him when he came up to us he stopped and cried in spanish make haste run for the indians are coming upon you they have killed several spaniards already and they are fighting with them mr musgrave who understood spanish very well interpreted what he said to us he asked him how far they were off he answered just by and hearing another shout put spurs to his mule and left us in an instant we found by the shouting and the firing that they would be immediately upon us so we retired out of the road to let em pass and laid down upon our bellies that they might not discover us immediately came by about twenty spaniards on horseback pursued by near a hundred indians just as they came by us one spaniard dropped and crept into a bush on the other side of the road and presently the indians followed shouting in a horrid manner and overtook the spaniards again who being very swift on foot outrun an ordinary horse and they had thrown away their firearms to make them the lighter to run as we supposed the spaniards knew they would soon overtake em so only run to charge their pistols and stand till they came up then discharge em to put em in confusion and run again to prolong the time in hopes of some aid all this we understood by the spaniard that crept into the bush undiscovered by the indians by reason of the horses feet and the dust together he being the foremost in flight he told us moreover that about three leagues farther there was a fort belonging to the spaniards to stop the indians they using to make inroads before that fort was built even to the gates of the city havanna upon this we consulted and resolved to follow upon the edge of the road to see how we could be assisting we soon came even with em for they were in a narrow place and the spaniards kept em at bay pretty well by good fortune there was a high hedge made by trees all along as we went which hindered us from being discovered here we resolved to fire upon em all together and then run further up and if possible get out into the road and face em accordingly we agreed to fire four and three and the first four to charge again immediately mr musgrave mr middleton mr white and my self agreed to fire first then hood rouse and plymouth which as soon as we had taken good aim we did and firing at their backs killed four downright and wounded several for i had ordered em to put two bullets into each piece as soon as ever we had fired our muskets we let fly one pistol each and then the other three fired their guns as soon as plymouth had fired he ran and charged our four guns he having never a pistol and then we let fly our other pistols with these discharges we had killed at least fifteen indians and put the rest into such frights that they began to run for with the dust and bustle they made they could hardly distinguish from whence the fire came neither did they stop till they met with the poor wounded spaniard who had crept out hearing the discharge of our pieces as we supposed they fell upon the poor fellow with shouts and outcries and tore him to pieces never minding the spaniards pursuing em who cried miracalo miracalo a miracle a miracle by this time we got within twenty yards of the end of the hedge where we seven fired our muskets and left em to plymouth to charge then we ran in upon em with our pistols and discharged em close upon em with this last fire we dropped em twelve men and they screamd out and ran away as fast as they could we did not think fit to follow em for it was not to any purpose being they were soon out of sight we charged our guns and pistols again and the twelve spaniards did the like they having nine in the last conflict killed and two desperately wounded they gave us thanks for our rescue and said we were surely sent from heaven to their relief they let us know they were taxgatherers for the king of spain and were obliged to go in numbers and well armed for fear of these desperate indians who about nine years ago set upon em and killed eighteen of em and but two escaped but never met with any molestation from that time till now so that this time thinking the danger over we lessened our number from fifty to thirty which i suppose the indians having notice of was the occasion of their setting upon us they said it was to no purpose for to go back for the rest of their companions that were killed which being a mile of they had taken with em  we had not gone above half a league onward but we heard dreadful shoutings as before and looking behind us it being a strait road we could perceive a cloud of dust and the indians running full speed toward us upon which we put down our two wounded men that were on horseback and mounted upon the spaniards spare horses now we being nineteen horsemen resolved to stand it we divided into ranks four in a rank which made five ranks only there was but three in the last rank so we resolved to keep directly one behind the other and when the first file had fired to fall in the rear and charge again the spaniards would make up the three first ranks as they said they could not in honor expose us to the first onset being we ventured our lives in coming to their assistance we had no time to dispute for now they were just upon us and to our surprise had several fire arms among em as soon as they got within a hundred paces of us they fired but not above two of their pieces went off the rest were clogged with dust in running that very happily for us hindered their discharging the shot missed us by providence and we would not give em time to charge again but we moved forward and fired in upon em and did great execution when it came to our turn to fire we in the heat forgot our orders but after we had discharged our guns and pistols we fell in with em with our cutlasses and being raised above em by being on horseback did great execution and that with the spaniards charging and firing again put em to the rout but now we followed em being on horseback and dispersed em so that it was impossible for em to rally any more that night however we took four of em prisoners and tying their hands behind em fastened em to two of our foremost horses the rest following after that they might not get loose  we were met in the road by twenty spanish horse with each a footsoldier behind em who were upon the full gallop to our assistance being alarmed by the mulatto that rode by but i believe some were glad they came too late the officer and the rest saluted us very courteously when they heard how luckily we came to their assistance but fell a whipping the poor naked indians so barbarously that though they deserved it i could not bear to see it done in cold blood and though the blood followed every lash yet they never cried out this is the chief cause of the hatred of the indians when ever the spaniards get any of em in their power they put em to all manner of torture but if on the contrary they would use em civilly and discharge em now and then i am sure they might live in perfect friendship with em for the indians are goodnatured loving and affable till they are incensed and then they are implacable  we arrived at the fort about evening and were very well entertained the officer did not doubt but to procure us a ship to transport us to jamaica though they had orders from havanna to secure all english vessels there being a war talked of between the spanish and french and english and dutch the next day the officer mightily bragged of being an old spaniard that is born in spain and of an ancient family and mr musgrave made us very merry upon the road in interpreting the dons speeches we found all along from the fort a great many gentlemens houses pleasantly situated and the country all along yielding delightful prospects  we were well entertained at a gentlemans house at dinner with provisions dressed after the english way and all manner of sweetmeats and cool wines the gentleman had a vault or cellar thirty foot deep under ground he spoke pretty good english and had been a factor several years in london and knew our customs and manners very well and preferred our way of dressing victuals before their own he had an english cook from a tavern behind the royal exchange that he brought with him into spain and from thence to cuba where he had a vast estate left him his cooks name was hodges a good understanding fellow and made very much of us and would fain have had us to stay with his master longer but as soon as we had dined we were obliged to get on horseback and away for the havanna which we reached about six aclock in the evening we had rooms alloted us and several english and irish men came to see us that lived there  havanna is the capital city of the whole island of cuba and has as great a trade as any place belonging to the spaniards in the west indies it has one of the finest harbors in the universe not for its greatness but its security yet able to contain five hundred ships of the greatest burden the mouth of the harbor is commanded by a platform and a square fort fastened together by a strong boom or iron chain that no ship can enter the most shallow part of the whole harbor is eight fathom water and all its banks is paved round with flat stone so that a vessel of a thousand tun may lay her side to it and unlade just between the two forts there stands a round water tower where they discover to the town how many vessels are coming toward the harbor by putting out a flag for every ship this place is the best fortified and garrisoned in all the indies to secure the plate fleet and all other ships that meet here to set sail altogether for spain this city is very large near as big as bristol in england and the houses are handsomely built but after the spanish fashion there are two handsome churches fine and well built with spires and an organ in each besides several chapels and a foundatien laid for a third church while we were there this city almost as soon as it was built was sacked by a french pyrate in the year      who was driven thither by a tempest and landing his men well armed took the city in spite of all their resistance and burnt many of the houses they being most part wood and had consumed em all had not the spaniards redeemed the rest by paying em a thousand ducats upon the receiving of the money they made out to sea and the same evening came into the havanna three ships from spain who hearing of what had chanced prepared to follow em taking several soldiers on board em the admiral who sailed best got the first sight of the frenchman but being fearful to attack him before the other ships came up lay by the frenchman seeing that boldly set upon the first ship and took her without fighting the second seeing that tacked about and ran ashore which was taken by the ships boat the third also run the same fate flushed with this success they returned to the havanna the second time and exacted a thousand ducats more or else they threatened to level the city with the ground which was paid em immediately then they took their last leave with this rich booty and sailed for rochel in france where they shared their prizes after this they built their houses with stone as they are now which nevertheless the english took about twelve years after  there are many fair harbors besides the havanna in cuba as that of st jago city and harbor which is a handsome place seated on the south of the island and is also a bishops see under the archbishopric of st domingo three leagues from st jago lies those famous copper mountains called by the spaniards sierra de cobre there is another town and harbor situated on the eastern part of cuba called baracoa where they gather the best ebony of all the indies there is many other good ones as st salvador trinedad puerto del principe which has a fountain near it that some times of the year produces liquid pitch  cuba was formerly divided into eight provinces and governments and better peopled than any other island in america before the spaniards invaded em but now there are but few indians which inhabit several parts of the island unmolested by the spaniards but the natives can never forget their barbarity which they have by tradition from father to son nay i have been informed that they keep a solemn festival once a year which was the time that the massacre of the indians happened and if they can get any spaniards they sacrifice em to satisfy the manes of their dead ancestors  hugh linscoten the french voyager relates that a cassick or one of the lords of a province caught a spaniard at their first landing and threw him into a river to see if he would drown which he did and that satisfied him they were not immortal whereupon he encouraged his men and repulsed the spaniards several times with great loss but at last run the same fate with the rest of the natives it is reported that the spaniards first and last had massacreed sixty thousand indians in the island of cuba  la casas a bishop in new spain that wrote the history of the indies tells us this story of another cassick that was taken by the spaniards in cuba and condemned to be burnt alive with green wood that his torture might be the longer and more exquisite while he was tied to the stake before the fire was lighted a friar that was present preached to him the truth of the christian religion and that all who died in that faith and trusted in god that formed the earth and all the creatures therein should immediately after their purgation ascend into heaven the residence of our creator there to converse with angels and such as died in that faith but on the contrary if they persisted in ignorance and died in a contrary opinion they should descend into hell and live in an eternity of torments upon this the cassick asked him if there were any spaniards in heaven and being answered there were many then says the cassick let me go to hell for i would rather converse with those you call devils than you spaniards in heaven for i am sure you are far the worst of devils and take delight in nothing but tormenting us though the fryars preaching was certainly true yet men of any reason must conclude that no religion can be propagated by cruelty and the sword which was always the spaniards method with the indians wherever they came and all their excuse was that if they had not used them in that manner they could never have made their conquests being they were forced to lessen em for fear their numbers might overpower em so that in short as dryden says in his conquest of mexico by the spaniards you threaten peace but you invite a war  i met here with a priest that i am sure harbored nothing of cruelty in his breast for he came to see us every day and in such a friendly manner that charmed us all he was always sending us one good thing or other and would take us to divert us abroad he understood latin very well and some english on the sunday he preached an excellent sermon in spanish as mr musgrave informed us whose chief heads ran upon us and to excite charity in his auditors to let us have what was necessary in carrying us to jamaica the next day he brought us to the value of fifty pound in spanish dollars which were collected at the church doors for us there was a small vessel of about forty tun upon the stocks that was bought of the owners for us and a collection made in the town for money to pay for it we told em of the provision we had left on shore which by our computation could not be above twenty leagues off but they told us it would be difficult to find it one day a spaniard met us walking with father antonio in one of the cloisters of the convent and reprimanded him for favoring heretics as he called us so much he thought none of us understood spanish so was more free in his conversation says father antonio we ought to use charity even to brute beasts and much more to our fellow creatures who wear with us our creators image i would not be thought to make a schism in our religion which i am sure is the holiest and most pure but yet i cannot consent in my thoughts that all who are out of the pale of our church must suffer damnation it would be horrid to think it and would take away from the luster of our opinion which shines so brightly if they are in any errors concerning their belief god in whose breast it lies can open their eyes when he thinks fit that they may see those errors then added the spaniard with the same reason you may say the indians and natives may still remain in ignorance till heaven shall think sit to open their eyes as you say and if so the missionary fathers may spare their trouble no replied the father we are there appointed by providence to bring em out of the cloud that dims their sight but of people that own christ and serve the same god with us who differ but in a few outward forms of worship it is very hard to believe that those instructed in that worship must inevitably sink into damnation i cannot tell what the spaniards thoughts were upon this discourse but i am sure he was more charitable than before for he pulled out of his purse a moidore and gave father antonio for our use which it seems he had refused to do when he went about collecting for us after he was gone he told us his discourse pro and con and what he could not make out in english mr musgrave cleared to us from the others telling him in spanish what he meant  the end of the second book the voyages and adventures of capt richard falconer book iii we were told our vessel was ready and therefore might be going when we pleased it was a very neat one as ever was built by the spaniards and carried between thirteen and fourteen tun  we had all sorts of provision sent on board for half a year or more so that we only stayed for the wind to rise it being quite calm  while we stayed there the four unfortunate indians were to be executed in the midst of the parade they were first to be dragged by four horses naked along the great street to the parade and then to be chained to a post fixed for that purpose and burnt to death i must confess when i saw with what barbarous cruelty they designed to use em i repented my being an instrument in the taking of em this execution was ordered to be between seven and eight in the evening being then it was coolest all the indian slaves that served spanish masters in the town were ordered to go and be spectators of the tragedy that they might see what they must expect if they ever offered to rebel in the like manner when the time came the whole street was crowded with a vast number of people of all conditions but such a sight i never desire to see again each indian was tied by the feet to the harnass of the horse and so dragged from the prison to the place of execution upon the bare stones naked their arms tied upon their breasts and fastened upon their backs that they might not lift em up to save themselves as they were dragged along the stones but by that time the poor creatures came to the parade their skin of their legs thighs and back were almost stripped off yet without the least complaint as soon as they were tied fast to the stake they took from a pot of liquid pitch boiling hot a stick with something fastened to the end on it and rubbed over their naked bodies one of them then i observed began to faint but was rated by another of his fellow sufferers in their own language which none understood but indians and the fellow seemed to bear it much better before the fire was put to the pile a friar stepped up to them and in spanish spoke to the indian that was ready to faint before who had been servant in the town but run away from his master and understood spanish the friar desired em if they would be happy in the other world to acknowledge themselves christians and go out of the world in that faith upon this the indian answered when i lived among you said he and was taught to worship your god you told me he was an upright god and a just god to them that served him faithfully but an avenging power to those that once offended him if so how comes it to pass that he has not punished you for all your crimes you have taught me that whoring and adultery were sins not to be pardoned and yet you commit those sins as if you were in no fear of any punishment murder is one of your commandments not to be forgiven when at the same time you will hire a bravo to kill a stranger that looks but wantonly on your wives in short i know not any one thing that i have heard preached to us poor indians that you practice your selves therefore if your spanish god be as you described him to us the curse must fall upon you if we cannot believe in him being we are detered by the cruelties you inflict upon us in serving him as you would have us when we find your actions and words differ more than our complexions you preach up holiness and righteousness but you practice debauchery and lewdness  he said more which was to excite the indians to rebel but they put a stop to it by putting fire to the wood which being composed of several combustible matters soon consumed the poor wretches  when all was over father antonio took us home to his lodgings to give us a small collation for the last time being the next day we did all design to lie on board in expectation of the winds rising we told him by mr musgrave that we thought it a great weakness in them to preach in that manner to indians in their condition and it would be apt to make others despise their religion says mr musgrave it is like courting a woman to love by stripes pardon the comparison why says father antonio i must confess it is not what any of our fathers like but it is what we are ordered to do and therefore must not be denied besides at first it was a piece of barbarous policy in the first conquerors of the indies they would order the missionaries to preach to all indian criminals but out of hearing of any spectators so as soon as they were executed they would declare to all the indians that they died christians and were happy mr musgrave asked him what made them use em so inhumanely was it not enough that they suffered death but must be tortured in that barbarous manner he replied it was done to terrify the other indians from any violence mr musgrave answered that was certainly wrong for as they are an implacable sort of people and have handed down to them from father to son the first massacre though almost two hundred years ago they must needs remember these cruelties of so fresh a date which revives in their memories the former if they had any mind to forget em he could not say much to it he said but evaded the discourse by bidding us be merry that is innocently and disoffensively so for he did not allow of disorders in any one so we refreshed our selves and took our leaves of the good father who blessed and embraced us and said he would pray to heaven for our prosperous voyage so on the next day we paid our hearty acknowledgments to all our benefactors and went on board where we had not been a quarter of an hour before an extraordinary message came from the governor for plymouth our black who went with them without any hesitation and returned with a present from the governor of several bottles of rack spanish wines fowls rice and brandy with twenty pieces of spanish gold as the messenger told us in recompense for the loss of one of our companions for the governor had sent for plymouth to know if he would serve him in quality of his trumpeter and he would settle a pension upon him for life plymouth thought fit to accept of it as having no master nor knowing when he should have one but he got leave to come on board to bid us farewell which he did in a very affectionate manner i bid him have a care to please the governor and then he need not fear doing well so we parted with plymouth with our hearty thanks recommended to father antonio for all his favors plymouth had a trumpet given him by the governor as soon as he came on shore which he brought with him and sounded all the way in the boat as he went back again to oblige us for really he sounded extraordinary well and had learnt on several other instruments having a tolerable understanding in music we were sorry to part with plymouth as being a faithful honest fellow yet glad he had got so good a master the wind rising we weighed anchor and left the port with three huzzas and a volley of small arms we having no cannon and in two days lost sight of the island cuba  this famous island of cuba which was first called joanna by columbus the first discoverer afterward fernandina then alpha and omega as being the first and last island the spaniards touched at but afterward was called cuba and still retains that name this is reckoned one of the four islands of the barlovento the others are hispaniolo jamaica and portorico the north side of cuba is fortified with a vast number of small islands called the lucaies which some geographers have taken for a part of the main land the chief is bahama which forms the gulf of florida the passage that all ships go through when they come out of the west indies into europe  cuba has on the north jucatan a province on the main land distant about  0 leagues and on the south jamaica about  0 leagues in length   0 and in the broadest part about    the soil in most parts that are inhabited by spaniards is fruitful and much more healthy than hispaniola the tobacco is reckoned the best in the spanish west indies i have seen very large vines there which bear excellent grapes but not fit to make wine many have tried but it turns sour in a few days and for birds beasts and fishes it comes up to if not exceeds any of the other islands the bird flamingo is a fowl something bigger than our ordinary geese but legs and neck twice as long and all over red and generally go in a body at a distance they look like a company of soldiers marching the spaniards have a proverb here that the time will come that english men will walk as freely in their streets as the spaniards do now if it were so it would be of a prodigious advantage to the english being the havana is a strait that commands all the ships that come out of the indies for europe and i really think from what i have seen that it would be in the power of ten thousand men with a fleet proportionable to overcome the whole island in a little time besides it is observed that there are more prizes brought into the havana than any four havens in the indies  while we were at the havana a spaniard carried two strange beasts about the streets for a show that he brought from brazil the one was called ai with a head something resembling that of a mans and covered with rough short gray hair each foot has three claws close together about a finger long very sharp teeth with a smooth high black nose very small sleepy eyes and no ears with a tail small above and broad at the bottom with hair all over the body of an ash color this beast is about the size of a large fox but so lazy a creature that when it gets up a tree it never comes downtill it has devoured every leaf and when it has done it will sit there twenty days together without eating and almost starved before it will take the pains to go down to feed it cannot travel or creep in a whole day not above a quarter of a mile this that was shown to us never would stir till roused with a stick and it would be asleep again in an instant  the other creature was something like a baboon but considerably larger with a face and long beard like an old mans and hairy like a goat all over the body his ears bald his eyes black large and sparkling he that showed it to us called it a cayon its tail is about four or five foot long which they twist round a tree and so fling themselves to the next they are very fierce and subtle and when wounded will set upon their adversary without any fear and if forced to climb the trees they carry their mouths and hands full of stones to throw at travelers as they pass by and when wounded they set up a shriek that immediately brings all of their kind within hearing to their succor who stop the wound with leaves and moss which will soon be healed this that we saw was brought up very young by the person that had him and would play many comical tricks as he was shown to us he urind in his paw and threw it in our faces before we were aware and while i was a wiping mine he gave me such a salute with his tail that made me stand farther off which seemed to please him mightily for he looked at me and chatterd as much as to say i have given it you the spaniard told us they used to play at a certain game with the natives for money and would often win and then go spend what they had got upon a liquor that made them drunk and as soon as they found themselves so they would retire very decently and take a nap by which they were very often caught  joseph de acosta that wrote the history of the west indies in spanish tells a story of one of these sort of creatures going to a tavern with a pot and money to pay for his wine yet would not part with his money till they had filled his pot with the wine but in the mean time beat four or five boys that did their endeavor to take it from him and carried it safe to them that sent him  peter martyr relates another story of one of them that seeing a spaniard going to fire a gun at him snatched up a little child that was there and held it before him as a buckler and would not let it go before the spaniard was retired then he laid the child gently down and ran away after having first urind upon it  the fellow that showed them sold em to the governor of havana for two hundred dollars and would have gone with us to jamaica or any where but we durst not take him without an order from the governor who does not suffer any one to go out of the island without a pass from him which costs a dollar and brings into his purse a great deal of money in the year having no other revenue from the king of spain only so much a year for a table and a palace ready furnished with every thing that is necessary besides servants every ship that comes in pays two dollars and at going out four more so that the government of this island exceeds in its profit any other government except the vice roy of mexico in the spanish west indies  the weather continued favorable so that we arrived at jamaica without meeting any thing remarkable in our passage as soon as we had cast anchor i ordered the boat to be made ready to carry me on board my own ship which i saw ride there but when i got up the shipside i found my clothes selling at the mast at who bids more which is the method as soon as a person is dead or killed the first harbor they anchor in the clothes of the deceased are brought upon deck and sold by auction the money to be paid when they come to england for it generally happens that sailors have not any till they come home again  they were at the last article when i came up the shipside which was a pair of black worsted stockings that cost i believe about four shillings which went at twelve and sixpence though they had been worn as soon as i was seen by em some cried out a ghost a ghost and others ran away to secure the clothes they had bought suspecting that now i would have em again when they were satisfied of my being alive and were told my story they were all rejoiced at my good fortune but none would be prevailed upon to let me have my clothes again so i took up the slopbook and cast up what they were sold for and found that what cost me about twenty pound were sold for four times the money when i was satisfied in that i called every person one by one that had bought any of my clothes and struck a bargain with them for ready money and bought them for about ten pound but the ready money pleased them mightily  captain wase being sick ashore i went to pay him a visit where he was mighty glad to see me as believing i had perished he told me that the vessel hung lights out for several hours that i might know where to swim and laid by as long as the wind would permit as the crew acquainted him when they came into harbor the captain told me that he did not think he should live long therefore was mighty glad i was come to take charge of the ship which had sailed before if he had been in a condition to bear the sea from thence i went on board my new bark and settled my affairs there with my companions who were mighty sorry to think of parting with me hood and rouse desired they might be received on board as sailors and go for england with us for hood was an englishman i mean born in england and rouse had friends there besides it was as easy to go from england to bermudas as from jamaica so i spoke to the captain who was very well pleased to receive them being he had lost five men by the distemper of the country the poor captain died in a week after my coming and left me executor for his wife who lived at bristol  as soon as we had buried him i went on board with my two men and did design to sail in three days at farthest which i would have done before but that i was hindered by wanting a chapman for our bark being we had shares to dispose of when i came on board the master told me he had no occasion for the two men to add to their charge says i that is as i shall think fit for the power is in my hands now and who put that power into your hands says the master he that had the power so to do says i the captain whereupon i showed him in writing he told me it did not signify any thing and that he would find no one of the sailors would obey a boy incapable to steer a vessel says i i dont desire to have any command over you but only to represent the captain that is deceased we have no want of any representatives replies the master and you shall go in your own station or not at all it would be a pretty thing added he for my mate to become my captain and as i was designed by the captain to have the command of the vessel before you came so i intend to keep it but says i this paper signed by his own hand is but of two days date and you cannot show any thing for the command as you pretend to therefore says i i will make my complaint to the governor and he shall right me ay ay do so says he i will stand to any thing he shall command whereupon rouse hood and my self went into the boat again and rowed immediately on shore but the governor was six miles up in the country and it being pretty late we designed to wait for his coming home which we were told would be in the morning early so i went on board the bark and laid all night the ship lying beyond the keys two leagues from the harbor in order to sail the next morning getting up with an intent to wait upon the governor and looking toward the place where the ship lay over night found she was gone and casting my eyes toward sea saw a ship   or   leagues distant from us which we supposed to be ours i immediately went on shore and found the governor just come to town and made my complaint he told me there was no remedy but to send immediately to blewfields bay where he supposed they would stop to get wood which was usual with our ships that were bound for england whereupon there was a messenger ordered for blewfields which i accompanied to give instructions to the officer that commanded at the fort to seize the master of the ship and order him before the governor at port royal so we got on horseback and reached it in three days it being almost a hundred miles when we came there we found several ships in the harbor but none that we wanted so we waited a week but all to no purpose for she past the bay as mistrusting our design upon this we were obliged to return with a heavy heart and tell the governor of our ill success who pitied me and told me he would see me shipped in the first vessel bound for england so i went on board my own bark where they were all glad to see me though sorry i was so disappointed now i was very glad that i had not disposed of my bark for i thought now it might be of use to me we consulted together to know what was best to do at last i made a bargain with them if they would venture with me in our bark to england i would give them not only my share of her but as much money as came to the other two shares if they would be willing to part with them upon this we agreed and with what money i had i began to lade my vessel with things to traffic with i bought a good quantity of indigo some cotton sugar and rum in short i laid out the best part of my money and on june the  st   00 set sail and steered our course for england  before i leave jamaica i think it will not be amiss to give some account of the dreadful earthquake that happened there in      i am sure it is a true account of it being it was wrote by the rector of portroyals own hand who was upon the place when the accident happened you shall have it in his own words  june         dear friend from on board the granado merchant in port royal harbor i doubt not but you will hear both from garrets and briss coffeehouse of the great calamity that has befallen this island by a terrible earthquake on the   th instant which have thrown down almost all the houses churches sugar works mills and bridges through the whole country it tore the rocks and mountains and destroyed some whole plantations and threw them into the sea but port royal had much the greater share in this terrible judgment of god i will therefore be more particular in giving you an account of its proceeding that you may know what my danger was and how unexpected my preservation on tuesday the   th of june i had been at church reading prayers which i did every day since i was rector of port royal to keep up some show of religion amongst a most ungodly and debauched people when prayers being ended i went to a place hard by the church where merchants use to meet where the president of the council was who acts in chief till we have a new governor came into my company and engaged me to take a glass of wormwoodwine with him as a whet before dinner he being my very good friend i stayed with him upon which he lighted a pipe of tobacco which he was pretty long taking and not being willing to leave him before it was out i was detained from going to one captain rudders where i was to dine whose house upon the first concussion sunk into the earth then into the sea with his wife and family and some others that came to dinner with him but to return to the president and his pipe of tobacco before it was out i found the ground rolling and moving underneath my feet upon which i said to him lord sir what is this he replied very composedly being a very grave man it is an earthquake be not afraid it will be soon over but it did increase every minute and we heard the church and tower fall upon which we ran to save our selves i quickly lost him and made toward morgans fort which being a wide open place i thought to be there more secure from the falling houses but as i made toward it i saw the earth open and swallow up a multitude of people and the sea mounting in upon us over the fortifications i then laid aside all hopes of escaping and resolved to make toward my own lodging and there to meet death in as good a posture as i could but i was forced to cross and run through two or three narrow streets the houses and walls fell on each side me some bricks came rolling over my shoes but none hurt me when i came to my lodging i found all things in the same order i left them in not a picture of which there were several fair ones in my chamber being out of it is place i went to the balcony to view the street in which our house stood i saw never a house down nor the ground so much as cracked the people seeing me there cried out to me to come and pray with em when i was come into the street every one lead hold on my clothes and embraced me that with their fear and kindness i was almost stiffled i persuaded em at last to kneel down and make a large ring which they did i prayed with them near an hour when i was almost spent with the exercise they brought me a chair the earth working all the while with new motions and trembling like the rolling of the sea insomuch that sometimes whilst i was at prayer i could hardly keep my self upon my knees by that time i had been half an hour longer setting before em their many and heinous sins some merchants came to me who desired me to go aboard some ship in the harbor and refresh my self they told me they had gotten me a boat to carry me off coming to the sea which had entirely swallowed up the wharfe with all those goodly houses on it most of em as fine as those in cheapside and two entire houses beyond it i upon the tops of some houses that lay level with the water got first into a canoe and then in a long boat which put me aboard a ship called the siam merchant where i found the president safe who was overjoyed to see me i continued there that night but could not sleep for the returns of the earthquake almost every hour which made all the guns in the ship to jar and rattle the next day i went from ship to ship to visit those that were taken up in boats bruised and dying and to pray with em also to do the last office to them in saying the form of prayer that is used at the burial of the dead which has been my sorrowful employment ever since i came aboard this ship with design to come for england we having nothing but shaking of the earth thunder lightning and foul weather ever since and the people being so desperately wicked it makes me afraid to stay in the place for that very time this terrible earthquake was as soon as it was night a crew of lewd rogues which they call privateers fell to breaking open warehouses with intent to rob and rifle their neighbors whilst the earth trembled under them and some of the houses fell on em in the act and those that remain still in the place are as impudent and drunken as ever i have been twice ashore to pray with the bruised and dying persons and to christen their children where i met too many drunk and swearing i did not spare em nor the magistrates who have suffered wickedness to grow to so great a height i have i bless god to the best of my skill and power discharged my duty in that place which you will hear from most persons that come from hence i have preached so seasonable to them and so plain in the last sermon i preached in the church by setting before them what would be the issue of their impenitence that they have since confessed it looked more like a prophesy than a sermon i had i confess an impulse to do it and many times i have preached in the pulpit things that i never meditated at home and could not methought do otherwise the day when all this befell us was clear affording not any suspicion of the least evil but in the space of three minutes about half an hour after eleven in the morning port royal the fairest town of all the english plantations the best empire and mart of this part of the world exceeding in its riches plentiful of all good things was taken and shattered to pieces sunk in and covered for the greatest part by the sea and will in a short time be wholly eaten up by it for some of those buildings that yet stand and are left we every day hear fall and the sea daily incroaches upon the town we guess by falling of the houses and opening of the earth and inundation of the waters that there are killed fifteen hundred persons and many of good note of whom are my good friend attorney general musgrave martial reeves william turner thomas turners brother is lost i have lost the best living that ever i had or shall have i came as i told you aboard this ship in order to come home but the people are so importunate with me to stay i know not what to say to them i must undergo great hardships if i stay here the country being broken all to pieces i must now live in a hut and eat yams and potatoes for bread which i could never endure drink rum punch and water which were never pleasing to me i have wrote as effectually as i could to my lord bishop of london to send a younger person who may better endure the fatigue of it than i can now it would look very unnatural in me to leave the people in their distress and therefore whatever i suffer i would not have such a blame lie at my door i have acquainted my lord of london that by reason of the present distress i am willing to continue a year longer they are going to build a new town near the rock in liguinea the garden of the island the french from petigauies did attack the island on the north side but were all defeated and destroyed it being near the time of the earthquake  june         ever since that fatal day the most terrible that ever i saw i have lived on board a ship for the shaking of the earth returns every now and then yesterday we had a very great one but it seems less terrible aboard than on shore yet i have ventured to port royal three times since its desolation among the shattered houses to bury the dead and christen their children sunday last i preached amongst them in a tent the houses that remain being so shattered that i durst not preach in them the people are overjoyed when they see me amongst them and wept very bitterly when i preached to them i hope by this terrible judgment god will make them reform themselves for there was not a more ungodly people upon the face of the earth it is a sad sight to see such a fair harbor covered with the dead bodies of the people of all conditions for our great and famous burial place the pallisadoes was destroyed by the earthquake and the sea washed the carcasses of those that were there buried out of their graves their tombs being dashed to pieces by the earthquake of which there were hundreds in that place many rich men are utterly ruined whilst many by watching opportunities searching the sunk houses even almost whilst the earthquake lasted while terror and amazement had seized on all the considerable persons have gotten great riches we have had an account from several places of the island of mischiefs done there by the earthquake from st anns we hear that above a thousand acres of woodland are washed into the sea carried away whole plantations in diverse places but none suffered like port royal where streets were swallowed up by the opening of the earth the houses and inhabitants went down together some of them were driven up again by the sea which arose in the breaches of the houses wonderfully escaped others were swallowed up to the neck the earth shut upon them and squeezed them to death and in that manner several are left buried with their heads above ground only some heads the dogs have eaten they are covered with dust and earth by the people which yet remain on the place to avoid the stench thus i have told you a long and sad story and god knows what worse may happen yet the people tell me they hear great bellowing and noises in the mountains which makes some very apprehensive of an irruption of fire if so i fear it will be more destructive than the earthquake i know not how to stay and yet i cannot tell how at such a juncture to quit my station  yours etc  i believe this was the most terrible earthquake that has ever happened since the creation of the world and did more damage they tell a story of a wicked fellow that in the time of the earthquake ravished a merchants daughter and after murdered her that he might not be discovered but a black that happened to be in another room and hearing what had happened ran away to the ship where her father was to give him notice that he might come and apprehend him but when he came and found his daughter murdered and the villain gone he was almost distracted and the house tumbling with the earthquake he perished in the ruins bemoaning his daughter the execrable wretch was soon overtaken with divine vengeance for going to make his escape a large stone from one of the falling houses dropped on his back and broke it where he was taken up in such misery that he prayed for some one to knock him on the head to put him out of his torture the pain was so violent that it took away his senses and in the height of his raving discovered himself to be the author of the horrid fact mentioned but he died without repentance cursing every body  another story that was told me was that a gentlewoman had come out of the country to lyein there being she would be better accommodated and was brought to bed but two days before the husband was gone out and at the first shock of the house all her servants left her with the infant with her which with the violence of the shock was overturned in the cradle with this accident the gentlewoman in a fright rose out of her bed though in a weak condition and took up her child and feeling the house totter ran down stairs in her shift with her infant in her arms where she was met by her husband who took her in his arms to carry her away just as the house fell upon them all where they were drawn out but the child was dead and the mother died in half an hour the husband mightily bruised with much pain lingered out to the next day and then expired and were all three buried together in one grave  one abraham matthews an inhabitant of port royal that was alive when i was there told me of a remarkable providence that happened to him as he was packing up several things to carry on board some vessel that was in the harbor for the more security he had no sooner come out of the house where he lodged but it fell down and smothered several people within just as he got to the waterside the boat was going off and as he put one foot into the boat the boatman pushed him out again and told him he must stay till he came back being the boat was full the boat in turning the point by the fort was overwhelmed by a point of the shore which fell upon it and all that were in it perished this was the second deliverance when he saw what had happened he retired to the church which was open to return god thanks and beg his farther protection or if death happened he could not choose a better place to die in while he was at prayers he saw one of the buccaniers or thieves stealing away his bundle which he immediately followed seized and took it from him as soon as he was out of the church that fell to the ground when he had got the bundle he kneeled upon the earth to tie it faster the adjacent house sunk down also and smothered the fellow with several others that were in it going a little farther he met some of his acquaintance who were getting a canoe ready to convey themselves on board a ship in the harbor where he safely arrived and gave god thanks for his many and happy deliverances  we put in at blewfieldsbay for the convenience of wood and water and when we were provided steered our course onward for england but as we came within ten leagues of the havana a spanish man of war of forty guns came up with us who commanded us to strike our sails which we did immediately and coming on board us were surpised to find us all englishmen not expecting other than spaniards from the building of our vessel whereupon they made us all prisoners and sent fifteen men on board us to carry the vessel into the havana telling em how we came by the vessel did not signify any thing for they said we were pirates and had seized it and our pass which we had from the governor of the havana not being to be found made things appear but with an indifferent face we were afraid we should find many difficulties in getting our liberty especially if they went to their station which was st jago but it happened better than we expected for she made directly to the port of the havana where we knew every thing would be placed in a true light again when we were anchored and the people could come on board us we were soon known and the captain going to the governor was soon informed of the matter so we were released immediately and had a visit made us from father antonio and honest plymouth who were mightily rejoiced to see us  we were detained two days before we could get away and then we set sail with a brisk gale first saluting the town with our   guns and   patteraroes which i had forgot to mention our buying at port royal  in two days after our first sailing we made cape florida and entered the gulf that bears the same name and passed it without danger but here a sudden calm overtook us as frequently happens when your past the gulf and the current set strong to westward occasioned as we supposed by the opening of the land upon that coast the calm lasting for four days and we were insensibly carried within half a league of the shore but a little breeze rising from land helped us farther out again but still our danger more increased for we soon perceived three large canoes making toward us full of indians armed we had not much time to consult what to do for they gained upon us every moment now death or something worse than death glard us in the face and most of us thought this the last day we had to live come friends said i if we must die let us die bravely like englishmen to die is just as common as to live only life is choice but death we still pursue and every step we take shortens our journey if then we follow death why should we fear it or if we should fear what would that avail since fearing cannot put back the fated hour then let us like those that would dispose of somewhat do it to the best advantage we charged our   guns with double and round and our patteraroes with musketballs the rest of our arms we got in readiness and resolved to die fighting and not suffer our selves to be taken to be miserably butchered as all the indians of florida do when they get any whites in their power we resolved to fire our six muskets upon em as soon as they came within reach so we took our aim two to each canoe and fired upon em which did em some damage for they stopped upon it which made us make the best of our way but they soon pursued us with loud and rude shouts by this time we had charged our muskets again and fired as before at the same distance but whatever damage we did em they came on as fast as they could but not before we had charged our pieces the third time which we fired as before but did more execution as being nearer to us and now we charged em the   th time and laid them along upon the deck for a farther occasion for they being so nigh that our great guns would reach em with our double and round which we fired one at a time the first we fired at was the largest canoe which put them in such confusion that they fell foul of one another and being in a huddle together we fired the other three that made a mighty havoc among em we now thought of a victory instead of being made slaves and bore up to them that we might make our patteraroes of use to us which we fired upon em with patridge or musket shot that answered our end for now they began to turn tail which we seeing fired our muskets the   th time which killed them two indians and charging our great guns with single balls of   pound weight or   pounders as they call them at sea and firing at their boats or canoes we sunk one of them but the men swam to the other canoes and taking hold of the sides with their weight turned it over mr musgrave and the rest of our men advised to make up to them and in this confusion kill them all but i was satisfied with the disappointment they had met with and as it was not in their power to hurt us farther resolved to make the best of our way but looking toward the shore saw eight more of their canoes making up to us this put us upon making all the sail we could and the sea breeze being now pretty strong we made good way we thought the canoes would stay when they came up with the other three but they made after us a long with the those indians that they had taken up we had charged our great guns with great shot and fired at them but mist them we charged them the   d time and one shot by good fortune took the first canoe and overset her which put them into more confusion than before but still five of them pursued us which were met with by some of our musketballs that gave two of them their quietus est and firing our great guns once more sunk one of their canoes but the men soon got into the other and followed us still seeing this we resolved to make one strong effort and make the best of our way so we backed our main sail and laid by for em and brought our four guns to one side and our   patteraroes to bear accordingly we charged our muskets once more and laid them in readiness with two half pikes and our cutlasses and now we resolved not to fire till every gun might do execution we staid till they came within two ships length of us and then we fired upon them as fast as ever we could which proved effectual for we killed em at least twenty upon which they set up dreadful uncommon noises and rowed back as fast as ever they could we gave them our farewell musketshots and made the best of our way by a moderate computation we killed them at least  0 indians without their once firing at us neither could we conceive how they intended to assault us or whether they had any fire arms for we saw none after we had brought our vessel to rights again we assembled our selves to prayers and returned our sincere thanks to the defender of the weak and giver of all good things for our happy deliverance we saw the canoes padling toward shore and were met by several others with a design as we suppossd to assist them but we were now too far for them and there was nothing more to be feared and so we sailed on with a prosperous gale and met with nothing worth note till thursday july the    th we discovered land which amazed us all for we did not think of falling in with any shore till we saw england we went to consult our charts and saw we were near newfoundland and finding that we steered directly into st johns harbor which is the capital of the island i mean of that part which belongs to the english the harbor is large fair strong and commodious commanded by several good forts and a strong boom that shuts it up the town consists of about  00 houses built after the manner of the houses in england  newfoundland or terra nova was discovered by sebastian cabot for king henry the vii of england this island is seated in    of northern latitude and divided from the continent by an arm of the sea about  0 leagues over it is larger than ireland the climate is much the same as in england very wholesome has several commodious harbors the english possess one part and the french the other but the english are more populous this island is of great benefit to the english as well as other nations from the vast quantities of fish that are caught upon the banks of newfoundland this is a very large bank of sand which extends a hundred and twenty leagues to the west near the continent and about  0 leagues broad in the middle and sharpens to each end it is reckoned the most extraordinary thing found in the sea of that kind for ships may anchor though twenty or thirty leagues from land the fruits are the same with us in england and the soil so very rich that it will bare pease beans etc without tilage which are as good as any in england the beasts the same only the bear which is found there in short newfoundland resembles england in every thing so much that if a man could be carried from thence in his sleep he would only think he was strayed somewhere out of his knowledge there is only this to be said that there is not so many inhabitants so there is more plenty of every thing for human life their chief trade is fish but they send great quantities of musk sables and other furrs there is not one indian to be found upon the whole island but what are brought from other countries and used as servants though it is reported about  0 years ago toward the northwest parts the french met with some indians that used to help them to cure their fish and make their oil they describe them a civil sort of people but no knowledge of a superior deity and when attempted to be taught they would answer we are well contented with our own god neither do we desire any other why should we offer to change we think our forefathers wiser than we are and they worshipped the same with us therefore as we think of going to the same place where they are we must worship the same power you have your god and we have ours every nation must have a god according to their own language should we pray to your god in our indian language how should we be understood or should you pray to ours what would it avail you being he would not know what you said to him now we have not one god only but many as one for fishing one for fowling and another for husbandry and when we are about any of these particular buisinesses we pray to that god for it would be too much for one to mind them all would it not seem ridiculous for one of us if we wanted success in hunting to pray to him that takes care of fishing or you that wear clothes would you go to a fisherman to bid him cloth you you tell us there is a vast number of worshipers of your god in all countries than what need you any more we will serve you as well and as faithfully as if we had but one god and pray to our gods to give you success in whatever you undertake if you fish well pray to that god if you go to fell timber well pray to that and so on to whatever you employ your selves in when you are out of their dominions you must pray for your selves to your own god in short there is neither fair means or foul will ever bring these poor creatures to the knowledge of the true god if you are angry with them they will comply with you and say well well we will do as you would have us but never think of it afterward if you reason calmly with them than the answer you as above  after being here two days we set sail and made our course for england july    th   00 we met with no extraordinary accident in our passage till we discovered the lands end august the    st how rejoiced i was to see my native country let them judge that have been in the same condition as i have been and i may with truth say that the transports felt in first seeing the white cliffs of the island that gave me birth exceeded the joy i received when i was delivered from the most imminent danger here we consulted whether it were better for us to go to london or to bristol but every one allowed london to be the best mart for our goods so we made for the thames and the weather being fair and a brisk gale we anchored over against shadewell dock now all that we had to do was to get chapmen for our goods i applied my self to a merchant upon change who soon struck a bargain and with the consent of my companions sold the lading bottom and all for nine hundred and twenty pound reckoning the lading seven hundred pound which was my own and two hundred and twenty for the vessel and every thing besides they were all contented with their dividend but still resolved to go with me to bristol to see after my affairs there so we set out on foot intending to walk it and be a little merry upon the road for we expected more diversion by walking it leasurely than going in any other manner i had turned all my money into bank bills which amounted to  00 l with my money that i had for my goods and sewed them in the wasteband of my breeches not that there could be any danger being so many in company we took the salisbury road though something out of our way being i resolved to carry my friend to bruton the place of my birth comeing through basingstoke a sailor met us begging charity for gods sake i gave him sixpence which he returned me many thanks for i asked him how it came to pass that a lusty sailor as he was did not go to sea especially now war being talked of between the english and french he answered he was going to london for that intent but was obliged to be beholding to good mens charity to assist him in his journey why pursued i have you no friends your clothes are good you dont seem to have begged long no answered he this is my first day i made an end of the little money i had last night have you been long from sea says i but a week i had the misfortune to be cast away in sight of harbor from whence came you asked i says he we came from jamaica and were bound for bristol but a violent storm over took us within six leagues from the mouth of the river severn and drove our ship upon some rocks in the mouth of the bay and all the men perished but my self from jamaica says i pray what ship the albion frigate replied he who was your captain added i the captain died at jamaica but the master supplied his place one jacob bingley did you ever hear of one falconer yes he was the mate supposed to be lost in a voyage he made to the bay of campeachy but coming safe into harbor afterward the captain before his death gave him the command of our ship but the master not approving of such a young man to have the power over him set sail without him this i learned on board afterward for i and another sailor were hired for the voyage that afternoon before the morning we set sail we had but an indifferent passage the whole voyage which was made up with nothing but storms and calms that caused a great deal of uneasiness and our provision received damage by the salt water which drove us to the last extremity and when we were raised in our hopes of setting our feet upon our native country we were devoured by the tempestuous waves i my self was taken up for dead upon the shore by a fisherman have you any friends says i at london none replied he every place to me is home a sailor is never out of his way if so return with us to bristol where we are bound and i will promise you if i cannot get you a ship i will give you where withal to carry you to london without begging we easily agreed upon the matter and honest tarr went on with us i asked him why he did not endeavor to get a ship at bristol he answered he would rather choose to go in a man of war than a merchant man since war was approaching and he heard there was a fleet fitting out for the west indies and if so says he there may be some hopes of getting something there either of jack spaniard or jack frenchman we came to bruton and took lodgings in the magpyeinn where i visited all my acquaintance and from thence we went in the same manner to bristol where the first thing was to enquire after my poor father but i was informed by captain pultney that he thought he was certainly dead though he had seen him but once since i had been abroad and that was in the january before when he came privately to him and told him he was settled in a small village near hereford and went by the name of hawkins what convinces me he is dead is that about two months ago he sent me a letter which i will show you he went up stairs and fetched it which contained these words  sir when i had settled my self in my little tenement i began to think of turning farmer that i might have some employment to pass away the tedious hours of my voluntary banishment but going the other day to view a hollow place where we had our marl to marl our ground the earth on a sudden fell upon me and i was scarce taken out alive my back broke and bruised all over in a pitious manner this is the first day of rest or ease that i have had from my intolerable pain it is allowed and i am very well satisfied that i cannot survive it pray be kind to my dear dick if he ever lives to come home if not what i have deposited into your hands let it remain with you for your own use since my daughter is provided for if i should against the expectation of every body recover you shall hear from me very soon if not believe that i am returned to earth from whence i came i hope i need not caution you once more to be kind to my poor boy if he should return and be a father to him comfort him amidst his affliction and restore to him what i left with you with a dying parents blessing that he may be as happy as his wretched father was miserable which is the hearty desire of your friend and servant  falconer   grief so overcame me for a time that i was not able to speak to be robbed of a father and a father i loved so dearly was a cutting stroke and i was constrained to make use of all my young philosophy to support it my father had left the writing of his estate with captain pultney he having only mortgaged it before for five hundred pound to a friend to prevent its being seized on by the crown which was redeemed by the captain by my fathers appointment when he came to see him last i paid him his five hundred pound and would have given him interest for it but he would not accept of it but advised me to part with it without i designed to settle in england which i thought was the best way whether i staid in england or not the captain undertook the matter and sold it for four thousand pound but whilst he was busy about it i got mr musgrave who was always my bosom friend to go to hereford and if it twere possible to find where my dear father was buried and to see how matters stood there accordingly we hired a couple of horses and set out when we arrived at hereford we found it not a little difficult but at last through the means of one mr hall organist of the cathedral church we had sight of the place which was about half a mile from the city mr hall came by the knowledge of it by the means of an honest clergyman that my father had contracted a friendship with before that unhappy accident befell him that deprived him of his life he brought us to his house where the gentleman was laid up with a fit of the gout as soon as we were private i let him know who i was upon which he tenderly embraced me and was mightily joyd to see the son of his late friend says he i should have been at bristol ere now but that the gout prevented me your father was a man i had but a short acquaintance with yet that little time discovered him to be a man of integrity honesty and honor when he was upon his death bed he told me his real name and circumstances and what misfortunes had brought him to this part he told me also that he had a son at sea and begged of me to dispose of his little fortune he had here and see it put into the hands of captain pultney of bristol which i had done but was prevented as i said before by this sudden fit of the gout i have taken care of all your fathers effects and the little farm i have bought my self it being for my turn upon that he sent his maid for a little box which he unlocked and told me out two hundred guineas this is what your father left in ready money behind him his farm etc i rate at two hundred and fifty pound more there are the writings and there is the money by the writings i saw it cost my father but two hundred pound as for his apparel and other little necessaries i gave them by his order to a maid servant and a man that he hired and for his goods there is but few nor have we made an estimate of them but if you will have them praised i will give something more than what they are valued at being i would willingly have them along with the house says i neither shall they be parted and if you please to except of them be they what the will you shall be heartily welcome he refused them obstinately but i prevailed with him to take them with much ado he also gave me a ring which i prized mightily because it had been my fathers from his infancy given him by my grandfather when he had settled every thing i went to see the place where my fathers bones were laid which filled me with such awful sorrow that i could not refrain from weeping in spite of my resolution to the contrary i would have erected a tomb or monument for him but it was his last request that he might be buried as obscurely as he did design to live there  after parting with my fathers grave with a load of sorrow we took leave of my friend the parson and mr hall and rode for bristol again but were overtaken about six miles from hereford by three gentlemen of the pad that had got some notice of the booty they should gain if they could rob us for i was so inadvertent as to put all my money into my bags which i wore before me at my saddle they past us first but looking wishfully upon us gave us some suspicion of what they were mr musgrave advised me to ride back again and stay still we had more company but i told him they would soon overtake us and seeing us fearful would make them more resolute so i rather chose to face them for we observed they were returning to meet us we resolved to be before hand with them and we drew out our pistols ready and if they offered to come too near us to begin with them as soon as they came within  0 yards of us i called to them and asked them what they wanted if it was our money they should first take our lives they answered they had no such intention than what is your reason of passing us first and then meeting us again they answered one of their companions in lighting to ease himself below the hill had dropped his watch and they were returning to find it if they could why then pass by in the name of god says i and accordingly they did but we were cautious of letting them come too near us as soon as they were past us we set spurs to our horses and got over the heath before we looked behind us but riding leasurely through the village we saw them coming after a full gallop now we repented we had not stayed in the village but we resolved as before to encounter them if they assaulted us the soon overtook us and coming even with us told us their companion had found his watch which he pulled out and showed us they said they could not blame us in taking them for highwaymen but they assured us they were travelers as we were and were going to worcester we did not make any words with them but rode along with them indeed because we could not help it they rode with us for about a mile and then the road going narrow one of them pretending to go foremost seized hold of my bridle with the surprise my horse being a very good one rose up an end and he discharging his pistol the ball grazed upon my cloakbag and did not do any farther damage upon this i fired one of my pistols but missed him but i threw it at him with all my force which hit him on the head so full that he staggered a little and fell from his horse the other discharged a pocketpistol at me and wounded me slightly in the left shoulder but going to discharge another i set spurs to my horse and had the good fortune to snatch it from him but in the bustle between us it went off and shot the other highwaymans horse in the head which so enraged him that he ran away with him in spite of all he could to stop him mr musgrave who engaged with him followed him but considering he had left me with two returned again and in very good time for the other fellow that i had knocked down with my pistol had got up again and had just caught his horse that was grazing under the hedge his other companion that i had taken the pistol from had drawn a broad cutting sword and was laying at me i by good fortune had before me a great coat for fear of rain and the ball of his pistol had broke the strap so that i wrapped it round my left arm and received his blow which did me no damage and in the mean time thrust my sword into his side up to the hilt which nevertheless did not kill him but he called to his companion come harry let us make off for by g  d i believe i am killed accordingly they fled as fast as ever they could back again the way we came with my sword in his breast for when he received the wound he turned so short with his horse that wrung the hilt out of my hand mr musgrave was for following them but i found some pain in my shoulder and it began to grow stiff being cold and chose to go on but in our riding and talking of the late accident we lost our road and had taken that which had led to gloucester and riding on we met the third highwayman whose horse had run away with him who was coming back as we supposed to see how things went as soon as ever he saw us he turned his horse and rid away as hard as ever he could and we rid as fast after him it being as we thought our road we followed him through several villages and we called to the people to stop him but to no purpose at last his horse stumbled which gave us time to come pretty near him when he found he could not escape us he turned about and discharged a pistol at us i had one pistol that i had not fired yet which i drew from the housing and let fly at him and wounded him in the neck he fled as fast as he could and our horses beginning to tire he got out of our sight we asked several people we met whether they had seen any such person and they told us he was gone into gloucester town ere then we followed and got into gloucester immediately and were told such a man was seen to ride through the town so we pursued him no farther our horses being very much tired but they sent a hueandcry after him but to no purpose for they returned no wiser than they went out we stayed at gloucester two days to have my wound dressed and then rode to bristol where all our friends waited impatiently for us being we had exceeded our time three days after having settled my money in the hands of people that the captain appointed to improve it for me i resolved to make a trip to ireland to see my sister that was married very well to a merchant there but hearing of the grand fleet making preparation for some expedition put us all agog and my natural genius for travel made me once more resolve to be gadding i opened my mind to captain pultney who advised me to the contrary but i told him i was so much concerned for my fathers death as indeed i was that i should sooner wear it off at sea than on shore being here every object that i saw put me in mind of him he was very well satisfied with my reasons at last but says he i would not have you go in any post but as a voluntier that you may not be confined to stay longer than you should desire i thought this the best way therefore resolved for london with all my companions and get us a ship i had letters of recommendations to secretary burchet and several gentlemen that had the management of the navy we arrived at london february the   th   0  mr musgrave and i entered on board the breda captain fog commander because we were informed admiral benbow would hoist his flag in that ship mr musgrave having formerly had some acquaintance with the admiral waited on him and had a warrant for a quartermaster given him the rest of our companions entered before the mast that is common sailors in the same ship hood was soon made cooks mate and the rest of em got some little office that raised em something above the common sailors though they entered as such and all by the means of mr musgrave who acquainted the admiral with their fortunes when we had sent all our things on board and not knowing when they would sail mr musgrave and i got leave to go to portsmouth by land where we arrived on saturday march the   d and stayed there till the english and dutch fleet arrived a squadron was ordered out to cruise of which our ship was one but an unlucky accident hindered my going with her but mr musgrave was forced to go against his inclinations and leave me behind him which was as follows one evening coming from seeing a play at the bulls head a gentleman coming out with a lady the crowd by chance jostled me against the lady which this gentleman mr martin nephew to johnny gibson governor of the place took as an affront put upon him being he had the care of the lady but i begged her pardon and told her it was an accident i could not help but he being in a strange passion called me several genteel names as rogue rascal and such like and struck me over the head with his cane though i did not much mind his words i did not care to take his blows without a return which i did with interest and we were soon parted but an hour after being at the aforesaid bullhead at supper the drawer came up and told us there was a gentleman below desired to speak one word to mr falconer there was one mr langley lieutenant to the windsor man of war that i had made an acquaintance with at the play that promised to come and sup with us and i took the message to come from him but was surpised to find it the gentleman that i had the bustle with he wanted to drink a glass of wine withme he said and led me into a room when we were there he told me he came for satisfaction of the affront i put upon him about an hour ago therefore draw added he or i will run you through i endeavored to pacify him with good words yet all to no purpose he made so many thrusts at me that i was in danger of my life but at last i disarmed him but not without a little wound in my arm as soon as i gave him his sword again he pushed at me with all the malice imaginable and hearing the people from all parts of the house coming to see what was the matter he clapped his back against the door to keep em out which they on the other side broke open and giving him a push his breast ran against the point of my sword which appeared at his back and he fell down without any sign of life the people coming in i was immediately secured and carried to prison till they knew whether he would live or die i was mightily concerned not from any danger was to be feared but that it would be a hindrance to my voyage the gentleman continued in a violent fever a great while and his life was despaired of but at last after a tedious illness recovered but continued weak one day he came to visit me in a chair where i was confined and told me he was very sorry for what had happened and that to day i should be at liberty and accordingly came an order in the afternoon for my freedom without paying any fees but to my great grief the fleet was sailed and benbows squadron designed for the indies but mr martin begged me to be patient and he would procure me a passage in a storeship that would sail in a week at farthest for jamaica and he was as good as his word for the next day he carried me to captain young commander of the tiger storeship and entered me immediately then my heart began to be at rest and i gave him thanks and for the time we stayed there mr martin and i were very intimate and he expressed himself so genteelly about our former encounter that he gained my esteem  passion indeed is certainly a madness and therefore what is done in that heat ought to be forgot if the person themselves repent of it but how humane it would be if in the midst of that fire of passion which blazes out they could sprinkle the cool water of reason and quench it for nothing more deforms the mind or body than passion and it is then we lose our humane form and are metamorphosd into beasts how many great and good men have done such things in passion that they have repented of all their lives after therefore passion may be well termed a pilfering devil that steals away our senses and prompts us to do actions unbecoming the form we bear  we set sail from spithead may the    th   0  and our captain gave us hopes of overtaking the fleet by reason he said one ship could make better way than a whole fleet being they were obliged to wait for one another we met with nothing extraordinary but a storm that drove us almost upon the island madera which being so nigh our captain resolved to anchor at and accordingly we did in the bay of the city of funzal the capitol of the place captain young and i went on shore to view the town  funzal the capitol of this island is a large handsome city with one cathedral and four other churches all neatly built two cloisters one for the men and the other for the women the city contains   00 houses there is also computed to be upon this island  00000 inhabitants i bought a portugueze book here that gives a better account of the first discovery of this island than any i have seen extant which mr musgrave translated for me in english i have seen it in french since but not truly translated being there was something left out concerning king edward the third that conquered france and as the honor belongs to the english as the first inhabitants i shall here give it you faithfully translated it being but short i hope it will not be found tedious for in all my voyages i avoid prolixity as being offensive to all readers and the places i describe are generally such as are not frequented by the english it being my fortune to be carried there  the history of the discovery of the island of madera written originally in portugueze by don francisco de alcafarado and translated into english by w musgrave native of jamaica when england was settled in a lasting peace after the turmoils and hazard of a dangegerous war king edward the third who conquered france and fixed his royal standard in the city of paris he who had felt the inconveniences of war knew how to encourage the pleasures of peace and london the metropolitan city of the kingdom became the seat of mirth and jollity all thoughts of war were banished the ensigns now were furled and swords were wore for ornament not use among the rest that embellished the court was one lionel machin the youngest brother of a noble family and consequently not overrich yet a gentleman which often happens in younger brothers that was reckoned the only ornament of the root from whence he sprung this gentleman fell desperately in love with a lady beautiful to perfection and the only boast of her time but there was a vast disparity in their fortunes for she was the only daughter to a nobleman whose riches exceeded most of his rank and consequently courted by those that could make her a jointure equal to the fortune her father would give her but nevertheless the force of love is such that it never minds interest nor duty and the young lady whose name was arabella was so much taken with the winning behavior of lionel that she placed her entire affection upon him who was indeed bating his slender means the most deserving of her but the parents of arabella hearing of the amity that was between em complained to king edward and begged that he would interpose his royal authority the king used many persuasions to lionel to withdraw his affections but it was like bidding the sun stand still or the wind or rain to cease for their affections were so strongly united that nothing could ever part em the father having provided a fit match for his daughter entreated the king to secure lionel till the marriage was solemnized who granted his request and clapped lionel in prison under pretense of some treasonable practices when immediately the marriagerites were performed and arabella was constrained to give her hand where it was not in her power to give her heart and parents are to blame to force their children to marry against their inclinations being from thence springs such disorders in families that is not in their power to compose as soon as the ceremony was over the husband carried his lady to a palace seated upon the river severn near bristol when done lionel was released out of prison but with a heavy heart for the loss of his dear arabella but still his love increased from the difficulties he found to obtain his desire and knowing it impossible to live without her thought of a stratagem that gave him hopes of conquering all difficulties he summoned about thirty young gentlemen all resolute bold and fit for any undertaking when he had got em all together he made this short oration to em  most here are my relations or what is a nearer tie my bosomfriends you all know the indignity i have suffered by arabellas forced marriage therefore i require you all to assist me in whatever i shall undertake without tainting your honor to be revenged for the affront put upon me to this request they all agreed to serve him with their lives and fortunes  whereupon it was resolved to part and take several ways to bristol when they all arrived at their place of rendezvous they consulted together and resolved to seize any ship in the river that they found was fit for their turn lionel thought nothing difficult when love was to be the reward but now he wanted some means to let arabella know their design but at last it was agreed that one of their company should enter into the service of the husband which fell out as they could wish and a proper person was hired to be groom where he had the care of a fine spotted horse that used to carry the lady abroad to visit her neighbors the wind proving fair notice was given that the project was to be put in execution the pretended groom to favor the business had omitted giving arabellas horse any water when arabella had notice of the hour she ordered her spotted horse to be sadled under pretense of taking the air attended with her groom and two more of her domestics when they came near the cape of land where lionel and his companions waited for her the horse by beating of the waves against the shore heard and smelt the water and made down to it to drink where lionel immediately laid hold of the lady who seemed to be mightily frightened and put her in their boat and made off now the day that they had seized the lady was also pitched on to seize the ship they had a design upon which was easily done being their crew were most of them a shore they cut her cables and made off to sea withal the sail they could bear and soon got out of sight and directed their course for france but a storm met them and drove them quite contrary lionels friends now began to repent of their undertaking and lionel was mightily concerned for the danger of her he loved more dear than life who though mightily disordered with the sea yet seemed contented in having the object of her desire with her thirty days they were the sport of the waves every day expecting death but one morning they discovered land high craggy and very woody which filled them with joy more especially lionel for now he hoped a resting place for his dear arabella none in the ship could guess what land it could be for they knew it was not inhabited being birds of all sorts were so tame that they would suffer themselves to be taken with the hand the place they chose for their habitations was a fine grove of laureltrees that were very delightful as was also every part of the country they had rambled over finding they were to stay there a great while they got out of their ship several necessaries and lived very pleasant for about    days designing to commit themselves in a day or two to the mercy of the waves for though the island was delightful to live in yet it seemed tiresome to those that wanted many things they enjoyed in their own country  the night before they designed to embark a violent storm rose and drove the ship from the island with about    men that were preparing all things for sailing the next day these were tossed by the winds and sea for many days but at last to their great joy discovered land where they ran their ship on shore being she was so leaky she could hardly swim but their joy for being saved from the watery element soon changed to sorrow when they found themselves taken by the moors they being landed on the coast of africa their new masters after hard usage arrived at the city of morocco with their purchase where they sold them in the market like cows or oxen but all declaring they were men of rank they were imprisoned in hopes of large ransoms  when lionel and arabella and the rest that were left on shore discovered the next morning their fatal disaster grief siezd them with such a force that some of them lost their senses running frantic up and down the woods and raving killed themselves poor arabellas grief sunk inward and preyed upon her life with such violence that death appeared to her rescue she never upbraided linel with her misfortunes but closed her eyes with a true repentance of her failings  lionel was like a distracted man laid himself down at her feet and could not be removed till death gave him his release his companions buried them together in one grave and at the foot erected a cross to show those that were interred there died under the banner of christ upon the bark of the tree they cut in letters the whole story of their misfortunes the rest that remained upon the island proposed to themselves of venturing into their boat which by good fortune was left on shore and steered their course to the nighest main land where they happily arrived without danger but ran the same fate with their other companions that were thrown on the same coast in the ship that they all thought was cast away all the comfort they received in their misfortunes was that they were committed to the same prison that their companions were in they were over joyd to find those alive that were thought dead but mourned to think of meeting in such a melancholy place in the same prison was one juan de morales a noted pilot and an excellent navigator this man was mightily pleased with the tales of these english gentlemen and so often begged them to repeat their adventures that he had every mark of the island exact and perfectly saw it in immagination in the year      don sancho son to ferdinand king of arragon died in castile and left considerable sums of money to redeem spanish prisoners that were captive in barbary among the rest was juan de morales and at the same time the english gentlemen got their ransom and safely arrived in their own country with a pardon for their offense from the king of england and the husband of arabella morales and all his ships crew were taken by the portugals who met with em cruising in those seas but all excepting morales had their liberty given them who was detained for his knowledge in the mathematics and promises were made him of great recompense if he would serve king john of portugal in his discoveries  as soon as they were arrived at lisbon morales was presented to the king by don henry the infant who was a great encourager to new discoveries where he opened the whole story of lionel and arabella which was so generally received that a fleet was ordered immediately for this new voyage and june the   d    0 set out to sea well armed they designed first for porto sancto as being nigh the island as morales conjectured the english abandoned  when they arrived there the inhabitants advised them not to go any farther in their discoveries toward the n e being there was a black cloud which would terminate their navigation because there was not any one that ever attempted it but lost their lives for their presumption and were never heard of more notwithstanding gonsalvo the admiral and morales the pilot were well assured that very cloud was the island they wanted to find they were the more convinced in it by reason the cloud continued of the same color through every change of the moon but the rest of the ships crew were of the contrary opinion and mutinizd against morales telling him that he being a castilian an consequently their enemy did it to disgrace them and that it was a presumptious thing to pretend to search into the secrets of providence  notwithstanding their grumblings they set sail from porto sancto and made forward for their discovery but the nearer they approached this cloud the more frightful it grew which caused a terrible fear in all the sailors entreating gonsales to return and not to be the death of so many innocent people but still they held their course for all their clamours yet gonsales to encourage the sailors assured em it must be firm land and to dissipate their fears made em this following oration  why should i be more hardy than you but that i am confirmed it is as i tell you if there should be any danger have i any means to extricate my self more than your selves is not my life as precious to me as any of yours my companions a foolhardiness does not become us it is true but a firm courage is what all men should be endud with every person here has ventured his life for his king in battle before now without half the recompense or honor that will be gained by this expedition if we succeed as we certainly shall if we arm our selves with resolution to overcome all difficulties banish your fears and call your reason to your aid and let us proceed in the name and for the honor of god and our king  they proceeded cheerfully animated by this oration and in a little time entered the cloud or settled fog but the tide driving the vessel too far north they put out their boats to tow their ship in the midst of the cloud but the farther they rowed the cloud seemed to decrease and presently after they discovered land to their great joy being it was what but few of them expected the first cape they discovered was called by gonsales cape st lawrence which they doubled and saw a fine and fertile country full of fair and lofty trees that made the prospect delightful sailing on they discovered a large bay which morales judged to be the place where the english were thrown but it being late gonsales ordered to let fall the anchors not caring to land till they had the whole day before them the next morning they landed and found it to be the same place where lionel machin and arabella were buried  when they had given account to the admiral of the state of things he landed and took possession of the island for his master john the first king of portugal they erected an altar upon the tomb of the two lovers said mass and returned god thanks for their happy success  gonsales termed the island madera from the quantity of its wood which in the portugueze language signifies woody that was found all over the island but no humane inhabitants  after they had searched well on shore boats were ordered to row round the island being it was dangerous for their ship by reason of many rocks and shallows that lay in the water so steering west they discovered four fine small rivers running into the sea the water being extremely clear gonsales ordered some to be bottled to present to the king of portugal his master at his return  going farther several soldiers were landed in a valley which was watered by a fine river and a noble grove of trees that made a perfect harbor where gonsales erected a large cross  sailing on they came to a point of land that ran a great way into the sea which was inhabited by such a number of great different birds that the men were afraid of being devoured by em this place was named punta des gralhos from the large number of birds  going forward they discovered a valley covered with fine large cedartrees next to that they found another large one where was a great lake or pond from whence they could perceive the bay they set out from with searching the country they discovered a large plain which overlooked the rest of the island free from trees but covered over with a beautiful fennal called by the portugueze funchall upon this plain they built a city and called it funchall from the quantity of fennel that was found there which was formerly a bishops see but is still the chief place for temporal affairs  from this plain runs three rivers into the sea which form an island and landlock the haven secure from storms and tempests  gonsales still sent out more men for discoveries in the island where they found a white rock called by the portugueze praya formosa or the fair rock below which was a fierce torrent of water so clear that obliged em all to observe it two resolute soldiers pulled off their clothes and attempted to swim across the stream but were hurried away with the current in such an impetuous manner that they had perished if they had not been timely succored by their companions by ropes which they threw in and pulled em up against the violence of the stream this torrent they named soccorides  the most remarkable thing they found in their voyage was a great number of seawolves which rushed out of a cave into the water when they approached em gonsales gathered all sorts of plants roots flowers and minerals together with all sorts of birds and a large parcel of the earth and embarked for portugal where he safely arrived august the   d the same year    0 where he was received with all the favor imaginable  in may      gonsales was made governor of the whole island with an additional title of count and in the same month set sail with his wife and two daughters and many more for the inhabiting the same where he happily arrived and laid the foundation for the present capitol of funchal or funzal but to honor lionel machin who was there interred he called the place porto machino and over the grave he erected a noble church some writers relate that gonsales set the woods on fire that continued burning for seven years which made wood scarce in that island but there is such plenty of all sorts that i look upon that story but as a fable the island daily increased in its inhabitants till it came to the now flourishing state it remains in  madera is situated in thirty degrees and thirtyone minutes in circumference and about forty leagues twelve in length about two broad the air so temperate that neither heat nor cold is troublesome and the soil so fertile that it yields more corn for the bigness of the place than any other island as large again the grass shoots up so high that they are obliged to burn it and in the ashes they plant sugarcanes which in six months time produce sugar the inhabitants are more civilized than any of the canaryislands  after we had made an end of our affairs we set sail from thence and directed our course for teneriff one of the canaryislands or the insulae fortunatae of ptolomy where we safely arrived this island lies in twentyseven degrees and thirty minutes about fourteen leagues in length sancta cruze the place where we anchored is the chief harbor it is an island very well inhabited containing three cities or large towns besides a great number of villages but what it is famed most for is the pike or high mountain that rears its head above the clouds and seems to scale even heaven it self i have seen many people that have told me they have been at the top of this mountain but none give so good a description of it and even the whole island as the right reverend dr sprat in his history of the royal society which is as follows  having furnished our selves with a guide servants and horses to carry our wine and provision we set forth from oratava a porttown in the island of teneriff situated on the northside two miles distant from the main sea and traveled from twelve at night till eight in the morning by which time we got to the top of the first mountain toward the pico de terraira there under a very large and conspicuous pine tree we took our breakfast dined and refreshed our selves till two in the afternoon then we passed through many sandy ways over many lofty mountains but naked and bare and not covered with any pinetrees as our first nights passage was this exposed us to excessive heat till we arrived at the foot of the pico where we found many huge stones which seemed to have fallen from some upper part about six in the evening we began to ascend the pico but we were scarce advanced a mile and the way being no more passable for horses we left them with our servants in the ascent of one mile some of our company grew very faint and sick disordered by fluxes vomitings and aguish distempers our horses hairs standing upright like bristles and calling for some of our wine carried on small barrels on a horse we found it so wonderfully cold that we could not drink it till we had made a fire to warm it notwithstanding the air was very calm and moderate but when the sun was set it began to blow with such violence and grew so cold that taking up our lodging amongst the hollow rocks we were necessitated to keep great fires in the mouths of em all night about four in the morning we began to mount again and being come another mile up one of our company failed and was not able to proceed any farther here began the black rocks the rest of us pursued our journey till we came to the sugar loaf where we began to travel again in a white sand being fitted with shoes whose single soles are made a finger broader than the upper leather to encounter this difficult passage having ascended as far as the black rocks which lay all flat like a plain floor we climbed within a mile of the very top of the pico and at last we gained the summit where we found no such smoke as appeared a little below but a continual perspiration of a hot and sulphurous vapor that made our faces extremely sore all this way we found no considerable alteration of the air and very little wind but on the top it was so impetuous that we had much ado to stand against it whilst we drank the kings health and fired each of us a piece here also we took our dinner but found that our strong water had lost their virtue and were almost insipid while our wine was more spirituous and brisk than before the top on which we stood being not above a yard broad is the brink of a pit called the caldera which we judged to be a musket shot over and near fourscore yards deep in form of a cone hollow within like a kettle and covered with small loose stones mixed with sulphur and sand from among which issued diverse spiracles of smoke and heat which being stirred with any thing puffs and makes a noise and so offensive that we were almost suffocated with the sudden emanation of vapors upon the removing one of these stones which were so hot as not easily to be handled we descended not above four or five yards into the caldera because of the slipperiness under foot and the difficulty but some have adventured to the bottom other matters observable we discovered none besides a clear sort of sulphur which lay like salt upon the stones from this renowned pico we could see the grand canaries    leagues distant palma    and gomera   which interval of sea seemed not much wider than the thames about london we discerned also the herro being distant about  0 leagues and so to the utmost limits of the sea much farther as soon as the sun appeared the shadow of the pico seemed to cover not only the whole island and the grand canaries but the sea to the very horizon where the top of the sugar loaf or pico visibly appeared to turn up and cast its shade into the air itself at which we were much surpised but the sun was not far ascended when the clouds began to rise so fast as that they intercepted our prospect both of the sea and the whole island except the tops only of the subjacent mountains which seemed to pierce them through whether these clouds do ever surmount the pico we cannot say but to such as are far below they seem sometimes to hang above it or rather wrap themselves about it as constantly when the west winds blow this they call the cap and is the infallible prognostic of ensuing storms one of our company who made this journey again two years after arriving at the top of the pico before day and creeping under a great stone to shroud himself from the cold air after a little space found himself all wet and perceived it to come from a perpetual trickling of water from the rocks above him many excellent and exuberant springs we found issuing from the tops of most of the other mountains gushing out in great spouts almost as far as the huge pine tree which we mentioned before having stayed a while at the top we all descended the sandy way till we came to the foot of the sugar loaf which being steep even almost to a perpendicular we soon passed and here we met with a cave about  0 yards deep and    broad being in shape like an oven or cupola having a hole at the top near   yards over this we descended by a rope that our servants held fast at the top while with the other end being fastened about our middles we swung our selves till being over a bank of snow we slid down lighting upon it we were forced to swing thus in our descent because in the midst of the bottom of this cave opposite to the overture at the top is a round pit of water like a well the surface whereof is about a yard lower but as wide as the mouth at top and about six fathom deep we supposed this water not a spring but dissolved snow blown in or water trickling through the rocks about the sides of the grot for some height there is ice and icicles hanging down to the snow but being quickly weary of this excessive cold place and drawn up again we continued our descent from the mountains by the same passage we went up the day before and so about five in the evening arrived at orotava from whence we set forth our faces so red and sore that to coll em we were forced to wash and bath them in whites of eggs the whole height of the pico in perpendicular is vulgarly esteemed to be two miles and a half no trees herbs nor shrubs did we find in all the passage but pines and among the whiter sands a kind of broom being a bushy plant and on that side where we lay all night a kind of coalon which had stems eight foot high and the trunk near a foot thick every stem growing in four squares and emerging from the ground like tuffs of rushes upon the edges of these stems grow very small red buttons or berries which being squeezed produce a poisonous milk which falling upon any part of a horse or other beast fetches off all the hair from the skin immediately of the withered sticks of this vegetable we made our fire all night this plant is also universally spread over the island and is perhaps a kind of euphorbium  of the island teneriff it self this account was given by a judicious and ingenious man who lived twenty years in it as a physician and merchant his opinion is that the whole island being a soil mightily impregnated with brimstone did in former times take fire and blow up all or near all at the same time and that many mountains of huge stone calcined and burnt which appears all over this island especially in the southwest part of it were cast up and raised out of the bowels of the earth at the time of that general conflagration and that the greatest quantity of this sulphur lying about the center of the island raised up the pico to that height at which it is now seen and he says that any one upon the place that shall carefully note the situation and manner of those calcined rocks how they lie will easily be of that mind for they lie says he three or four miles almost round the bottom of the pico and in such order one above another almost to the sugar loaf as it is called as if the whole ground swelling and rising up together by the ascension of the brimstone the torrents and rivers of it did with a sudden eruption roll and tumble them down from the rest of the rocks especially as is said before to the southwest for on that side from the very top of the pico almost to the sea coast lie huge heaps of these burnt rocks one under another and there still remain the very tracts of the brimstone rivers as they run over this quarter of the island which has so wasted the ground beyond recovery that nothing can be made to grow there but broom but on the northside of the pico few or none of these stones appeared and hence he concludes that the vulcanio discharged it self chiefly on the southwest side he adds farther that at the same time mines of several mettles were blown up some of those calcined rocks resembling ironoar some silver and others copper particularly on the southwest parts called azuleios being very high mountains where never any englishman but himself that ever he heard of was there are vast quantities of a loose bluish earth mixed with blew stones which have a yellow rust upon em like that of copper or vitriol as also many small springs of vitriol water where he supposes a copper mine and he was told by a bellfounder of oratavia that he got out of two horse loads of this earth as much gold as made two large rings and a portugueze who had been in the west indies told him that his opinion was there were as good mines of gold and silver there as the best in the west indies thereabouts also are nitrous waters and stones covered over with a deep saffroncolourd rust tasting of iron and farther he mentions one of his friends which of two lumps of earth or oar brought from the top of this side of the mountain made two silver spoons all this he confirmed by the last instance of the palmisland    league from the teneriff where about    years since a vulcanio was fixed the violence thereof made an earthquake in this island so great that he and others ran out of their houses fearing they would have fallen upon their heads they heard the noise of the torrent of flaming brimstone like thunder and saw the fires as plain by night for six weeks together as a burning torch and so much sand and ashes brought from thence by the wind and clouds fell upon his hat as would fill the sandbox of his inkhorn  in some places of this island grows a crooked shrub called legnan which they bring for england as a sweet wood there are likewise apricocks peachtrees and others which bear twice a year also pear trees as pregnant almonds with a tender shell palms plantains oranges and lemons especially the paeguadaes which have small ones within them from whence they are so denominated also they have sugarcanes and a little cotton colloquintida etc the roses blow at christmas there are good carnations and very large but no tulips will grow or thrive there samphire clothes the rocks in abundance and a kind of clover the ground another grass grows near the sea which is of a broader leaf so luscious and rank that it will kill a horse that eats of it but no other beast eighty ears of wheat have been found to spring from one root but grows not very high the corn of this is transparent like the purest yellow amber and one bushel has brought forth a hundred in a seasonable year  the canary birds which they bring to us in england bred in the barancos or gills which the water has fretted away in the mountains being places very cold there are also quails partridges larger than ours and exceeding beautiful great wood pigeons turtles at spring crows and sometimes the falcons come flying over from the coast of barbary  bees are carried into the mountains where they prosper exceedingly and there they have wild goats which climb to the very top of the pico sometimes also hogs and multitude of coneys  of fish they have the cherna a very large and excellent fish better tasted than any we have in england the mera dolphins lobsters without great claws mussles periwincles and the clacas which is absolutely the very best shellfish in the world they grow in the rocks five or six under one great shell through the top holes whereof they peep out with their nibs from whence the shells being broken open a little more with a stone the draw them there is also another sort of fish like an eel which has six or seven tails of a span long united to one head and body which is also as short besides there they have turtles and cabridos which are better than our trouts the island is full of springs of fresh water tasting like milk which in lalagima where the water is not so clear and lympid they cleanse by percolating it through a kind of spungy stone cut in form of a basin the vines which afford those excellent wines grow all about the island within a mile of the sea such as are planted farther up are not much esteemed nor will they thrive in any of the other islands concerning the guanchios or ancient inhabitants he gave this full account the   d of september about    years since he took his journey from guimar a town for the most part inhabited by such as derive themselves from the ancient guanchios in the company of some of them to view their caves and the corpse buried in them a favor they seldom or never permit to any having the corpse of their ancestors in great veneration and likewise being extremely against any molestation of the dead but he had done several elemosinary cures among them for they are very poor yet the poorest think themselves too good to marry with the best spaniard which endeared him to them exceedingly otherwise it is death for any stranger to visit these caves and bodies the corpse are sewed up in goats skins with thongs of the same with very great curiosity particularly in the incomparable exactness and evenness of the seams and the skins are made very close and fit to the corpse which are for the most part entire the eyes closed hair on their heads ears nose teeth lips and beard all perfect only discolored and a little shrivled likewise the pudenda of both sexes he saw about three or   hundred in several caves some of them standing others lying upon beds of wood so hardened by an art they had which the spaniards call curay to cure a piece of wood that no iron can pierce or hurt it these bodies are very light as if made of straw and in some broken bodies be observed the nerves and tendons and also the spring of the veins and arteries very distinctly by the relation of the most ancient of this island they had a particular tribe that had this art only among themselves and kept as a thing sacred and not to be communicated to the vulgar these mixed not themselves with the rest of the inhabitants nor married out of their own tribe and were also their priests and ministers of religion but when the spaniards conquered the place most of them were destroyed and the art perished with them only they held some traditions yet of a few ingredients that were used in this business they took butter some say they mixed bearsgrease with it which they kept for that purpose in the skins wherein they boiled certain herbs first a kind of wild lavender which grows there in great quantities upon the rocks secondly an herb called lara of a very gummy and glutinous consistence which now grows there under the tops of the mountains thirdly a kind of cyclamen or sowbread fourthly wild sage which grows plentifully upon this island these with others bruised and boiled up with butter rendered it a perfect balsam this prepared they first unbowel the corpse and in the poorer sort to save charges took out the brains behind after the body was thus ordered they had in readiness a lixivium made of the bark of pinetrees wherewith they washed the body drying it in the sun in summer and in the winter in a stove this repeating very often afterward they began their unction both without and within drying it as before this they continued till the balsam had penetrated into the whole habit and the muscle in all parts appeared through the contracted skin and the body become exceeding light then they sewed them up in goatsskins as was before mentioned the ancients say that they have above twenty caves of their kings and great personages with their whole families yet unknown to any but themselves and which they will never discover lastly he says that bodies are found in the caves of the grand canaries in sacks quite consumed and not as these in teneriff anciently when they had no knowledge of iron they made their lances of wood hardened as before memtiond they have earthen pots so hard that they cannot be broken of these some are found in the caves and old bavances and used by the poorer people that find them to boil meat in their food is barley parched and then ground with little stone mills and mingled with milk and honey which they always carry with them in goatsskins at their backs to this day they drink no wine nor care for flesh they are very ingenious lean tall active and full of courage for they leap from rock to rock from a prodigious height till they come to the bottom sometimes making ten fathoms deep at one leap in this manner first they tertiate their lances which are about the bigness of a half pike and aim with the point at any piece of a rock upon which they intend to light sometimes not half a foot broad in leaping off they clap their feet close to the lance and so carry their bodies in the air the point of their lance comes first to the place which breaks the force of their fall then they slide gently down by the staff and pitch with their feet on the very place they first designed and so from rock to rock till they come to the bottom but their novices sometimes break their necks in the learning he told also and the same was very seriously confirmed by a spaniard and another canary merchant there in the company that they whistle so loud as to be heard five miles off and that to be in the same room with them when they whistle were enough to endanger the breaking the tympanum of the ear and added that he being in company of one that whistled his loudest could not hear perfectly in    days after he affirms also that they throw stones with a force almost as great as that of a bullet and now use stones in all their fights as they did anciently  this account was given to that ingenious and reverend divine dr sprat bishop of rochester by some english merchants who had the curiosity to ascend the pico one of the highest mountains in the world neither could i find him out in any thing but in the height he allows it to be but two miles and a half but all the inhabitants agree to make it a full league high  captain young and i attempted to ascend it but there was such a thick fog that we were persuaded to the contrary we went up about a quarter of a mile but were so wet with the fog that we had not a dry thread about us  when we had satisfied our curiosities as far as we could we set sail from teneriff and made our course for the west indies we met a dutch ship from batavia that was drove by ill weather several degrees out of her due course we spared em what necessaries we could being they were in great want and took our leaves of em the same evening a storm overtook us and drove us out of our course but in the night it turned stark calm the next morning we discovered a galley with turkish colors out rowing up to us with all their strength we were all surpised and amazed and could hardly give credit to our eyes being no one on board us ever heard of a turkish galley so far from their own coast but it seems we were nigher africa than we supposed as it proved afterward our captain told us we had nothing to do but fight it to the last for if we were taken we might be slaves all our lives long i advised our captain to put out our boat and tow our ship from em for says i if a wind does not rise in the mean time that we may escape em yet we shall gain more time to put our selves in readiness to receive em when they come up with us this advice was approved on and the boat was got out immediately with six men to row and i obliged my self to go along with her to steer her right that they might row with all their strength we towed so tightly for an hour that we made pretty good way with our ship but for all our endeavors we found that in about another hour they would get up with us but we designed to row till they were within a quarter of a mile of us and then go into the ship again in the mean time our men on board had prepared every thing and were in good order to receive em we had sixteen guns and forty men and ammunition enough we were preparing to come on board when we found they were almost up with us but our captain advised me not and ordered us to have arms in the boat with some handgranados and as soon as we should see em engaged to go to the contrary side of the enemy and fire upon em and by that means we should amuse em that they would not venture to board us immediately it was agreed and two more men together with our arms were put into us the galley came up with us in an instant and hailed us in english and bid us strike our colors immediately or it should be worse for us but were answered by us with our cannon instead of our voices and we went to it now to obey my orders i loosed my towrope rowed to get on the other side of the galley but was mightily surpised to find their boat out and about the number of twenty turks getting into her our men in the boat advised immediately to return but i told em twas too late for it would be worse for us if we did nay our captain called to us to come on board but i thought they would do us more injury in getting up the ships side than if we stood em boldly which we resolved to do there was nine of us and we had arms enough so before they could fire at us we discharged our muskets at em and laid our selves under the gunnel of our boat to charge again when we were prepared i ordered em not to stir till the turks had fired and as soon as they had done so to set fire to the fuze of their hand grandos and throw em upon em as soon as we heard the turks fire which did us no damage we set fire to our hand granados as agreed upon and threw em in upon em but they suspecting something it seems ordered but half their number to fire at first and the other half fired upon us so unluckily when we rose to discharge our granados that they killed three of my men outright wounded another dangerously and my self in the left arm it is true our granados killed em four and wounded several but still their number doubled ours and now they prepared to board us my four companions and my self fired upon em with our pieces but could not prevent em boarding us yet we clubbd our muskets on both sides and fell to work but a turk coming behind me while i was engaging with another and struck the cock of his pistol into my skull and i dropped down for dead but when i came to my self which was not in several hours as i was told i found my self on board the galley  they had ordered a surgeon to dress my wounds which were three one in my left arm that in my skull and another upon the side of my throat which i did not feel in the receiving i was ordered to be taken particular care of for being i was not in a sailors habit they thought i was something above the rest and therefore hoped to get a considerable sum for my ransom the surgeon that dressed me was an english renegado whose name was matthews the captain was an englishman too born at deptford but the vilest wretch sure that ever breathed there were several other english renegados on board most of em profligate wretches i understood from my surgeon that the two vessels parted after a desparate engagement and the turks had above fifty men killed and wounded three of my companions were prisoners likewise the fourth being killed in the last conflict and the other expired in the boat with his wounds when i began to mend i walked upon deck and looked about me a little the other three being well had renounced their savior jesus christ he who died for their sins and took upon him the state of man that he might redeem us miserable sinners from the curse of the serpent what must be their punishment who for a little ease in this world forego their portion of eternal life if the tortures of hell have their degrees the last and greatest must be their lot the captain of the galley ordered me one day to be brought before him on the deck where he told me if i did not in a twelvemonth procure him to the value of eight hundred pound for my ransom i should be chained to the oar and be a slave all my life it seems one of the three that was taken with me had fold him of my abilities and that i was possessed of a plentiful fortune i answered i would send to england and do my endeavor to get that sum but i told him it was more than i was worth and there was no hopes of so much money for my ransom unless my friends would out of charity contribute toward it i added i believed i could raise a hundred and fifty or two hundred pounds but he stuck to his text and told me he would bate me nothing of that and when the time was expired that he had fixed if the money did not come i should never have my liberty i told him i would do my endeavor to procure it for him when we came into port and had liberty to write to my friends in england  the captain did design to cruize a month longer that he might take some prize to make him amends for his last disappointment he never importuned me to forsake my religion being if i had been as vile as the others he would not have had any hopes of my money to redeem me we coasted off the shore of africa a fortnight or three weeks but met with no prize which enraged the captain very much one day the surgeon dressing the wound in my head slipped into my hand a letter which he bid me read cautiously and give him an answer the next day i had not an opportunity for several hours to read the contents at last i counterfeited a sudden weakness and retired to my cabin which was in the place we call the forecastle when i laid my self down and found no one was near me i opened my letter and read the contents to this effect  we whose names are subscribed to this have resolved upon a stratagem for our liberty there is seven of us english besides your self and the galleyslaves are  0 in number who have notice of the project one of the english that has the keys of the galleyslaves chains is also one of our number our project must be put speedily in execution being they will go into harbor in ten days and then it will be impossible to effect it we will procure arms and give you farther notice of the hour we must not seem to converse together neither must you take it ill if you find we give you ill language now and then it being only to insinuate our selves into the good esteem of the turks when we have redeemed the slaves we shall be twentyeight in number which will be a sufficient strength to cope with the turks they being but fortyone in all we will convey arms into your cabin by the means of mr matthews and we doubt not but we shall effect our liberty under god  signed ralph smallwood george jenkins george kirk william ashton richard sloan edward wilkins anthony matthews    after i had read it i prayed to god to aid us in our design the next day mr matthews came to dress me as before i gave him to understand that i had read and considered the letter and told him my opinion was to execute it as fast as ever we could for fear of any accident that might happen for says i it is not impossible but we may meet with one of their own galleys and then we shall find it to be a fruitless undertaking says he we must wait a convenient time for if we should fail we must expect the worst of torments he went from me upon this being some of the turks came to look upon my wound the captain asked him how my hurts fared ah dam him says he the christian dog will do well enough i warrant him so much the better answered the captain for i am informed he is worth a great deal of money and i shall set his ransom at a higher rate than what i first determined all this discourse i heard being upon deck talking with my three companions that were taken with me who treated me with ill language and called me christian fool that would not turn mohammedan when i might have all the liberty i desired one of them carried the jest so far that he gave me two or three good strokes with his hand but the captain seeing em said to em laughing let the fool alone it is not worth your while to foul your fingers about him i said so much to em concerning mahomet their false prophet that if the turks had understood me i might have run the danger of being murdered but generally the rengados that is those that forsake their christian faith and turn turks have so little of any religion in em that they laugh at those that have any at all at night mr matthews told me in french very low that the next morning early was designed for their enterprise being it was some fast day with them that they usually at four a clock in the morning rise and wash themselves all over and pray to their prophet for some time and this being to be done below they thought then would be the right time accordingly all that night they spent secretly in preparing every thing he that commanded the slaves which was jenkins found fought with em for something and chastised em as usual but took the opportunity to unlock em all and ordered em to lie still as if their chains were fast till they had command to do otherwise every thing succeeded to our wishes for the turks got up to their devotion sooner than we expected even before it was light and hudling down together we clapped down the hatches and secured the best part of em the captain with two englishmen and one frenchman were seized in the cabin and bound hands and feet and this without any noise about eight others that had not got up as early as the rest our galleyslaves seized and before we could prevent em had killed em all and begged they might serve the captain and the whole crew in the same kind  the bustle the slaves made in killing the eight turks roused the others below from their prayers and when they found they were shut down they made a noise and knocking to be let out which we did but first we loaded a great gun with musket shot and turned the muzzle toward the scuttle then as they came up we bound em but being but few english we could not hinder the slaves from killing several of these too at last we bound em all being twentyfive there being killed by the slaves sixteen and afterward by the consent and agreement of all we chained twenty of em to the oar in the room of those we had released but they began to be very stubborn at first but we put the slaves to em and they soon made em work by giving em the same usage as they generally used to receive from em  when we had secured em we returned god thanks for our happy success and then consulted which way we should steer we english agreed to go for england but the slaves we redeemed being mostly spaniards and portugueze were for going to spain in short there was no agreeing for they being the greater number they pretended to have the command over us never considering twas to us they chiefly owed their liberty i must confess i was very much dissatisfied at their ingratitude but could not find any means to help our selves mr matthews spoke to em in spanish and laid before em the benefit it would be for em to go for england but it was like preaching to so many beasts for they regarded him not but resolved to follow their first design of directing their course for spain when we found there was no remedy we desired em to touch at lisbon in portugal and set us ashore there which they consented with much entreaty if we had been of an equal number we would have endeavored to have forced em with us for england that they might have repented their ingratitude  they would not let any of us have the command of the vessel but one velasques a spaniard was chosen captain who immediately turned out mr matthews that we had given the captains cabin to and took possession of it himself this set us all a murmuring and we consulted to contrive some way to be even with em but they were so watchful and always upon their guard that it was to no purpose to plot any thing they used to put sentinels upon us every time we went to rest one night we was awakened out of our sleep by orders from our new captain velasques when we were upon deck he told us there was a ship discovered to the windward of us now my reason of sending for you says the captain is we design to attack her and make prize of her let her be of what nation she will excepting spanish when mr matthews had told us in english what he said my indignation rose that i could hardly forbear rushing upon him and tear his throat out but at last my reason conquered my passion and i became calm i bid mr matthews let him know he could not expect us to fight if they were english our countrymen but he swore we should fight or be killed if they were our own fathers i bid mr matthews tell him as for my own part i would not fight a stroke let it be what nation it would and for his threatening to kill us i did not know but it would be better to die than to sociate with such an ungrateful crew as they were the ship now instead of keeping her course as she did at first made all the sail she could and bore down upon us which they did not mind in our disputing the captain then began to change his tone and thought it the wisest way to steer away before the wind and endeavor to get from em whereupon he crowded away and belabourd the poor turks with his bastinado to row with all their strength that i pitied em looking toward the ship that pursued us we could perceive english colors out which rejoiced us english mightily we now consulted how we should stop the galley for with sailing and rowing we went faster than they at last i resolved to take a pistol and shoot him through the head let the consequence be what it would so i laid hold of one of the pistols unperceived they having prepared their arms for their engagement goes up to velasques and took him by the throat with my left hand and holding the pistol to his breast with my right i threatened to shoot him dead if he or his men offered to stir several of his companions were running to his assistance but were stopped by mr matthews telling em if they offered to stir their captain was a dead man this bustle caused the turks to lie upon their oars and in the mean tims mr sloan brought the gally to the wind and laid by and the ship got up with us in an instant and without hailing us poured in a broadside upon us which killed us two of the turks and five of our spaniards among which was that ungrateful monster valasques and the wind of one of the shot threw me down upon deck without any farther hurt we had no colors up at all but the vane upon the topmast head which showed us to be a turkish vessel i sent up george kirk to take down that which prevented their firing again upon this they haled us but after we told em we were english they sent immediately two boats well armed on board us and when we had satisfied em how it was with us we seized upon our vile spaniards and portuguese and bound em we saw it was an english man of war and upon enquiry found it was the ruby captain walton commander bound after the fleet for the west indies they had met with capt young and his crew steering their course for england being they were so disabled with the engagement they had with the gally of the turks that we were in they durst not hold on their way for the west indies so the stores were most of em put on board the ruby and the rest were to follow as soon as they could ship em in another vessel now there were two men that were passengers in captain youngs ship put on board the ruby to pursue their voyage and they seeing the galley knew her to be the same that engaged with captain young in the tiger and that was the reason they fired upon us without hailing as is usual in those cases  i was very glad of an opportunity to pursue my voyage i made my address to captain walton who very friendly received me while we were consulting what we should do about our prisoners the galley seemed to lie deeper in the water and going to examine her found a shot had pierced her between wind and water but it was impossible to come to it to stop it so we took what we could out of her and going to unlock the galleyslaves chains the key was not to be found and the galley was sinking every minute and before we could break the chains she sunk down right with the whole  0 poor unfortunate turks and all the spaniards who being tied could not help themselves neither had we time to give em any assistance i must confess i was very much concerned to see so many poor unfortunate creatures meet with death when it was in our power ten minutes before to have saved em captain walton was realy grieved at it and showed a temper full of humanity we had just brought on board the captain and two more englishmen with the frenchman renegados the captain was so sullen that he would not eat or drink but intended as we supposed to starve himself to death captain walton used all gentle means possible to bring him into temper but to no purpose for he would not so much as give any answer to what he asked him and in about a week or eight days after we took him on board he was found dead in his hammock one of the englishmen told us he had poisoned himself for he always said if he was ever taken by the english he would make away with himself to prevent the punishment he should undergo the other four englishmen that were instrumental in our deliverance were all mahometans in appearance as i said before that is they forsook their christianity in outward show but were realy christians in their hearts as was likewise my three companions that were taken in the boat with me but as they told me they only did it to have some opportunity of getting their liberty and the words that were used though it was in a speech they did not understand perfectly shocked em in their utterance and they all hoped their peace was made with god for their crimes with a sincere penitence from the moment they had committed it  mr matthews the surgeon george jenkins william ashton and ralph smallwood were taken in a ship called the two brothers of bristol bound for scanderoon after an obstinate fight where all were killed excepting the abovementioned four who were taken and sold for slaves and continued so for some years but seizing on a boat with the four frenchmen that did design to venture for their liberty with em they put to sea and rather chose to trust in the waves and an open boat than stay there to be slaves for ever but hamet the renegado whose christian name was lewis gordon having notice of their flight followed em with a swift galley and got sight of em mr matthews who relates the story in this manner and his companions seeing it impossible to make their escape thought of a stratagem for four of em to get the good will of the renegado hamet which was this seeing no likelihood of getting clear off the four english proposed to the french to cast lots and that should decide which four should be bound and the other four should immediately row back as if they had no design of running away and make out their story as well as they could accordingly we drew and the lots fell upon the four frenchmen immediately we bound em and rowed back and were soon met by the galley where we made our tale good by telling the turks that going a fishing with the four frenchmen they would have compelled us by force to have rowed with em in their boat for spain but we being not willing fell to grappling with em and overcame em by main force tied em and were bringing em back the frenchmen kept true to their promise and never contradicted us in our story hamet upon this became very civil to us and put us in trust he made me immediately surgeon to the galley mr jenkins master of the slaves and our two other companions had some little office that pleased em we went several voyages with him and took many vessels but never met with any english ship before the tiger that we had the desperate engagement with the four frenchmen were made slaves to row in another galley which was taken about two months ago by a spanish man of war and by that means got their liberty  the other two englishmen and frenchman that were taken in the cabin confessed that they had been guilty of many crimes but more especially in denying their savior but they now felt in their hearts and minds and earning to repentance and begged that captain walton would forgive em and not take their recantation for a falsehood being they were in some danger but a true light of the divine brightness captain walton freely forgave em and having a chaplain in the ship we rechristend em and the fellows seemed ever afterward to have a true sense of their happy condition captain walton and my self were godfathers for em all therefore it behooved us to see that they were now instructed in their faith though these were of sufficient years to know their duty without sureties for em we have many people that undergo that office but never consider what their duty is and in short make it nothing but an outward ceremony when if they thought of it as they ought to do they would find it of the utmost concern for the true office of sureties or godfathers etc are to train up the young plant till it is capable of bearing fruit it self of good works but many nowadays do as the turtles do by their eggs lay em cover em with sand and never more regard em  we came into our old course again and pursued it with success when we were got into the latitude of the tropic we duckd our men as before but there was a great mutiny of the sailors the captain had three dogs on board and they would have em duckd as well as themselves unless he would pay the usual rate which being promised em they were composed again and the sailors and dogs were reconciled without going together by the ears  we overtook an english vessel that had suffered much by an engagement with a spanish pyrate she had lost all her masts but had raised a jury mainmast yet could make but little way by reason of her leaks our captain sent a boat on board and gave em all the assistance he could but finding it was but two days since the engagement we had some hopes of coming up with her being we learnt from the other ship she was mightily disabled as well as themselves so we crowded all the sails we could and though it was in the night we made the best of our way the vessel we left saluted us with five guns to take their leave which we answered with three and in a quarter of an hour afterward heard several guns fired now and then as if some vessel was in distress and in an hour more discovered a light which we made directly toward and coming up with it found it to be the spanish vessel that had engaged with the other english ship two days before the light that they made was only a large lanthorn fixed on their main topmast head that we might the sooner perceive em we immediately hailed em and commanded em to surrender they readily obeyed and begged our assistance which they had great need of for the water gaining upon em every moment in an hours time the ship sunk but we had preserved all the men being in number    having lost in the engagement with the english ship    and received several shot between wind and water which they did not perceive till they discovered two foot water in the hold and found no hopes of being saved from the merciless enemy the sea if we had not fortunately for them came timely to their assistance but to allay their joy for their deliverance from death they were made prisoners and being pirates as we supposed for there was no war declared between the two nations therefore they might very probably think they were to be punished with death when they came on shore  the ship sunk so fast that we could save nothing but the men which took us up about four hours and then we pursued our course and about four in the evening made the island barbados where we set our spanish prisoners on shore captain walton gave the governor an account of what had happened and left it to his discretion to do with em as he thought fit  on june the twentythird we set sail for dominio where we arrived without any accident here i went on shore along with several of our men to get wood and water for our ship the natives seemed very civil and came on board us in their canoes  these indians are most of em tall lusty men well featured and well limbed but poor brains for an ordinary glass of rum will make em drunk they mightily like this liquor and will call for it as soon as ever they come on board you they wear no clothes but a little skirt about their waste but most of em have pieces of brass in the form of a threequarter moon in their nose and ears i gave one of these indians a pair of breeches and he made an essay to put em on in this manner he first put his two arms into the thighs of the breeches and desired one of his companions to button the wasteband about his neck but when we showed him the right way and he had put em on he walked as if he had formerly worn irons and was so uneasy with em that he pulled em off and made signs to have some linen in exchange in return i gave him a long cravat and tied it properly about his neck but to see how the fellow strutted one would have taken him for one of the captains of the traindbands ready to march  i rambled with these indians several miles up in the country and saw their hutts that were digd about three foot deep in the earth and then raised about six foot high above the surface and covered with barks of trees and sometimes divided into apartments by a couple of long poles and fathers sons and daughters lie promiscuously together  the day before we sailed after we had provided our selves with wood and water i went up to the indian hutts to exchange a trifle or two for one of their bows and arrows and returning toward the ship by my self lost my way and though i directed my course as i thought right i came to that part of the shore where was no ship to be found but endeavoring to go more west along the strand my way was intercepted by several high pointed rocks which i made several fruitless essays to pass i then endeavored to make a compass within land to get by the rocks which i did but could not find the bay where the ship rod i was now in a deep perplexity and though very much tired yet resolved to look for the track that would carry me back to some of the huts where i might get an indian to direct me but there were so many various ones that i knew not which to choose at last i pitched upon one that brought me to several of em but not those from whence i came i searched em but could find no indians in em i from thence walked a little farther but was surpised with a sight that shocked me with horror near the skirt of a thick wood i found one of our men killed with an arrow in his throat and by the posture he lay in i found it was done when he was easing nature the object so overcame me that i thought not my own unhappy condition till i was awaked from my stupidity by a noise and gabbling i heard in the wood on my right this put me into a terrible fright which made me run as far from the noise as i could for i made no doubt that if they caught me i should run the same fate with the poor unfortunate fellow who perhaps might lose his life by his seeking me when i had got a considerable distance i entered the wood and ventured to look out where i could perceive though it was almost dark what they were doing  they cut off the poor fellows head and tore out his bowels in a most inhumane manner let any one judge what my condition must be i am sure my thoughts were so confused that i might justly say i never thought at all i observed when they had done they carried him between eight of em upon four staves and went toward their tents when they were gone and i had leisure for reflection every thought was a dagger to me but yet when my senses were composed i put my trust in god that he would deliver me from this danger as well as several other imminent ones which through his mercy i had overcome  i crept farther into the wood to rest my limbs but my thoughts kept me waking all night when day approached i went still farther into the wood not only to avoid those barbarous indians but to see if when on the other side i could find some path that would lead me to the bay where our ship rode but before i could get out of it i heard a cannon discharged that both rejoiced and grieved me it joyd me to know that the ship could not be far off and grieved me to think that it was certainly the signal for the boat to come on board and perhaps they might be that moment under sail i ran with all the haste i could but with a mind mixed with hope and fear i got out of the wood at last and directed my course to that part as i thought the noise of the gun came from but could find no path yet at last i got to the top of a rock from whence i could behold the sea and the great grief to see our ship under sail not half a league from the shore i immediately pulled off my shirt and hung it to a stick i had broke to support me in my walking but my signal did not do me any good for they saw nothing of it my despair began to be predominant over my reason and i had often resolved to throw my self down from the rock to end my misery but still my conscience would give me a secret check and at last i resolved with my self to submit to whatever should befall me with a thorough resignation to the will of heaven as soon as the ship was out of sight i went down from the rock not having power to stir before and endeavored to find some food but was prevented by a hideous noise i heard which drove me to shelter in the wood again but the farther i went the plainer i heard the noise so that i knew not what to do for at last it increased on every side so that coming to a thick parcel of shrubs i laid my self down and couched so close that it was impossible for em to see me unless they came into the very middle of it i had thrown my bow and arrows away as being of no use to me but i had my sword which however i did not design to use the noise came so nigh me that i could hear the tread of their feet and the boughs rustle about me but at last they went insensibly away so that i heard no more of em for some time  when i found all was still i began to get up and look about me where i saw em in the plain engaged with several other indians whom i thought i knew though at a good distance i saw several of em fall upon the ground at last those indians that went hollowing through the wood seemed to me to have the worst of it and were drove by the other party quite back again but did not pursue em any farther only let fly their arrows at em and one of em came among the shrubs where i lay which startled me for i was afraid they would come to look for their arrows and so find me after the hurlyburly was over i resolved to go out of the wood and follow those indians that were vanquishers with this hope that they might be of a milder nature and not so barbarous as the others who run through the wood who to my thinking had more stern looks than those indians i had seen upon that part of the island where we used to land to get wood and water so as i said i got up and directed my course out of the wood after the indians but soon discovered two indian men and four women coming toward me which i suppose had hid themselves during the late conflict it was to no purpose for me to fly for they had got sight of me or if i had they would have soon sent one of their winged messengers after me so i chose boldly to meet em when we were come within forty paces one of another one of the indians was going to shoot at me but was withheld by one of the women as soon as ever i came close to em they looked upon me with strange gestures and distorted countenances i put my hand to my head and breast which is the token of submission with the indians and they let me know by signs that i must go with them which i did not deny for if i had i knew i should be forced so i went willingly enough when we had got through the wood one of the indian men would have my coat and wastecoat of which i durst not refuse the coat he put upon his companion and the wastecoat on himself and strutted strangely i gave my handkerchief and neckcloth to the woman that hindered the indian from shooting at me who received it with a great deal of joy and seemed mightily pleased with me when we arrived at their hutts there came out at least a hundred frightfullooking indians who came about me and had a great deal of talk with those that brought me with em but the two indians were forced to part with their clothes they had taken from me to two of the oldest indians who immediately put em on and seemed mighty proud of themselves they gave me some rice and another sort of victuals boiled but what it was composed of i could never learn neither did i eat any of the same all the while i was among em when night came i was sent into a hutt by my self and the door shut upon me i had a piece of mat to lie on but nothing to cover me now i had leisure to reflect upon my misfortunes which i could not do before by reason of the fears i was in i thought my condition was now worse than ever it was for i really believed they designed to make a sacrifice of me for i thought to my self they were cannibals or meneaters i passed the night with a thousand anxieties and inquietudes but nevertheless my senses were so tired that i slept whether i would or no and in the morning was awaked by four of the eldest indians that came to visit me who made signs to me to follow em which i did without any hesitation when i was out in the midst of the plain place before the doors of their hutts they brought before me several of their women and gave me to know by signs that i should take her to be my mate or bedfellow or suffer death i must confess i was mightily shocked but not giving my self much time to weigh or think of the matter i pitched upon her that i had given my neckcloth and handkerchief too and immediately all the rest were dismissed and my bride and i for it was even so were conducted to a hutt where there was several old indians waiting for me to complete the ceremony when my bride and i came before em we were ordered to sit down then both our feet were washed with water after that they brought us a piece of their indian cake or bread on which i was ordered to break off a piece and give to my bride she then came and laid her head on my breast and then kneeling put my right foot upon her neck when that was done she rose and went out but immediately returned and brought me some flesh broiled on the coals with which she tore into morsels and put in my mouth and stood before me all the while i eat i must confess i was so hungry that i had a very good appetite to my victuals being i had not eat any flesh for four days but i had no great stomach to my bride although a young wellfeaturd woman yet her complexion did not like me when i had done eating my bride and i were put into a hutt and shut close without any light but the old proverb joans as good as my lady in the dark had like to have proved no proverb to me in the morning we were waked with a rude noise round our tent which startled me at first but i found afterward it was a sort of an epithalamium when they had made their frightful noise for sometime they entered promiscuously men and women the men came and took hold of me and the women of my new spouse led us out with shouts unpleasing noises and antic gestures they continued it till we came to a river and then we parted the men with me and the women with my wife they put me into the river and washed me all over and i suppose the women did as much by my tawny rib after they had given notice by their shouts that they had made an end of scowring me they put on my shirt and drawers again and led me to the bank where my spouse waited for me with her sheattendance and we returned with the same noise as we came out when we came to the hutts the old indians met us the old men took me and the old women my wife and gave us an entertainment seperably which lasted two hours according to my computation when they had made an end they fetched us out of our different tents and seated us on a bank and then danced and played such mad rude monkey gambols that put me in mind of the mad feasts of the bachii in virgil for they would tear their faces with their nails and scratch one another so violently that one would have thought they had been so many bethlemites and yet all in mirth for they would laugh such horselaughs when ever any one of em was hurt that quite stunned me when this sport was over the young indians of both sexes took my bride and i into one of their hutts and gave us an entertainment of fish broiled upon the coals and a pleasant liquor in a calabash that was exceeding strong which soon got into most of their noddles and as fast as they grew a little tipsie they reeled out one by one and laid themselves before the door of the hutt and went to sleep my good wife among the rest got her dose too but was so monstrously loving withal that i could not tell well what to do with her when night came we retired to our rest as before and were waked next morning by another kind of noise that was made with rude knocking at our door or rather basket for it was nothing else and five or six of the old indians came in with hatchets and other instruments to enable us to get food for our selves as i understood my wife took me out by the arm and carried me into the wood with our bows and arrows and by her signs gave me to understand that she would bring me where i should kill some creature at last we came to the foot of a hill where we ascended with some difficulty but when we had gained the summit we discovered vast numbers or herds of goats my spouse shot and killed one the first time but i was such a bungler at it that i could never do any execution but my spouse was very dexterous as all the indians are in the island of dominico my wife seemed to have a great love for me and would always make much of me her way when we had skinned our goat we took out our implements and made a fire to broil some of it when it was ready i gave my creator thanks for providing for us poor insignificant mortals and looking toward heaven the residence of him that formed us all my wife fixed her eyes upon me and then looked upwards too with a kind of concern after we had done i returned thanks again in the same manner as before and my wife did the same that is she stard upwards again as if she had a mind to see something as she thought i looked at and when she found she could not see any thing she came to me and put her arm tenderly about my neck and with a sort of a begging tone seemed to ask me by signs and words which i could not understand what i meant by looking upwards i really grieved to know that i could not make her understand for i could not learn any of their speech but here and there a common word neither did i ever perceive they had any manner of worship to any thing otherwise if i would have made her comprehend what i meant i might have found it no hard matter to have converted her from their abominable heathenism for she was of a mighty mild nature very loving and courteous and nothing like the rest of the savage crew who were prone to all manner of wickedness her voice too differed from theirs for most of the indians pronounced their words in their throat as indeed you could not well speak em without a gutteral sound yet she whatever was the meaning on it spoke her words a different way from the rest and had a pleasing manner i really began to love her and only wished she had been my wife in the usual forms she could pronounce any word in english that i would say to her but i could never get her to repeat whole sentences and all she did was like a parrot after we had done our huntingwork i was for going over the hill to view the country and walked up and down a good way but i observed my wife was very uneasy but especially when i got to the brow of the hill on the other side which was about half a league over i made an essay to go down she laid hold of my arms and pulled me back with all her force and with many supplicating actions seemed to beg of me not to go and when she found i was offering at it again she screemd out so dismally that it frighted me from making any more attempts i endeavored to know what she meant but could gather nothing from her words and actions that could let me into any thing but she would often handle her bow and arrows and with menacing actions let me know there was some danger as we went homeward this odd accident ran very much in my head and i was mighty desirous to find out the meaning of it and every time i went to hunt there with my wife i wanted sadly to get down the hill on the other side this hill was of a vast length and extended from east to southwest almost across the island i did not know how to contrive it but after hunting i made believe i was very much tired and laid my self down in order to sleep and my wife with her usual good humor accompanied me and in a very little time i found she was in a sound sleep i immediately rose and stole away softly upon my intended journey i got away from my wife without her awaking and came to the brow of the hill which i surveyed and found no difficulty in the descending when i had got to the pottom of the hill i was mightily pleased with the evenness of the ground and the prospect round me which i could compare to nothing but the vale of esham in england bating the houses and towns in it i had walked up and down the vale for near an hour and was preparing to go back the same way i came when looking back to take my last survey i saw a smoke at a distance and it ran in my mind it was the very place that our men used to go to from on board to truck with the inhabitants the thought took up some of my time and i believe if it had not been for a tender regard for my wife i had certainly directed my course for that smoke i saw there but i must confess i could not think of leaving her behind me but curiosity put it into my head to go a little nearer that smoke i had discovered but just as i was moving that way i heard a dreadful screaming behind me and turning about i saw my wife upon the brow of the hill making the most pitiful lamentation imaginable the tender regard i now began to have for my wife made me make all the haste i could to her relief as thinking some mischance might have befell her when i came to the bottom of the hill i saw several of the indians of our neighborhood waiting for me above and some were coming down as soon as i had got to the top of the hill i was immediately seized by the indians above and dragged along as if i had been the greatest criminal imaginable and my poor wife hanging upon my arm all drowned in tears i could not imagine what was the matter and what could be the reason of their using me in that manner i found it must be something extraordinary by the grief of my wife whose sorrow increased the farther i went toward our hutts but ere we could get there it rained and thundered so violently that we were well washed before we came to our journeys end when we were within ken of our hutts the whole tribe came near us some skipping and dancing as mightily rejoiced others with the face of concern and hanging their heads in sign of sorrow and mightily lamented over my wife after the old indians had consulted some time they tied me to a withered tree that stood at the mouth of the hutts then i began to understand what they meant for i could perceive they were bringing boughs of green wood in order to burn me this sight made my courage fail me and it was impossible to express my despair and horror i found now that the last day of my life was come for it was impossible to foresee any thing to the contrary my last recourse was to the maker and giver of all good things for i had tried all other means in vain as also had my poor wife whose rage and despair overcame her and she was carried away by the women in the utmost agony after my wife was gone they set fire to the wood which enclosed me which being green and wet with the late rain was a great while in burning all the while it was kindling some of the indians jumped round me and danced after their barbarous manner while others stood ready with their bows and arrows to shoot at me as i supposed if the fire should burn the bands that tied me and i should offer to run away the wood being green as i said before was very stubborn in kindling which made the apprehension more dreadful i made several essays to break the bands that held me but all my efforts were but in vain and i observed every time i made my fruitless endeavors the barbarous crew shouted and laughed for joy the fire increasing i prayed to almighty god to give me strength to bear the horrid pain i was going to suffer and if it was possible to go out of the world with the patience and fortitude of a good christian who was only going to change this troublesome life for a better i compared my self to a wounded person that must bear probing of his hurts in order to cure em i now had given my self up entirely to my thoughts of the other world and this seemed to me like abandoning a barren island in order to go to one where was plenty of every thing but before the fire reached me there fell such a prodigious shower of rain mixed with thunder and lightning that extinguished the fire the storm lasted for several hours with the utmost violence and i remained still tied to the tree when the storm was over they began to renew their fire and brought the wood nearer than before it being at first half a yard from my body all round but now they pild it close to me that the fire might the sooner be my executioner which i wished for as knowing it would put me to a speedier death but before they had well placed the wood they heard shouts and noises in the adjacent woods upon which the indians immediately ran away from me and took to their arms in an instant old and young the noise came nearer and nearer still till at last i could perceive several indians bolt out of the wood who were met by our indians and a bloody fight ensued the enemy indians seemed to have the best on it by reason of some firearms that they had with which they made strange havoc with our indians the battle continued for some hours with a great deal of heat and many of our indians fell at last the enemy indians drove ours even beyond the hutts and i could only hear the noise they made being i was still fastened to the tree the fight continued out of sight about half an hour when my wife came running with all the transports of joy imaginable and after having put her head under my feet she untied me and fell upon me with all the signs of a sincere love i must confess i was mightily rejoiced to see my self at liberty and let what would happen my condition could not be worse than it was some hours ago i could not forbear expressing my love to my wife by kisses and embraces we went to our hutt and i took my sword that had been laid up from my first being amongst em i was going out of my tent in order to go with my wife to some other part of the island that was not known to these indians but just as we came among the tents three indians met us that had run way from the fight as i conjectured as soon as they saw me and my wife they came up with a great deal of ill nature in their countenances and after some talk with my wife one of em with his wooden sword went to make a blow at me but my wife interposing received the blow upon her head which struck her to the ground bloody and senseless my rage rose so high upon this that i could not contain my self but i drew my sword and thrust it up to the hilt in the wretches body the other two seeing their companions death ran upon me with the rage of lions but i slipping on one side avoided the strokes intended me they turned immediately upon me and let drive at me several blows which had the good fortune not to hit me but i run one of em into the throat with my sword upon which he set up such a cry that frightened me and ran away and was immediately followed by the other i then ran to the assistance of my wife who lay almost strangled in her own blood i raised her from the earth and seated her under the tree where i was tied and brought her to her self a little but i found her skull was cracked with the blow the indian gave her and to my great grief perceived she was just expiring but the sorrow and tenderness to part with me as i judged by her actions struck me to the soul she laid one arm about my waste and her head in my lap but with such piteous looks with her eyes that almost distracted me she made signs to me to look upward as i fancied to pray for her though i could not tell for certain what she meant but she pronounced several words with earnestness and passion and i really fancied if we ud have understood one another i should have found she would have had some notions of a supreme being before she expired the enemy indians returned with all of our indian prisoners i mean all that they had not killed for out of two hundred indians of our party there was not above twentytwo left they were mightily surpised to find me for many of the enemy indians knew me and when i came to examine their faces i remembered they were the indians that inhabited about the bay where our ship lay one or two of em could speak a little english that they learned by conversing with the english that usually anchored in the bay one of em knew my name that he had gathered from our sailors enquiring for me when sent by the captain before the ship sailed master falconer says he me glad to see you white men belong to great ships come look for you very great and not look you here go away much sorry my wife took up all my thoughts who was just dying and though her strength and speech failed her yet she endeavored to pull down my face to hers which she kissed thn sunk her head into my bosom and expired i was really as much concerned as if i had married one of my own complexion and country for i had great hopes if ever i could have made my escape with her and could but have taught her english to have made her a good christian with the assistance of my now friendly indians i laid her in the earth they told me she was daughter to one of the chief of their enemytribe from these indians i learned that those i had fell amongst were a tribe of indians that had lived on this side the ridge of mountains for many years and declared open war with those of the other side for holding correspondence with whites and were so strict that they put all indians to death that ever attempted singly to go over the mountains which was the reason of my danger of burning the women that they took all that were with child were shot to death and the men in general ran the same fate for they were resolved not to have any one of the breed alive when they had plundered the hutts they went through the woods and over the mountain again and so to their own hutts which i knew the old men and women met em skipping and danceing for joy of their success and some mourning for the loss of a husband brother or father that was slain in battle these friendly indians were often plagued with their sudden rushing upon them and destroying many of them till at last they took up a resolution to assault them and if possible to extirpate the whole race and they had often made inroads upon em which lessened their number till this last ended em as i said before the women and female children dwelt contentedly among em being they had no where to go i began to live comfortably among these indians and used to partake of their diversion and labor as hunting and fishing etc these indians were so expert in shooting with their bows and arrows that i have seen em hit the mark three hundred yards within the compass of a half crown  this island of dominico took its name from its being discovered on a sunday it is computed to be in length about thirty leagues and about twentyeight in breadth it is very mountainous especially to the northeast i have heard there are some french settlements upon the island but i inquired of the abovementioned indian who assured me there was not any inhabitants but natives and of those not above a hundred families who were mostly seated near that part that composed the harbor says the indian that i used to talk with there be some indeed a great way off in de island dat are our fathers and mothers and some of our wives dat when de die we throw into de sea and de swim to dat place and when we die we swim dear too by this we might perceive they had some notion of the immortality of the soul i did my endeavor to make him sensible of the joys of heaven and pains of hell but to no purpose i told him of a superior being that commanded all things below and that righteous people dwelt with him after this life he asked where my god live his throne is in heaven answered i pointing upward where he sits to judge the quick and dead he live up dare high how you get up high no steps reach dare it is our immortal part added i that ascends our soul which is clothed with the grace of our divine creator and enjoys an eternity of blessings you be de white man you have soul we be no white we have no soul when we die we fling in water big fish come carry us to an oder place den we live dare and die again and fish bring us upon back to an oder place how are you assured of this says i have you ever seen any that have been transported in the manner you tell me of no answered he but me sure it be so but when we were carried by fish to dat oder place we eat de leaf of tree dat we can no remember what we do in toter place dat we be bring from all the arguments i could use was of no effect for heathenism was so rooted in him and all the other indians that it will be the greatest difficulty imaginable to bring em to embrace christianity their understandings are so infirm that without a miracle there will be no curing em the indians would have had me married into one of their tribe and i fearful to deny em brought my self off by telling no white could marry under twelve moons after their wives death with which they seemed satisfied but made me promise when that time was expired to change my condition of widower to that of married man i might have been accommodated with a shecompanion if i had found any inclination but i evaded it as well as i could  the soil of the island is very fruitful and there is plenty of every thing  i could not perceive that these indians worshipped any thing except the moon which when at full they would all gather together and looking upward stand gazing a considerable time and then with one consent pronounce a word which sounded like hiu this word they generally repeated three times when they had done stargazing they would fall to jumping and capering like so many mad things when that was over they would retire to their several hutts and not stir out till morning upon any account  i asked will for that was the name of him that could speak english who was mighty proud to be called so what ceremony was it they performed after they were retired into their hutts but he answered me no tell dat wife make much noise she no care for dat when you have new wife you know what we do but me no tell till den what gave me a curiosity to know was that will told me that after the ceremony was over i must not offer to come out of my hutt nor come a nigh any of theirs for if i did they would kill me the hutt that was built for me was ordered in another manner than their own with a high door made of wicket there is being so low that an ordinary sized man must have stooped to go in or out  i used to go fish in their canoes with em where they would catch good store and let it be what it would the cargo was divided among the whole tribe only he that caught em chose first  i told will that as soon as ever a ship arrived there i did design to imbark in her in order to pursue my voyage but he told me i must take care not to let any other of the indians know it for they would never suffer any one to go from em after they had been once settled among em how do you know that says i have you had any talk with em concerning me he told me he had not but it was their way for he gave me to understand that about six years ago there was four men left on shore upon their island by reason of their vessel driving out to sea by a hurricano and these four men settled among em and married indian wives and had children by em but at any time when a ship came into the bay they were hurried a great way up in the country and detained there till the ships were gone and then lived with em as before but a small vessel putting in there by night the englishmen spied it before any of the indians and were got to the shore side conversing with the crew of the vessel before the indians found em out but when they saw em talking together they were mightily enraged the four men went on board the vessel to make merry with their countrymen and afterward came on shore again and made it no secret that they designed to go on board that vessel in order to go to their own country the indians took no notice for the present but the day they designed to imbark they set upon the vessel with their canoes and killed every person on board it when they had done that they took as many things out of her as they had occasion for and set her adrift he told me that the four englishmen were the first that taught em to use firearms and in the ship they took they had several muskets and quantities of powder and shot but carrying the powder to their hutts a boy met em smoking in a cane they call a smoking cane and by some accident the fire caught hold of the powder and blew it up with the death of eight indians and wounding several others after they had brought every thing up to their hutts they took the wives of the four sailors the indians with their children and shot em to death with arrows this is the sense of the story indian will told me which was pretty hard to pick out too considering his manner of telling it the relation made me very uneasy yet put me upon thinking to make my escape the first opportunity i waited a full month before i could see any vessel but at last one came into the harbor i perceived they came in order to get wood by hoisting out their long boat but as i was observing em i was seized by several indians and carried at least six miles up in the country in order to be secured till the ship should be gone i began to despair now of ever getting away being it was natural to suppose that they would be more watchful over me for the future besides i did not know but they would use me after another manner and not let me have so much liberty as i had before i wanted for nothing in my confinement and was only guarded by four indians that went to sleep when i did i once thought i might make my escape whilst they slept but afterward repented that thought in knowing if they should chance to wake i was certainly a dead man for indian will told me as i was carrying away that the indians had orders to shoot me if i offered to make my escape besides i should have found it difficult enough to have known my way especially in the dark for they carried me to a place that i had never been at before i had been here four days and had given over all hopes of my liberty and began to call together my scattered thoughts that were flusterd upon that occasion when on the fourth day about noon i was agreeably surpised with english voices i began to prick up my ears and wished they might come to the place where i was i was not long in expecting of em for one of em spying the hutt where i was called out to the others to come along for here is an indians hutt says he well go in it and see what they will give us with that they immediately came in before two of my indians could hide me the other two being gone in the morning to the village as soon as ever i saw em though strangers i could not forbear showing my transports at the sight of my countrymen they were mightily surpised to see me and when i told em my condition they said they would have me along with em in spite of their teeth but i told em that was very dangerous for if these indians should raise the village that lay within a mile of the shore we should all lose our lives some advised to knock em on the head but i could not agree to that for these were indians that never injured me two of my countrymen had got a couple of spawwater flasks filled with rum upon the sight of which a thought came into my head that seemed the most likely to compass my design i told my countrymen if we could make the indians drunk there might be some hopes of getting off without either hurting them or endangering our selves we drank to one another and the indians did us reason in pledging us for i believe out of the two flasks they drank one and three quarters it soon began to work with them and they got up and fell a dancing most madly and a while after dropped down dead drunk we resolved to tie em hands and feet that if they awaked they might not follow us and raise the whole body of indians upon us with the help of our garters we tied em fast enough without waking em and made the best of our way toward the seaside all the danger we ran was in meeting with any of the other indians but we happily avoided em and came to the place where the boat lay the ship was ready to sail having got their wood and water aboard and these eight men were those that had been laboring hard in cutting wood etc and so were resolved to go up the country to view it never having been farther than the place where they felled the trees and happily for me came to give me my liberty under providence as we were getting into the boat to go on board the ship having made a waft in her ancient indian will came running down almost out of breath and cried get quick in ship they come down presently kill all me go wid you de kill me else for tell you we hurried away and indian will with us and got on board in very good time for before we were well under sail we could perceive at least two hundred indians bringing their canoes with em we had a brisk gale so that they could not well overtake us for they never go above two leagues from shore nevertheless they put their canoes in the water and began to paddle after us the captain was for firing at em with our great guns but i persuaded him against it by telling him it might be worse for other english vessels that should come after us and as they could not overtake us to do us any damage it was best not to take any notice of em when we had lost sight of dominico i asked indian will the reason of their endeavoring to detain all whites in that clandestine manner and he gave me to know that they feared if the whites should know the smallness of their number that they would put em all to death and seize upon the whole island the ship that took us up was called the twins from caroline captain fuller commander she came then from barbados and was bound for jamaica i took indian will as my servant and did design to give him some clothes as soon as we arrived at jamaica but for the present i had none for my self and made but an odd sort of a figure my beard was pretty long and being something inclining to red looked but oddly my lining was all gone so that my whole dress consisted of a hat a wastecoat a pair of breeches and a pair of shoes the captain was so kind to lend me a shirt and a pair of stockings and i got my beard off and once more looked like a christian we made jamaica without meeting with any thing material and found the fleet at anchor i went on board the admiral and paid my respects to him which he took very kindly i there once more met with my friend mr musgrave and the rest of my companions who had given me over for lost for captain walton told the admiral and my comrades that i was certainly murdered by the indians i had all my things restored me that were brought in the albion frigate that arrived about a week before me with the stores of the fleet after she had been in the dock at plymouth and well mended she also brought news of war being declared between england and france and the death of his sacred majesty king william the third of glorious memory and the coronation of her majesty queen anne july the    th   0  the whole fleet set out from jamaica in order for a descent upon st domingo as was supposed but things not answering the admiral in the breda captain fog with six other men of war viz defiance captain kirby greenwich captain wade windsor captain constable ruby captain walton falmouth captain vincent and pendennis captain hudson in quest of monsieur du casse the french commodore that was designed for america with ammunition forces provision and money to pay the garrisons besides several governors to be put in the room of others that were called back we directed our course to port leogaon where du casse was expected every day but when we came there we were informed that du casse was sailed for carthagena upon which we directed our course for that place after having taken three ships one of sixteen another of thirty called reine de angelos or the queen of angels and another of six guns richly laden beside three barks taken by captain constable in the windsor and a fourth sunk likewise a french man of war of forty guns burnt  on the    th of august o s about  0 in the morning we discovered ten sail to the eastward of us which we bore up to and found em to be the fleet we were in quest of though there was ten sail yet there was but six fighting ships the rest were storeships which made the best of their way so when the admiral came up with em we had but six to engage the line of battle was formed about three in the afternoon the defiance led the van the windsor second and benbow in the breda the third these three kept pretty close together but the other four were a league behind at four in the afternoon we began the engagement but the defiance after firing three guns bore away to leeward and lay there out of gunshot all the evening so that the whole strength of the french fleet lay upon the admiral and the windsor till it was dark in the night the windsor fell foul of our ship which startled a great many that were not upon deck as believing it might be a french fireship though we knew they had not one in the fleet but fear as well as passion blends our reason the wind chopped about in the night so that we had the weathergage of em upon which we bore down upon em and engaged for three hours but the ruby captain walton was disabld and ordered by the admiral to make for port royal my man indian will who was on board dressed like an european was terribly frighted with the noise of our guns and every time he saw the flash of our enemys cannon he would squat down upon the deck and lie flat upon his belly for some time one of our men that was shot in the guts lay expiring and indian will was getting away out of danger he said but unfortunately stumbled over the dying man who in the pangs of death grasped will so fast that he cried out lustily for help but it was more than i could do to unclench his hand till he was quite dead and then we released poor will frighted out of his wits who could not be prevailed upon to come upon deck any more till we told him we had done fighting we took one ship from the french that they had taken from the english in their voyage the fight lasted six days on and off but the admiral being wounded in the thigh and finding that wade kirby and hudson did not care for fighting we left em after disabling two of their ships and directed our course back to portugal as soon as we arrived there the admiral sent orders to confine captain constable wade kirby and hudson and summoned a courtmarshal tried em and found em guilty of cowardice excluding constable and accordingly the other three were sent to england to receive sentence of death which was executed upon two of em the third captain hudson died in the voyage and so prevented an ignominious death how easy had it been for the english to have taken the french if they had been unanimous but such an instance of pusillanimity is not to be found in the records of the navy  december the    th   0  we were all concerned with the news of admiral benbows death who died of the wound in his thigh that he received in the engagement with monsieur du casse lamented by all i observed there was a perfect groan in every ship in the fleet when the admirals flag was lord with a whiff which is the custom at sea he was buried at kingstown where he died he had several rich plantations in jamaica and many slaves he had made five successful voyages to jamaica and returned home laden with wealth and honor but the sixth proved fatal to him he had a perfect knowledge in the navigation of america having been several years captain of a privateer there he was a man beloved of both officers and common sailors a person of true courage and fortitude for when he was wounded in the engagement he ordered the carpenters to make him a cradle that he might be upon deck to give orders nothing went more near his heart than this unfortunate expedition and the surgeons reported that the grief he conceived from it hindered the healing of his wound which was given with a musketball and not a chainshot as has been reported in our public papers admiral martin as being the eldest officer supplied his place till admiral whetstone arrived in the boyne my very good friend captain hercules mitchell captain of the strombelo fireship was made captain of the windsor and admiral benbow being dead i removed my self with captain fogs leave into his ship the fleet set sail with the merchant ships for england march the   th   0  and met with nothing worthy of note  on may the   th we entered st johns harbor in new foundland and stayed there till may the    th then set sail for the bay of bulls a convenient harbor to wood and water in the same island after we had provided every thing we wanted there we weighed anchor in order to sail for england in weighing our best bower an anchor so called the nippers giving way the captstornbarrs killed us three men and broke the back of a fourth who died in a week after  november the  st we were separated from the fleet by a dreadful storm that threw all our masts by the board and our boltsprit was also sprung but we fished that which preserved it we were in a very pitiful condition and i am sure in great danger for i really heard some of the sailors at their prayers we lost two of our men who fell with the mainmast overboard the storm lasted for two days and the weather continued so hazy we could not take our observations we put up our jurymasts but could make but little way we had captain titchburns company of marines and major bowls major of the regiment that did belong to colonel jones who died in the voyage so that having above our complement our provision began to be at an ebb which obliged us all to come to halfallowance and half a pint of water a day to each man for we did not know how long we should be out at sea but we made ireland beyond all our hopes november the  0 th and got safe into gallaway harbor on the    d and it was a great providence we did so for on the    th there arose such a violent storm that must have inevitably destroyed us this was that fatal hurricane that did so much damage in england etc there was two ships in gallaway harbor that was stranded and it was allowed by every body that we should have run the same fate if our masts had been standing but having none but jurymasts which we took down when the storm began to be pretty high so that the wind could not have the same power over us neither do i think shat the storm was so violent in ireland by all description as it was in england holland and france we stayed at gallaway four months and in that time we had got masts up and repaired our other damages while the ship was fitting up i lay on shore in the town gallaway is a neat wellfortifyd town as big as salisbury yet has but one church every thing is very cheap there i had my board in a private house for four shillings per week and seldom dined without two or three dishes at table we bought the best french wine for fourteen pence per quart and sometimes under we set sail from gallaway february the    th   0  and arrived safely at plymouth thus after many misfortunes and hazards i once more set my feet upon my dear native country accompanied with indian will who still lives with me and proves an honest faithful servant and i have taken pains to have him instructed in the christian religion and likewise to have him christened by the name of william dominico from the island that he came from and though warned by many dangers i had run i could not forbear making three voyages more but yet in a station different from what i went before but as they were but common voyages that is nothing extraordinary happening i shall conclude with my prayers and thanks to heaven for the many mercies i have received wishing long life and happiness to my king prosperity peace and riches to my country and a hearty union among my fellow subjects  finis
