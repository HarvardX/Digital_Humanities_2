letters of the late rev mr laurence stern to his most intimate friends  entered in the hall book of the company of stationers according to act of parliament  lydia stern de medalle painted by b  engraved by j caldwall   august         letters of the late rev mr laurence stern to his most intimate friends  with a fragment in the manner of rabelais  to which are prefixed memoirs of his life and family written by himself and published by his daughter mrs medalle  in three volumes  vol i  london printed for t becket the corner of the adelphi in the strand       dedication to david garrick esquire when i was asked to whom i should dedicate these volumes i carelessly answered to no one  why not replied the person who put the question to me because most dedications look like begging a protection to the book perhaps a worse interpretation may be given to it no no already so much obliged i cannot will not put another tax upon the generosity of any friend of mr sternes or mine i went home to my lodgings and gratitude warmed my heart to such a pitch that i vowed they should be dedicated to the man my father so much admired  who with an unprejudiced eye read and approved his works and moreover loved the man  it is to mr garrick then that i dedicate these genuine letters  can i forget the sweet see page    epitaph which proved mr garricks friendship and opinion of him twas a tribute to friendship  and as a tribute of my gratitude i dedicate these volumes to a man of understanding and feelings  receive this as it is meant  may you dear sir approve of these letters as much as mr stern admired you  but mr garrick with all his urbanity can never carry the point half so far for mr stern was an enthusiast if it is possible to be one in favor of mr garrick  this may appear a very simple dedication but mr garrick will judge by his own sensibility that i can feel more than i can express and i believe he will give me credit for all my grateful acknowledgements  i am with every sentiment of gratitude and esteem  dear sir your obliged humble servant lydia stern de medalle london june      epitaph shall pride a heap of sculptured marble raise some worthless unmournd titled fool to praise and shall we not by one poor gravestone learn where genius wit and humor sleep with stern d g  preface in publishing these letters the editor does but comply with her mothers request which was that if any letters were published under mr sternes name that those she had in her possession as well as those that her fathers friends would be kind enough to send to her should be likewise published  she depends much on the candor of the public for the favorable reception of these  their being genuine she thinks  and hopes will render them not unacceptable  she has already experienced much benevolence and generosity from her late fathers friends  the rememberance of it will ever warm her heart with gratitude  in memory of mr stern author of the sentimental journey with wit and genuine humor to dispel from the desponding bosom gloomy care and bid the gushing tear at the sad tale of hapless love or filial grief to flow from the full sympathising heart were thine these powers oh stern but now thy fate demands no plumage nodding over the emblazond hearse proclaiming honor where no virtue shone but the sad tribute of a heartfelt sigh what though no taper cast its deadly ray nor the full choir sing requiems over thy tomb the humbler grief of friendship is not mute and poor maria with her faithful kid her auburn tresses carelessly entwined with olive foliage at the close of day shall chaunt her plaintive vespers at thy grave thy shade too gentle monk mid aweful night shall pour libations from its friendly eye for erst his sweet benevolence bestowed its generous pity and bedewed with tears the sod which rested on thy aged breast a character and eulogium of stern and his writings in a familiar epistle from a gentleman in ireland to his friend  written in the year      what trifle comes next  spare the censure my friend this letters no more from beginning to end yet when you consider your laughter pray stifle the advantage the importance the use of a trifle  when you think too beside  and there is nothing more clear  that pence compose millions and moments the year you surely will grant me nor think that i jest that lifes but a series of trifles at best how wildly digressive yet could i o stern the late reverend laurence stern a m etc author of that truly original humourous heteroclite work called the life and opinions of tristram shandy of a sentimental journey through france and italy which alas he did not live to finish and of some volumes of sermons of his skill in delineating and supporting his characters those of the father of his hero of his uncle toby and of corporal trim out of numberless others afford ample proof to his power in the pathetic whoever shall read the stories of le fevre maria the monk and the dead ass must if he has feelings bear sufficient testimony and his sermons throughout though sometimes perhaps chargeable with a levity not entirely becoming the pulpit breathe the kindest spirit of philanthropy of good will toward man for the few exceptional parts of his works those small blemishes quas aut incuria fudit aut humana parum cavit natura  suffer them kind critic to rest with his ashes  the above eulogium will i doubt not appear to you and perhaps also to many others much too high for the literary character of stern i have not at present either leisure or inclination to enter into argument upon the question but in truth i considered myself as largely his debtor for the tears and the laughter he so frequently excited and was desirous to leave behind me for so long at least as this trifle shall remain some small memorial of my gratitude i will even add that although i regard the memory of shakespeare with a veneration little short of idolatry i esteem the monks hornbox a relick as devoutly to be wished as a pipestopper a walkingstick or even an inkstand of the mulberrytree    digress with thy skill with thy freedom return the vain wish i repress  poor yorick no more shall thy mirth and thy jests set the table on a roar no more thy sad tale with simplicity told over each feeling breast its strong influence hold from the wise and the brave call forth sympathys sigh or swell with sweet anguish humanitys eye here and there in the page if a blemish appear and what page or what life from a blemish is clear trim and toby with soft intercession attend le fevre entreats you to pardon his friend maria too pleads for her favorite distressed as you feel for her sorrows o grant her request should these advocates fail i have another to call one tear of his monk shall obliterate all favored pupil of nature and fancy of yore whom from humours embrace sweet philanthropy bore while the graces and loves scatter flowers on thy urn and wit weeps the blossom too hastily torn this meed too kind spirit unoffended receive from a youth next to shakespeares who honors thy grave memoirs of the life and family of the late rev mr laurence stern roger stern grandson to archbishop stern lieutenant in hand asides regiment was married to agnes hebert widow of a captain of a good family her family name was i believe nuttle  though upon recollection that was the name of her fatherinlaw who was a noted sutler in flanders in queen anns wars where my father married his wifes daughter n b he was in debt to him which was in september         old style  this nuttle had a son by my grandmother  a fine person of a man but a graceless whelp  what became of him i know not  the family if any left live now at clomwel in the south of ireland at which town i was born november   th      a few days after my mother arrived from dunkirk  my birthday was ominous to my poor father who was the day after our arrival with many other brave officers broke and sent adrift into the wide world with a wife and two children  the elder of which was mary she was born in lisle in french flanders july the tenth one thousand seven hundred and twelve new style  this child was most unfortunate  she married one weemans in dublin  who used her most unmercifully  spent his substance became a bankrupt and left my poor sister to shift for herself  which she was able to do but for a few months for she went to a friends house in the country and died of a broken heart she was a most beautiful woman  of a fine figure and deserved a better fate  the regiment in which my father served being broke he left ireland as soon as i was able to be carried with the rest of his family and came to the family seat at elvington near york where his mother lived she was daughter to sir roger jaques and an heiress there we sojourned for about ten months when the regiment was established and our household decamped with bag and baggage for dublin  within a month of our arrival my father left us being ordered to exeter where in a sad winter my mother and her two children followed him traveling from liverpool by land to plymouth melancholy description of this journey not necessary to be transmitted here in twelve months we were all sent back to dublin  my mother with three of us for she laid in at plymouth of a boy joram took ship at bristol for ireland and had a narrow escape from being cast away by a leak springing up in the vessel  at length after many perils and struggles we got to dublin  there my father took a large house furnished it and in a year and a halfs time spent a great deal of money  in the year one thousand seven hundred and nineteen all unhinged again the regiment was ordered with many others to the isle of wight in order to embark for spain in the vigo expedition we accompanied the regiment and was driven into milford haven but landed at bristol from thence by land to plymouth again and to the isle of wight  where i remember we stayed encamped some time before the embarkation of the troops  in this expedition from bristol to hampshire we lost poor joram  a pretty boy four years old of the smallpox my mother sister and myself remained at the isle of wight during the vigo expedition and until the regiment had got back to wicklow in ireland from whence my father sent for us  we had poor jorams loss supplied during our stay in the isle of wight by the birth of a girl anne born september the twentythird one thousand seven hundred and nineteen  this pretty blossom fell at the age of three years in the barracks of dublin  she was as i well remember of a fine delicate frame not made to last long as were most of my fathers babes  we embarked for dublin and had all been cast away by a most violent storm but through the intercessions of my mother the captain was prevailed upon to turn back into wales where we stayed a month and at length got into dublin and traveled by land to wicklow where my father had for some weeks given us over for lost  we lived in the barracks at wicklow one year one thousand seven hundred and twenty when devijeher so called after colonel devijeher was born from thence we decamped to stay half a year with mr fetherston a clergyman about seven miles from wicklow who being a relation of my mothers invited us to his parsonage at animo  it was in this parish during our stay that i had that wonderful escape in falling through a millrace whilst the mill was going and of being taken up unhurt  the story is incredible but known for truth in all that part of ireland  where hundreds of the common people flocked to see me  from hence we followed the regiment to dublin where we lay in the barracks a year  in this year one thousand seven hundred and twentyone i learned to write etc  the regiment ordered in twentytwo to carrickfergus in the north of ireland we all decamped but got no further than drogheda thence ordered to mullengar forty miles west where by providence we stumbled upon a kind relation a collateral descendant from archbishop stern who took us all to his castle and kindly entreated us for a year  and sent us to the regiment at carrickfergus loaded with kindnesses etc  a most rueful and tedious journey had we all in march to carrickfergus where we arrived in six or seven days  little devijeher here died he was three years old  he had been left behind at nurse at a farmhouse near wicklow but was fetched to us by my father the summer after  another child sent to fill his place susan this babe too left us behind in this weary journey  the autumn of that year or the spring afterward i forget which my father got leave of his colonel to fix me at school  which he did near halifax with an able master with whom i staid some time till by gods care of me my cousin stern of elvington became a father to me and sent me to the university etc etc to pursue the thread of our story my fathers regiment was the year after ordered to londonderry where another sister was brought forth catherine still living but most unhappily estranged from me by my uncles wickedness and her own folly  from this station the regiment was sent to defend gibraltar at the seige where my father was run through the body by captain phillips in a duel the quarrel begun about a goose with much difficulty he survived  though with an impaired constitution which was not able to withstand the hardships it was put to  for he was sent to jamaica where he soon fell by the country fever which took away his senses first and made a child of him and then in a month or two walking about continually without complaining till the moment he sat down in an arm chair and breathed his last  which was at port antonio on the north of the island  my father was a little smart man  active to the last degree in all exercises  most patient of fatigue and disappointments of which it pleased god to give him full measure  he was in his temper somewhat rapid and hasty  but of a kindly sweet disposition void of all design and so innocent in his own intentions that he suspected no one so that you might have cheated him ten times in a day if nine had not been sufficient for your purpose  my poor father died in march       i remained at halifax till about the latter end of that year and cannot omit mentioning this anecdote of myself and schoolmaster  he had had the cieling of the schoolroom new whitewashed  the ladder remained there  i one unlucky day mounted it and wrote with a brush in large capital letters lau stern for which the usher severely whipped me my master was very much hurt at this and said before me that never should that name be effaced for i was a boy of genius and he was sure i should come to preferment  this expression made me forget the stripes i had received  in the year thirtytwo my cousin sent me to the university where i staid some time twas there that i commenced a friendship with mr h which has been most lasting on both sides  i then came to york and my uncle got me the living of sutton  and at york i become acquainted with your mother and courted her for two years  she owned she liked me but thought herself not rich enough or me too poor to be joined together  she went to her sisters in s  and i wrote to her often  i believe then she was partly determined to have me but would not say so  at her return she fell into a consumption  and one evening that i was sitting by her with an almost broken heart to see her so ill she said my dear lawrey i can never be yours for i verily believe i have not long to live  but i have left you every shilling of my fortune  upon that she showed me her will  this generosity overpowered me  it pleased god that she recovered and i married her in the year      my uncle and myself were then upon very good terms for he soon got me the prebendary of york  but he quarrelled with me afterward because i would not write paragraphs in the newspapers  though he was a partyman i was not and detested such dirty work thinking it beneath me  from that period he became my bitterest enemy  by my wifes means i got the living of stillington  a friend of here is in the south had promised her that if she married a clergyman in yorkshire when the living became vacant he would make her a compliment of it i remained near twenty years at sutton doing duty at both places  i had then very good health  books painting fiddling and shooting were my amusements as to the squire of the parish i cannot say we were upon a very friendly footing  but at stillington the family of the c  s showed us every kindness  twas most truly agreeable to be within a mile and a half of an amiable family who were ever cordial friends  in the year    0 i took a house at york for your mother and yourself and went up to london to publish my two first volumes of shandy in that year lord f  presented me with the curacy of coxwold  a sweet retirement in comparison of sutton in sixtytwo i went to france before the peace was concluded and you both followed me  i left you both in france and in two years after i went to italy for the recovery of my health  and when i called upon you i tried to engage your mother to return to england with me  she and yourself are at length come  and i have had the inexpressible joy of seeing my girl every thing i wished her  i have set down these particulars relating to my family and self for my lydia in case hereafter she might have a curiosity or a kinder motive to know them in justice to mr sternes delicate feelings i must here publish the following letters to mrs stern before he married her when she was in staffordshire  a good heart breathes in every line of them  letters letter i to miss l  yes i will steal from the world and not a babbling tongue shall tell where i am  echo shall not so much as whisper my hiding place  suffer thy imagination to paint it as a little sungilt cottage on the side of a romantic hill  do thou think i will leave love and friendship behind me no they shall be my companions in solitude for they will sit down and rise up with me in the amiable form of my l  we will be as merry and as innocent as our first parents in paradise before the arch fiend entered that undescribable scene  the kindest affections will have room to shoot and expand in our retirement and produce such fruit as madness and envy and ambition have always killed in the bud  let the human tempest and hurricane rage at a distance the desolation is beyond the horizon of peace  my l has seen a polyanthus blow in december  some friendly wall has sheltered it from the biting wind  no planetary influence shall reach us but that which presides and cherishes the sweetest flowers  god preserve us how delightful this prospect in idea we will build and we will plant in our own way  simplicity shall not be tortured by art  we will learn of nature how to live  she shall be our alchymist to mingle all the good of life into one salubrious draught  the gloomy family of care and distrust shall be banished from our dwelling guarded by thy kind and tutelar deity  we will sing our choral songs of gratitude and rejoice to the end of our pilgrimage  adieu my l return to one who languishes for thy society  l stern  letter ii to the same you bid me tell you my dear l how i bore your departure for s  and whether the valley where destella stands retains still its looks  or if i think the roses or jessamines smell as sweet as when you left it  alas every thing has now lost its relish and look the hour you left destella i took to my bed  i was worn out with fevers of all kinds but most by that fever of the heart with which thou know well i have been wasting these two years  and shall continue wasting till you quit s  the good miss s  from the forebodings of the best of hearts thinking i was ill insisted upon my going to her  what can be the cause my dear l that i never have been able to see the face of this mutual friend but i feel myself rent to pieces she made me stay an hour with her and in that short space i burst into tears a dozen different times  and in such affectionate gusts of passion that she was constrained to leave the room and sympathize in her dressing room  i have been weeping for you both said she in a tone of the sweetest pity  for poor ls heart i have long known it  her anguish is as sharp as yours  her heart as tender  her constancy as great  her virtues as heroic  heaven brought you not together to be tormented i could only answer her with a kind look and a heavy sigh  and returned home to your lodgings which i have hired till your return to resign myself to misery  fanny had prepared me a supper  she is all attention to me  but i sat over it with tears a bitter sauce my l but i could eat it with no other  for the moment she began to spread my little table my heart fainted within me  one solitary plate one knife one fork one glass  i gave a thousand pensive penetrating looks at the chair thou had so often graced in those quiet and sentimental repasts  then laid down my knife and fork and took out my handkerchief and clapped it across my face and wept like a child  i do so this very moment my l for as i take up my pen my poor pulse quickens my pale face glows and tears are trickling down upon the paper as i trace the word l  o thou blessed in thyself and in thy virtues  blessed to all that know thee  to me most so because more do i know of thee than all thy sex  this is the philtre my l by which thou have charmed me and by which thou will hold me thine whilst virtue and faith hold this world together  this my friend is the plain and simple magic by which i told miss  i have won a place in that heart of thine on which i depend so satisfied that time or distance or change of every thing which might alarm the hearts of little men create no uneasy suspense in mine  wast thou to stay in s  these seven years thy friend though he would grieve scorns to doubt or to be doubted  it is the only exception where security is not the parent of danger  i told you poor fanny was all attention to me since your departure  contrives every day bringing in the name of l she told me last night upon giving me some hartshorn she had observed my illness began the very day of your departure for s  that i had never held up my head had seldom or scarce ever smiled had fled from all society  that she verily believed i was brokenhearted for she had never entered the room or passed by the door but she heard me sigh heavily  that i neither eat or slept or took pleasure in any thing as before  judge then my l can the valley look so well  or the roses and jessamines smell so sweet as heretofore ah me  but adieu  the vesper bell calls me from thee to my god  l stern  letter iii to the same before now my l has lodged an indictment against me in the high court of friendship  i plead guilty to the charge and entirely submit to the mercy of that amiable tribunal  let this mitigate my punishment if it will not expiate my transgression  do not say that i shall offend again in the same manner though a too easy pardon sometimes occasions a repetition of the same fault  a miser says though i do no good with my money today tomorrow shall be marked with some deed of beneficence  the libertine says let me enjoy this week in forbidden and luxurious pleasures and the next i will dedicate to serious thought and reflection  the gamester says let me have one more chance with the dice and i will never touch them more  the knave of every profession wishes to obtain but independency and he will become an honest man  the female coquette triumphs in tormenting her inamorato for fear after marriage he should not pity her  thy apparition of the fifth instant for letters may almost be called so proved more welcome as i did not expect it oh my l  thou art kind indeed to make an apology for me and thou never wilt assuredly repent of one act of kindness  for being thy debtor i will pay thee with interest  why does my l complain of the desertion of friends  where does the human being live that will not join in this complaint  it is a common observation and perhaps too true that married people seldom extend their regards beyond their own fireside  there is such a thing as parsimony in esteem as well as money  yet as the one costs nothing it might be bestowed with more liberality  we cannot gather grapes from thorns so we must not expect kind attachments from persons who are wholly folded up in selfish schemes  i do not know whether i most despise or pity such characters  nature never made an unkind creature  ill usage and bad habits have deformed a fair and lovely creation  my l  thou art surrounded by all the melancholy gloom of winter were thou alone the retirement would be agreeable  disappointed ambition might envy such a retreat and disappointed love would seek it out  crowded towns and busy societies may delight the unthinking and the gay  but solitude is the best nurse of wisdom  methinks i see my contemplative girl now in the garden watching the gradual approaches of spring  do not thou mark with delight the first vernal buds the snowdrop and primrose these early and welcome visitors spring beneath thy feet  flora and pomona already consider thee as their handmaid and in a little time will load thee with their sweetest blessing  the feathered race are all thy own and with them untaught harmony will soon begin to cheer thy morning and evening walks  sweet as this may be return  return  the birds of yorkshire will tune their pipes and sing as melodiously as those of staffordshire  adieu my beloved l thine too much for my peace  l stern  letter iv to the same i have offended her whom i so tenderly love  what could tempt me to it but if a beggar was to knock at thy gate would thou not open the door and be melted with compassion  i know thou would for pity has erected a temple in thy bosom  sweetest and best of all human passions let thy web of tenderness cover the pensive form of affliction and soften the darkest shades of misery i have reconsidered this apology and alas what will it accomplish arguments however finely spun can never change the nature of things  very true  so a truce with them  i have lost a very valuable friend by a sad accident and what is worse he has left a widow and five young children to lament this sudden stroke  if real usefulness and integrity of heart could have secured him from this his friends would not now be mourning his untimely fate  these dark and seemingly cruel dispensations of providence often make the best of human hearts complain  who can paint the distress of an affectionate mother made a widow in a moment weeping in bitterness over a numerous helpless and fatherless offspring  god these are thy chastisements and require hard task a pious acquiescence  forgive me this digression and allow me to drop a tear over a departed friend and what is more excellent an honest man my l thou will feel all that kindness can inspire in the death of  the event was sudden and thy gentle spirit would be more alarmed on that account  but my l thou have less to lament as old age was creeping on and her period of doing good and being useful was nearly over  at sixty years of age the tenement gets fast out of repair and the lodger with anxiety thinks of a discharge  in such a situation the poet might well say the soul uneasy etc  my l talks of leaving the country  may a kind angel guide thy steps hither  solitude at length grows tiresome  thou say thou will quit the place with regret  i think so too  does not something uneasy mingle with the very reflection of leaving it it is like parting with an old friend whose temper and company one has long been acquainted with  i think i see you looking twenty times a day at the house  almost counting every brick and pane of glass and telling them at the same time with a sigh you are going to leave them  oh happy modification of matter they will remain insensible of thy loss  but how will thou be able to part with thy garden  the recollection of so many pleasing walks must have endeared it to you the trees the shrubs the flowers which thou reared with thy own hands  will they not droop and fade away sooner upon thy departure  who will be the successor to nurse them in thy absence  thou will leave thy name upon the myrtletree  if trees and shrubs and flowers could compose an elegy i should expect a very plaintive one upon this subject  adieu adieu believe me ever ever thine  l stern  letter v to s  c  esquire london christmas day my dear friend i have been in such a continual hurry since the moment i arrived here  what with my books and what with visiters and visitings that it was not in my power sooner to sit down and acknowledge the favor of your obliging letter and to thank you for the most friendly motives which led you to write it i am not much in pain upon what gives my kind friends at stillington so much on the chapter of noses  because as the principal satire throughout that part is levelled at those learned blockheads who in all ages have wasted their time and much learning upon points as foolish  it shifts off the idea of what you fear to another point  and it is thought here very good  twill pass muster  i mean not with all  no  no i shall be attacked and pelted either from cellars or garrets write what i will  and besides must expect to have a party against me of many hundreds  who either do not  or will not laugh  it is enough if i divide the world  at least i will rest contented with it  i wish you was here to see what changes of looks and political reasoning have taken place in every company and coffeehouse since last year we shall be soon prussians and antiprussians b  s and antib  s and those distinctions will just do as well as whig and tory  and for aught i know serve the same ends  the k seems resolved to bring all things back to their original principles and to stop the torrent of corruption and laziness  he rises every morning at six to do business  rides out at eight to a minute returns at nine to give himself up to his people  by persisting it is thought he will oblige his ms and dependants to dispatch affairs with him many hours sooner than of late  and it is much to be questioned whether they will not be enabled to wait upon him sooner by being freed from long levees of their own and applications which will in all likelihood be transferred from them directly to himself  the present system being to remove that phalanx of great people which stood betwixt the throne and the subjects and suffer them to have immediate access without the intervention of a caball  this is the language of others however the k gives every thing himself knows every thing and weighs every thing maturely and then is inflexible  this puts old stagers off their game  how it will end we are all in the dark  it is feared the war is quite over in germany never was known such havoc amongst troops  i was told yesterday by a colonel from germany that out of two battalions of nine hundred men to which he belonged but seventyone left  p f has sent word it is said that he must have fortythousand men directly sent to take the field  and with provisions for them too for he can but subsist them for a fortnight  i hope this will find you all got to york  i beg my compliments to the amiable mrs croft etc etc  though i purposed going first to goldensquare yet fate has thus long disposed of me  so i have never been able to set a foot toward that quarter  i am dear sir yours affectionately l stern  letter vi to the same my dear sir i have just time to acknowledge the favor of yours but not to get the two prints you mention  which shall be sent you by next post  i have bought them and lent them to miss gilbert but will assuredly send for them and enclose them to you  i will take care to get your pictures well copied and at a moderate price and if i can be of further use i beseech you to employ me and from time to time will send you an account of whatever may be worth transmitting  the stream now sets in strong against the german war loud complaints of    making a trade of the war etc etc much expected from ld g  s evidence to these matters who is expected every hour  the k wins every day upon the people shows himself much at the play but at no opera rides out with his brothers every morning half an hour after seven till nine  returns with them  spends an hour with them at breakfast and chat  and then sits down to business i never dined at home once since i arrived  am fourteen dinners deep engaged just now and fear matters will be worse with me in that point than better  as to the main points in view at which you hint  all i can say is that i see my way and unless old nick throws the dice  shall in due time come off winner  tristram will be out the twentieth  there is a great rout made about him before he enters the stage  whether this will be of use or no i cannot say  some wits of the first magnitude here both as to wit and station engage me success  time will show  adieu dear sir and with my compliments to mrs croft etc  i am your affectionate and obliged l stern  letter vii to the same dear sir i this moment received the favor of your kind letter  the letter in the ladies magazine about me was wrote by the noted dr h  who wrote the inspector and undertakes that magazine  the people of york are very uncharitable to suppose any man so gross a beast as to pen such a character of himself  in this great town no soul ever suspected it for a thousand reasons  could they suppose i should be such a fool as to fall foul upon dr w  n my best friend by representing him so weak a man  or by telling such a lie of him  as his giving me a purse to buy off his tutorship for tristram  or i should be fool enough to own i had taken his purse for that purpose  you must know there is a quarrel between dr h  and dr m  y who was the physician meant at mr c  s  s and dr h  has changed the place on purpose to give m  y a lick  now that conversation though perhaps true yet happened at another place and with another physician which i have contradicted in this city for the honor of my friend m  y all which shows the absurdity of york credulity and nonsense besides the account is full of falsehoods  first with regard to the place of my birth which was at c  in ireland  the story of a hundred pounds to mrs w  not true or of a pension promised the merit of which i disclaimed  and indeed there are so many other things so untrue and unlikely to come from me that the worst enemy i have here never had a suspicion  and to end all dr h  owns the paper  i shall be down before may is out  i preach before the judges on sunday  my sermons come out on thursday after  and i purpose the monday at furthest after that to set out for york  i have bought a pair of horses for that purpose  my best respects to your lady   i am dear sir your most obliged and faithful l stern ps i beg pardon for this hasty scrawl having just come from a concert where the d of y performed  i have received great notice from him and last week had the honor of supping with him    letter viii to the same dear sir since i had the favor of your obliging letter nothing has happened or been said one day which has not been contradicted the next so having little certain to write i have forbore writing at all in hopes every day of something worth filling up a letter we had the greatest expectations yesterday that ever were raised of a pitched battle in the h  of c  wherein mr p  was to have entered and thrown down the gauntlet in defense of the german war  there never was so full a house  the gallery full to the top  i was there all the day  when lo a political fit of the gout seized the great combattant  he entered not the lists  b got up and begged the house as he saw not his right honorable friend there to put off the debate  it could not be done so b rose up and made a most long passionate incoherent speech in defense of the germanick war  but very severe upon the unfrugal manner it was carried on  in which he addressed himself principally to the c  of the e  and laid him on terribly  it seems the chancery of hanover had laid out   0000 pounds on account and brought in our treasury debtor  and the grand debate was for an honest examination of the particulars of this extravagant account and for vouchers to authenticate it  l answered b very rationally and coolly  lord n spoke long  sir f d  maintained the german war was most pernicious  mr c  of surry spoke well against the account with some others  l b  n at last got up and spoke half an hour with great plainness and temper  explained a great many hidden springs relating to these accounts in favor of the late k  and told two or three conversations which had passed between the k and himself relative to these expenses  which cast great honor upon the ks character this was with regard to the money the k had secretly furnished out of his pocket to lessen the account of the hanoverscore brought us to discharge  b  d and b  n abused all who sought for peace and joined in the cry for it and b  d added that the reasons of wishing a peace now were the same as at the peace of utretch  that the people behind the curtain could not both maintain the war and their places too so were for making another sacrifice of the nation to their own interests  after all  the cry for a peace is so general that it will certainly end in one now for myself   one half of the town abuse my book as bitterly as the other half cry it up to the skies  the best is they abuse and buy it and at such a rate that we are going on with a second edition as fast as possible  i am going down for a day or two with mr spencer to wimbleton on wednesday there is to be a grand assembly at lady n  i have enquired every where about stephens affair and can hear nothing  my friend mr charles t  will be now secretary of war  he bid me wish him joy of it though not in possession  i will ask him  and depend my most worthy friend that you shall not be ignorant of what i learn from him  believe me ever ever  yours l s  letter ix to the same my dear sir a strain which i got in my wrist by a terrible fall prevented my acknowledging the favor of your obliging letter i went yesterday morning to breakfast with mr v  who is a kind of right hand man to the secretary on purpose to enquire about the propriety or feasibility of doing what you wish me  and he has told me an anecdote which had you been here would i think have made it wiser to have deferred speaking about the affair a month hence than now it is this  you must know that the numbers of officers who have left their regiments in germany for the pleasures of the town have been a long topic for merriment as you see them in st jamess coffeehouse and the park every hour enquiring open mouth how things go on in germany and what news  when they should have been there to have furnished news themselves  but the worst part has been that many of them have left their brother officers on their duty and in all the fatigues of it and have come with no end but to make friends to be put unfairly over the heads of those who were left risking their lives  in this attempt there have been some but too successful which has justly raised illblood and complaints from the officers who staid behind  the upshot has been that they have every soul been ordered off and woe be to him it is said who shall be found listening now just to mention our friends case whilst this cry is on foot i think would be doing more hurt than good but if you think otherwise i will go with all my heart and mention it to mr t for to do more i am too inconsiderable a person to pretend to you made me and my friends here very merry with the accounts current at york of my being forbid the court  but they do not consider what a considerable person they make of me when they suppose either my going or my not going there is a point that ever enters the ks head  and for those about him i have the honor either to stand so personally well known to them or to be so well represented by those of the first rank as to fear no accident of that kind  i thank god bs excepted i have never yet made a friend or connection i have forfeited or done ought to forfeit  but on the contrary my true character is better understood and where i had one friend last year who did me honor i have three now  if my enemies knew that by this rage of abuse and ill will they were effectually serving the interests both of myself and works they would be more quiet  but it has been the fate of my betters who have found that the way to fame is like the way to heaven  through much tribulation  and till i shall have the honor to be as much maltreated as rabelais and swift were i must continue humble for i have not filled up the measure of half their persecutions  the court is turning topsyturvy lord be le premier  lord tt to be groom of the chambers in room of the d of rd  lord hx to ireland  sir f dd in ts place  pt seems unmoved  a peace

by what you say in your letter that i am busy writing an extraordinary book that your intelligence comes from york  the fountainhead of chitchat news  and  no matter  now for your desire of knowing the reason of my turning author why truly i am tired of employing my brains for other peoples advantage  it is a foolish sacrifice i have made for some years to an ungrateful person  i depend much upon the candor of the public but i shall not pick out a jury to try the merit of my book amongst  and  till you read my tristram do not like some people condemn it  laugh i am sure you will at some passages  i have hired a small house in the minster yard for my wife and daughter  the latter is to begin dancing etc if i cannot leave her a fortune i will at least give her an education  as i shall publish my works very soon i shall be in town by march and shall have the pleasure of meeting with you  all your friends are well and ever hold you in the same estimation that your sincere friend does  adieu dear lady believe me with every wish for your happiness your most faithful etc  laurence stern  letter xii to dr  jan  0    0 dear sir  de mortuis nil nisi bonum is a maxim which you have so often of late urged in conversation and in your letters but in your last especially with such seriousness and severity against me as the supposed transgressor of the rule  that you have made me at length as serious and severe as yourself  but that the humors you have stirred up might not work too potently within me i have waited four days to cool myself before i would set pen to paper to answer you  de mortuis nil nisi bonum i declare i have considered the wisdom and foundation of it over and over again as dispassionately and charitably as a good christian can and after all i can find nothing in it or make more of it than a nonsensical lullaby of some nurse put into latin by some pedant to be chanted by some hypocrite to the end of the world for the consolation of departing lechers  it is i own latin and i think that is all the weight it has  for in plain english it is a loose and futile position below a dispute   you are not to speak any thing of the dead but what is good why so  who says so  neither reason or scripture  inspired authors have done otherwise  and reason and common sense tell me that if the characters of past ages and men are to be drawn at all they are to be drawn like themselves that is with their excellencies and with their foibles  and it is as much a piece of justice to the world and to virtue too to do the one as the other  the ruleing passion et les egarements du coeur are the very things which mark and distinguish a mans character  in which i would as soon leave out a mans head as his hobbyhorse  however if like the poor devil of a painter we must conform to this pious canon de mortuis etc which i own has a spice of piety in the sound of it and be obliged to paint both our angels and our devils out of the same pot  i then infer that our sydenhams and sangrados our lucretias  and massalinas our summers and our bolingbrokes  are alike entitled to statues and all the historians or satirists who have said otherwise since they departed this life from sallust to s  e are guilty of the crimes you charge me with cowardice and injustice  but why cowardice because it is not courage to attack a dead man who cannot defend himself  but why do you doctors of the faculty attack such a one with your incision knife oh for the good of the living  it is my plea  but i have something more to say in my behalf  and it is this  i am not guilty of the charge  though defensible i have not cut up doctor kunastrokius at all  i have just scratched him  and that scarce skindeep  i do him first all honor  speak of kunastrokius as a great man  be he who he will and then most distantly hint at a drole foible in his character  and that not first reported to the few who can even understand the hint by me  but known before by every chambermaid and footman within the bills of mortality  but kunastrokius you say was a great man  it is that very circumstance which makes the pleasantry  for i could name at this instant a score of honest gentlemen who might have done the very thing which kunastrokius did and seen no joke in it at all  as to the failing of kunstrokius which you say can only be imputed to his friends as a misfortune  i see nothing like a misfortune in it to any friend or relation of kunastrokius  that kunastrokius upon occasions should sit with  and   i have put these stars not to hurt your worships delicacy  if kunastrokius after all is too sacred a charactter to be even smiled at which is all i have done he has had better luck than his betters  in the same page without imputation of cowardice i have said as much of a man of twice his wisdom  and that is solomon of whom i have made the same remark that they were both great men  and like all mortal men had each their ruling passion   the consolation you give me that my book however will be read enough to answer my design of raising a tax upon the public  is very unconsolatory  to say nothing how very mortifying by h  n an author is worse treated than a common  at this rate   you will get a penny by your sins and that is enough  upon this chapter let me comment  that i proposed laying the world under contribution when i set pen to paper  is what i own and i suppose i may be allowed to have that view in my head in common with every other writer to make my labor of advantage to myself  do not you do the same but i beg i may add that whatever views i had of that kind i had other views  the first of which was the hopes of doing the world good by ridiculing what i thought deserving of it  or of disservice to sound learning etc  how i have succeeded my book must show  and this i leave entirely to the world  but not to that little world of your acquaintance whose opinion and sentiments you call the general opinion of the best judges without exception who all affirm you say that my book cannot be put into the hands of any woman of character i hope you except widows doctor  for they are not all so squeamish  but i am told they are all really of my party in return for some good offices done their interests in the    th page of my second volume but for the chaste married and chaste unmarried part of the sex  they must not read my book heaven forbid the stock of chastity should be lessened by the life and opinions of tristram shandy  yes his opinions  it would certainly debauch em god take them under his protection in this fiery trial and send us plenty of duenas to watch the workings of their humors till they have safely got through the whole work  if this will not be sufficient may we have plenty of sangrados to pour in plenty of cold water till this terrible fermentation is over  as for the nummum in loculo which you mention to me a second time i fear you think me very poor or in debt  i thank god though i dont abound  that i have enough for a clean shirt every day  and a mutton chop  and my contentment with this has thus far and i hope ever will put me above stooping an inch for it for  estate  curse on it i like it not to that degree nor envy you may be sure any man who kneels in the dirt for it  so that howsoever i may fall short of the ends proposed in commencing author  i enter this protest first that my end was honest and secondly that i wrote not be fed but to be famous i am much obliged to mr garrick for his very favorable opinion  but why dear sir had he done better in finding fault with it than in commending it to humble me an author is not so soon humbled as you imagine  no but to make the book better by castrations  that is still sub judice and i can assure you upon this chapter that the very passages and descriptions you propose that i should sacrifice in my second edition are what are best relished by men of wit and some others whom i esteem as sound critics  so that upon the whole i am still kept up if not above fear at least above despair and have seen enough to show me the folly of an attempt of castrating my book to the prudish humors of particulars i believe the short cut would be to publish this letter at the beginning of the third volume as an apology for the first and second i was sorry to find a censure upon the insincerity of some of my friends  i have no reason myself to reproach any one man  my friends have continued in the same opinions of my books which they first gave me of it  many indeed have thought better of em by considering them more few worse  i am sir your humble servant laurence stern  letter xiii to the b  of g  york june      0 my lord not knowing where to send two sets of my sermons i could think of no better expedient than to order them into mr berrengers hands who has promised me that he will wait upon your lordship with them the first moment he hears you are in town the truest and humblest thanks i return to your lordship for the generosity of your protection and advice to me by making a good use of the one i will hope to deserve the other i wish your lordship all the health and happiness in this world for i am  your lordships most obliged and most grateful servant l stern ps i am just sitting down to go on with tristram etc  the scribblers use me ill but they have used my betters much worse for which may god forgive them    letter xiv to the rev mr stern priorpark june       0 reverend sir i have your favor of the  th instant and am glad to understand you are got safe home and employed again in your proper studies and amusements you have it in your power to make that which is an amusement to yourself and others useful to both at least you should above all things beware of its becoming hurtful to either by any violations of decency and good manners but i have already taken such repeated liberties of advising you on that head that to say more would be needless or perhaps unacceptable  whoever is in any way well received by the public is sure to be annoyed by that pest of the public profligate scribblers this is the common lot of successful adventurers but such have often a worse evil to struggle with i mean the overofficiousness of their indiscreet friends there are two odes as they are called printed by dodsley whoever was the author he appears to be a monster of impiety and lewdness  yet such is the malignity of the scribblers some have given them to your friend hall and others which is still more impossible to yourself though the first ode has the insolence to place you both in a mean and a ridiculous light but this might arise from a tale equally groundless and maglignant that you had shown them to your acquaintances in m s before they were given to the public nor was their being printed by dodsley the likeliest means of discrediting the calumny  about this time another under the mask of friendship pretended to draw your character which was since published in a female magazine for dullness who often has as great a hand as the devil in deforming gods works of the creation has made them it seems male and female and from thence it was transformed into a chronicle pray have you read it or do you know its author  but of all these things i dare say mr garrick whose prudence is equal to his honesty or his talents has remonstrated to you with the freedom of a friend he knows the inconstancy of what is called the public toward all even the best intentioned of those who contribute to its pleasure or amusement he as every man of honor and discretion would has availed himself of the public favor to regulate the taste and in his proper station to reform the manners of the fashionable world while by a well judged economy he has provided against the temptations of a mean and servile dependency on the follies and vices of the great  in a word be assured there is no one more sincerely wishes your welfare and happiness than  reverend sir w g  letter xiv to my witty widow mrs f  coxwould aug      0 madam when a mans brains are as dry as a squeezed orange  and he feels he has no more conceit in him than a mallet it is in vain to think of sitting down and writing a letter to a lady of your wit unless in the honest johntrotstile of yours of the    th instant came safe to hand etc which by the bye looks like a letter of business and you know very well from the first letter i had the honor to write to you i am a man of no business at all this vile plight i found my genius in was the reason i have told mr  i would not write to you till the next post  hopeing by that time to get some small recruit at least of vivacity if not wit to set out with  but upon second thoughts thinking a bad letter in season  to be better than a good one out of it  this scrawl is the consequence which if you will burn the moment you get it  i promise to send you a fine set essay in the style of your female epistolizers cut and trimmed at all points  god defend me from such who never yet knew what it was to say or write one premeditated word in my whole life  for this reason i send you with pleasure because wrote with the careless irregularity of an easy heart  who told you garrick wrote the medley for beard  twas wrote in his house however and before i left town  i deny it  i was not lost two days before i left town  i was lost all the time i was there and never found till i got to this shandy castle of mine  next winter i intend to sojourn amongst you with more decorum and will neither be lost or found any where  now i wish to god i was at your elbow  i have just finished one volume of shandy and i want to read it to some one who i know can taste and relish humor  this by the way is a little impudent in me  for i take the thing for granted which their high mightinesses the world have yet to determine  but i mean no such thing  i could wish only to have your opinion  shall i in truth give you mine  i dare not  but i will provided you keep it to yourself  know then that i think there is more laughable humor  with equal degree of cervantick satire  if not more than in the last  but we are bad judges of the merit of our children  i return you a thousand thanks for your friendly congratulations upon my habitation  and i will take care you shall never wish me but well for i am madam  with great esteem and truth your most obliged

hard as can be and thank you most cordially my dear lady for your letter of congratulation upon my lord fauconbergs having presented me with the curacy of this place  though your congratulation comes somewhat of the latest as i have been possessed of it some time  i hope i have been of some service to his lordship and he has sufficiently requited me  it is seventy guineas a year in my pocket though worth a hundred  but it obliges me to have a curate to officiate at sutton and stillington  it is within a mile of his lordships seat and park it is a very agreeable ride out in the chaise i purchased for my wife  lyd has a poney which she delights in  whilst they take these diversions i am scribbling away at my tristram these two volumes are i think the best  i shall write as long as i live it is in fact my hobbyhorse and so much am i delighted with my uncle tobys imaginary character that i am become an enthusiast  my lydia helps to copy for me  and my wife knits and listens as i read her chapters  the coronation of his majesty whom god preserve has cost me the value of an ox which is to be roasted whole in the middle of the town and my parishioners will i suppose be very merry upon the occasion  you will then be in town  and feast your eyes with a sight which it is to be hoped will not be in either of our powers to see again  for in point of age we have about twenty years the start of his majesty  and now my dear friend i must finish this  and with every wish for your happiness conclude myself your most sincere wellwisher and friend  l stern  letter xvi to j  h

thin deathdoing pestiferous northeast wind blows in a line directly from crazycastle turret full upon me in this cuckoldly retreat for i value the northeast wind and all its powers not a straw  but the transition from rapid motion to absolute rest was too violent  i should have walked about the streets of york ten days as a proper medium to have passed through before i entered upon my rest  i staid but a moment and i have been here but a few to satisfy me i have not managed my miseries like a wise man  and if god for my consolation under them had not poured forth the spirit of shandeism into me which will not suffer me to think two moments upon any grave subject i would else just now lay down and die  die  and yet in half an hours time i will lay a guinea i shall be as merry as a monkey  and as mischievous too and forget it all  so that this is but a copy of the present train running cross my brain  and so you think this cursed stupid  but that my dear h depends much upon the quota hora of your shabby clock if the pointer of it is in any quarter between ten in the morning or four in the afternoon  i give it up  or if the day is obscured by dark engendering clouds of either wet or dry weather i am still lost  but who knows but it may be five  and the day as fine a day as ever shone upon the earth since the destruction of sodom  and peradventure your honor may have got a good hearty dinner today and eat and drank your intellectuals into a placidulish and a blandulish amalgama  to bear nonsense so much for that  it is as cold and churlish just now as if god had not pleased it to be so it ought to have been in bleak december and therefore i am glad you are where you are and where i repeat it again i wish i was also  curse of poverty and absence from those we love  they are two great evils which embitter all things  and yet with the first i am not haunted much  as to matrimony i should be a beast to rail at it for my wife is easy  but the world is not  and had i staid from her a second longer it would have been a burning shame  else she declares herself happier without me  but not in anger is this declaration made  but in pure sober goodsense built on sound experience  she hopes you will be able to strike a bargain for me before this time twelvemonth to lead a bear round europe and from this hopes from you i verily believe it is that you are so high in her favor at present  she swears you are a fellow of wit though humourous a funny jolly soul though somewhat splenetic and bating the love of women as honest as gold  how do you like the simile  oh lord now are you going to ranelagh tonight and i am sitting sorrowful as the prophet was when the voice cried out to him and said what do thou here elijah  it is well the spirit does not make the same

love good company to live righteously and soberly as you do and then they will have no doubts or dangers within or without them  present my best and warmest wishes to them and advise the eldest to

the french comedy i seldom visit it  they act scarce any thing but tragedies  and the clairon is great and madlle dumesnil in some places still greater than her  yet i cannot bear preaching  i fancy i got a surfeit of it in my younger days  there is a tragedy to be damned tonight  peace be with it and the gentle brain which made it i have ten thousand things to tell you i cannot write  i do a thousand things which cut no figure but in the doing  and as in london i have the honor of having done and said a thousand things i never did or dreamed of  and yet i dream abundantly  if the devil stood behind me in the shape of a courier i could not write faster than i do having five letters more to dispatch by the same gentleman he is going into another section of the globe and when he has seen you he will depart in peace  the duke of orleans has suffered my portrait to be added to the number of some odd men in his collection and a gentleman who lives with him has taken it most expressively at full length  i purpose to obtain an etching of it and to send it you  your prayer for me of rosy health is heard  if i stay here for three or four months i shall return more than reinstated my love to mrs g  i am my dear g your most humble servant l stern  letter xxi to the same paris april  0      my dear g i snatch the occasion of mr wilcox the late bishop of rochesters son leaving this place for england to write to you and i enclose it to hall who will put it into your hand possibly behind the scenes i hear no news of you or your empire i would have said kingdom  but here every thing is hyperbolized  and if a woman is but simply pleased  it is je suis charmee  and if she is charmed it is nothing less than that she is ravishd  and when ravishd which may happen there is nothing left for her but to fly to the other world for a metaphor and swear quelle etoit toute exiasiee  which mode of speaking is by the bye here creeping into use and there is scarce a woman who understands the bon ton but is seven times in a day in downright ecstasy  that is the devils in her  by a small mistake of one world for the other  now where am i got  i have been these two days reading a tragedy given me by a lady of talents to read and conjecture if it would do for you  it is from the plan of diderot and possibly half a translation of it  the natural son or the triumph virtue in five acts  it has too much sentiment in it at least for me the speeches too long and savor too much of preaching  this may be a second reason it is not to my taste  it is all love love love throughout without much separation in the character so i fear it would not do for your stage and perhaps for the very reason which recommend it to a french one  after a vile suspension of three weeks  we are beginning with our comedies and operas again  yours i hear never flourished more  here the comic actors were never so low  the tragedians hold up their heads  in all senses i have known one little man support the theatrical world like a david atlas upon his shoulders but preville cannot do half as much here though mad clairon stands by him and sets her back to his  she is very great however and highly improved since you saw her  she also supports her dignity at table and has her public day every thursday when she gives to eat as they say here to all that are hungry and dry  you are much talked of here and much expected as soon as the peace will let you  these two last days you have happened to engross the whole conversation at two great houses where i was at dinner  it is the greatest problem in nature in this meridian that one and the same man should possess such tragic and comic powers and in such an equilibrio as to divide the world for which of the two nature intended him  crebillion has made a convention with me which if he is not too lazy will be no bad persiflage  as soon as i get to thoulouse he has agreed to write me an expostulatry letter upon the indecorums of t shandy  which is to be answered by recrimination upon the liberties in his own works  these are to be printed together  crebillion against stern  stern against crebillion  the copy to be sold and the money equally divided  this is good swisspolicy  i am recovered greatly and if i could spend one whole winter at toulouse i should be fortified in my inner man beyond all danger of relapsing  a sad asthma my daughter has been martyred with these three winters but mostly this last makes it i fear necessary she should try the last remedy of a warmer and softer air so i am going this week to versailles to wait upon count choiseul to solicit passports for them  if this system takes place they join me here  and after a months stay we all decamp for the south of france  if not i shall see you in june next mr fox and mr macartny having left paris i live altogether in french families  i laugh till i cry and in the same tender moments cry till i laugh i shandy it more than ever and verily do believe that by mere shandeism sublimated by a laughterloving people i fence as much against infirmities as i do by the benefit of air and climate adieu dear g present ten thousand of my best respects and wishes to and for my friend mrs g  had she been last night upon the tulleries she would have annihilated a thousand french goddesses in one single turn  i am most truly my dear friend l stern  letter xxii to mrs s  york paris    th      my dear it is a thousand to one that this reaches you before you have set out  however i take the chance  you will receive one wrote last night the moment you get to mr e and to wish you joy of your arrival in town  to that letter which you will find in town i have nothing to add that i can think on  for i have almost drained my brains dry upon the subject  for god sake rise early and gallop away in the cool  and always see that you have not forgot your baggage in changing postchaises  you will find good tea upon the road from york to dover  only bring a little to carry you from calais to paris  give the customhouse officers what i told you  at calais give more if you have much scotch snuff  but as tobacco is good here you had best bring a scotch mill and make it yourself that is order your valet to manufacture it  twill keep him out of mischief  i would advise you to take three days in coming up for fear of heating yourselves  see that they do not give you a bad vehicle when a better is in the yard but you will look sharp  drink small rhenish to keep you cool that is if you like it live well and deny yourselves nothing your hearts wish so god in heaven prosper and go along with you  kiss my lydia and believe me both affectionately  yours l stern  letter xxiii to the same paris          my dear there have no mails arrived here till this morning for three posts so i expected with great impatience a letter from you and lydia  and lo it is arrived you are as busy as throps wife and by the time you receive this you will be busier still  i have exhausted all my ideas about your journey  and what is needful for you to do before and during it  so i write only to tell you i am well  mr colebrooks the minister of swisserlands secretary i got this morning to write a letter for you to the governor of the customhouseoffice at calais  it shall be sent you next post  you must be cautious about scotch snuff  take half a pound in your pocket and make lyd do the same it is well i bought you a chaise  there is no getting one in paris now but at an enormous price  for they are all sent to the army and such a one as yours we have not been able to match for forty guineas for a friend of mine who is going from hence to italy  the weather was never known to set in so hot as it has done the latter end of this month so he and his party are to get into his chaises by four in the morning and travel till nine  and not stir out again till six but i hope this severe heat will abate by the time you come here  however i beg of you once more to take special care of heating your blood in traveling and come tout doucement when you find the heat too much  i shall look impatiently for intelligence from you and hope to hear all goes well that you conquer all difficulties that you have received your passport my picture etc write and tell me something of every thing i long to see you both you may be assured my dear wife and child after so long a separation  and write me a line directly that i may have all the notice you can give me that i may have apartments ready and fit for you when you arrive  for my own part i shall continue writing to you a fortnight longer  present my respects to all friends  you have bid mr c get my visitations at p done for me etc etc if any offers are made about the enclosure at rascal they must be enclosed to me  nothing that is fairly proposed shall stand still on my score do all for the best as he who guides all things will i hope do for us  so heaven preserve you both  believe me  your affectionate l stern love to my lydia  i have bought her a gold watch to present to her when she comes    letter xxiv to the same paris       my dear i keep my promise and write to you again  i am sorry the bureau must be opened for the deeds  but you will see it done  i imagine you are convinced of the necessity of bringing three hundred pounds in your pocket  if you consider lydia must have two slight negligees  you will want a new gown or two  as for painted linens buy them in town they will be more admired because english than french  mrs h writes me word that i am mistaken about buying silk cheaper at toulouse than paris that she advises you to buy what you want here  where they are very beautiful and cheap as well as blonds gauzes etc  these i say will all cost you sixty guineas  and you must have them  for in this country nothing must be spared for the back  and if you dine on an onion and lay in a garret seven stories high you must not betray it in your clothes according to which you are well or ill looked on when we are got to toulouse we must begin to turn the penny and we may if you do not game much live very cheap  i think that expression will divert you  and now god knows i have not a wish but for your health comfort and safe arrival here  write to me every other post that i may know how you go on  you will be in raptures with your chariot  mr r a gentleman of fortune who is going to italy and has seen it has offered me thirty guineas for my bargain  you will wonder all the way how i am to find room in it for a third  to ease you of this wonder it is by what the coachmakers here call a cave which is a second bottom added to that you set your feet upon which lets the person who sits over against you down with his knees to your ancles and by which you have all more room  and what is more less heat  because his head does not intercept the soreglass little or nothing  lyd and i will enjoy this by turns sometimes i shall take a bidet  a little post horse and scamper before  at other times i shall sit in fresco upon the armchair without doors and one way or other will do very well  i am under infinite obligations to mr thornhil for accommodating me thus and so genteely for it is like making a present of it  mr t  will send you an order to receive it at calais  and now my dear girls have i forgot any thing  adieu adieu yours most affectionately l stern a week or ten days will enable you to see every thing  and so long you must stay to rest your bones    letter xxv to the same paris june         my dearest having an opportunity of writing by a friend who is setting out this morning for london i write again in case the two last letters i have wrote this week to you should be be detained by contrary winds at calais  i have wrote to mr e  by the same hand to thank him for his kindness to you in the handsomest manner i could  and have told him his good heart and his wifes have made them overlook the trouble of having you at his house but that if he takes you apartments near him they will have occasion still enough left to show their friendship to us  i have begged him to assist you and stand by you as if he was in my place with regard to the sale of the shandys  and then the copyright  mark to keep these things distinct in your head  but becket i have ever found to be a man of probity and i dare say you will have very little trouble in finishing matters with him  and i would rather wish you to treat with him than with another man  but whoever buys the fifth and sixth volumes of shandys must have the naysay of the seventh and eighth  i wish when you come here in case the weather is too hot to travel you could think it pleasant to go to the spaw for four or six weeks where we should live for half the money we should spend at paris  after that we should take the sweetest season of the vintage to go to the south of france  but we will put our heads together and you shall just do as you please in this and in every thing which depends on me  for i am a being perfectly contented when others are pleased  to bear and forbear will ever be my maxim  only i fear the heats through a journey of five hundred miles for you and my lydia more than for myself  do not forget the watch chains  bring a couple for a gentlemans watch likewise we shall lie under great obligations to the abbe m and must make him such a small acknowledgement according to my way of flourishing twill be a present worth a kingdom to him  they have bad pins and vile needles here  bring for yourself and some for presents  as also a strong bottleskrew for whatever scrub we may hire as butler coachman etc to uncork us our frontiniac  you will find a letter for you at the lion dargent  send for your chaise into the courtyard and see all is tight  buy a chain at calais strong enough not to be cut off and let your portmanteau be tied on the forepart of your chaise for fear of a dogs trick  so god bless you both and remember me to my lydia  i am yours affectionately l stern  letter xxvi to the same paris june      my dearest probably you will receive another letter with this by the same post if so read this the last  it will be the last you can possibly receive at york for i hope it will catch you just as you are upon the wing  if that should happen i suppose in course you have executed the contents of it in all things which relate to pecuniary matters and when these are settled to your mind you will have got through your last difficulty  every thing else will be a step of pleasure and by the time you have got half a dozen stages you will set up your pipes and sing te deum together as you whisk it along  desire mr c  to send me a proper letter of attorney by you he will receive it back by return of post you have done every thing well with regard to our sutton and stillington affairs and left things in the best channel  if i was not sure you must have long since got my picture garnets etc i would write and scold mr t  abominably  he put them in beckets hands to be forwarded by the stage coach to you as soon as he got to town  i long to hear from you and that all my letters and things are come safe to you and then you will say that i have not been a bad lad  for you will find i have been writing continually as i wished you to do  bring your silver coffeepot twill serve both to give water lemonade and orjead  to say nothing of coffee and chocolate which by the bye is both cheap and good at toulouse like other things  i had like to have forgot a most necessary thing there are no copper teakettles to be had in france and we shall find such a thing the most comfortable utensil in the house  buy a good strong one which will hold two quarts  a dish of tea will be of comfort to us in our journey south  i have a bronze teapot which we will carry also as china cannot be brought over from england we must make up a villainous partycolored tea equipage to regale ourselves and our english friends whilst we are at toulouse  i hope you have got your bill from becket  there is a good natured kind of a trader i have just heard of at mr foleys who they think will be coming off from england to france with horses the latter end of june he happened to come over with a lady who is sister to mr foleys partner and i have got her to write a letter to him in london this post to beg he will seek you out at mr e  s and in case a cartel ship does not go off before he goes to take you under his care he was infinitely friendly in the same office last year to the lady who now writes to him and nursed her on shipboard and defended her by land with great goodwill  do not say i forget you or whatever can be conducive to your ease of mind in this journey  i wish i was with you to do these offices myself and to strew roses on your way  but i shall have time and occasion to show you i am not wanting  now my dears once more pluck up your spirits  trust in god  in me  and in yourselves  with this was you put to it you would encounter all these difficulties ten times told  write instantly and tell me you triumph over all fears tell me lydia is better and a helpmate to you  you say she grows like me  let her show me she does so in her comtempt of small dangers and fighting against the apprehensions of them which is better still as i will not have fs share of the books you will inform him so  give my love to mr fothergill and to those true friends which envy has spared me  and for the rest laisses passer  you will find i speak french tolerably  but i only wish to be understood  you will soon speak better a months play with a french demoiselle will make lyd chatter it like a magpye mrs  understood not a word of it when she got here and writes me word she
