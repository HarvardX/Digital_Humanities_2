the school for guardians  a comedy  as it is performing at the theater royal in covent garden   sabitum et miserabile longum attendit thymele thymele tune rustica discit juv london printed for p vaillant in the strand mdcclxvii  price one shilling and six pence  advertisement the following play was written above three years ago and was soon after shown to some of the principal performers of both houses it took its rise from miss elliots being advised to revive the country wife for her benefit the first season of her engagement at covent garden theater that play upon a review of it appeared inadmissible on account of the obscenity which discolours the whole the author or rather the compiler of the ensuing scenes undertook to alter wycherleys play for miss elliot against the following winter but hearing in the mean time that mr bickerstaff had employed himself upon one of wycherleys pieces he made it his business to see that gentleman lest this writer should interfere with a plan already preoccupied he found that the plain dealer had been mr bickerstaffs object and that there was no danger of clashing with the scheme of any other author upon a closer examination therefore of the country wife it was thought proper to desert it entirely and to resort to moliere the original master whom wycherley copied the celebrated comedy of lecole de femmes appeared too thin of business consisting mostly in narrative to supply that deficiency the design occurred of making moliere himself supply the requisite materials and for this purpose letourdie and lecole de maris were called in as auxiliaries upon this idea the play was soon finished and it consists of characters situations and business from those three plays interwoven into one fable with as much skill as a little leisure in the summer time would permit with the professed design of condensing what appeared to be the best of three performances into one play it was deemed unnecessary to suppress any one scene of true nature merely because the author of high life below stairs and some other english writers might occasionally be tracked in the snow of moliere  the play when finished was given to miss elliot and it so happened that she had no opportunity of producing it till this season when in september last her bargain both for herself and the play was in agitation with mr beard the author of these sheets was astonished to hear that the country girl was actually in rehearsal at drury lane and that the parts had been given out in the summer nay as fast as they were written this it must not be dissembled looked like a design of forestalling the market especially as it was understood that miss elliot and the school for guardians had been offered the spring before to the manager of drury lane upon his own terms a remonstrance was immediately made to mr garrick purporting that he who had long been a manager of a successful theater was going to enter into a competition with a young actress for the profits of a play a meeting ensued where a gentleman of the first character for probity and genius was so obliging as to be the arbitrator mr garrick there protesting that he never heard of miss elliots play till within a few days it was thereupon determined that it was in that case an accidental clashing but that a design of forestalling would have been illiberal and unhandsome this last point of honor mr garrick seemed to learn upon this occasion  both parties were in consequence left to pursue their own interests and now the present writer will dismiss the school for guardians after saying that he composed it with the most disinterested principle and that if it prove in any degree conducive to the service of a young actress or the public entertainment he has all the reward he ever proposed to himself  n b an entire scene in the second act page  0 has been omitted since the first representation and would have been discarded from this edition but that the greatest part of the play was printed before it was acted  prologue spoken by miss elliot may i intrude upon your patience for a minute ladies and gentlemen before the opening of the play just to excuse an accident which i hope has no mischief in it i fain if you will permit a word or two would say i hope you will not be angry but we have got no prologue for to night and so i thought it was best to come and tell ye all the truth downright i went to mr poet and i spoke to him all i could but he said he had not leisure though i know it is in his power if he would a prologue maam says he  yes sir a prologue if you please and then i did so entreat the man and beg and pray and teaze i told him you know sir what a miserable plight we all are in to frown upon the performers when pit box and gallery begin whu  go the catcalls  dub  dub  dub  each dreadful criticks stick prolog  throw him over  will not ye ha some orange chips  prologue  cries of london  music all this and more i said but he determined still in formal fustian thus declared his will often have i tried seems puzzled  something about his style and how he felt the towns indulgent smile were i again to try my scanty vein i would beg protection for the feeble strain but then to sue  he paused and rubbed his head  to sue  when famed moliere the stage does tread were to profane the manes of the dead moliere of old and still with rapture seen was legislator of the comic scene to bid his simple girl assert the stage and if she pleases strive to mend the age this was my motive  this my only aim heedless of gain  no candidate for fame an audience will weigh all in equal scales for justice and not party there prevails thus spoke mrpoet and then with long steps marched away and now i am left alone to apologize for offering you this nights play well strive to make you laugh if our aim be not perverted pray how do you find yourselves  are ye in good humor and willing to be diverted if you approve the rostiad scribbler then no more i will dread who points his malice at a womans head who drop by drop his venom does distill while motherdullness guides the hirelings quill lulled in her lap strange wonders he descries and terence seems  a frenchman to his eyes from thence he issues soul decrees on plays adorns with scandal and lampoons with praise one smile from you defeats the slandrers aim his calumny like your applause is fame from your applause our mimic glories rise in pleasing you my whole ambition lies  epilogue spoken by miss elliot ladies your servant  servant gentlemen all  the same good

will not hear a word   brumpton i have done sir  you have proved it to demonstration by the same sort of logic that was used by one of the wits of charles the llds time to his dog when he was too lazy to beat him i wish you well married and settled in the country    sir theodore there again now dont enrage me i have some whimsical humors about me that let me tell you sir  and i can be very peremptory if i please  what when my neighbor strickland and i have agreed the matter  a young lady with a fair fortune in hand and seven hundred a year in expectancy as pretty a reversion as any in hampshire  and am i now to be told she does not suit my taste  she is not handsome and so i am to be wasting my breath with you about a complexion a nose and a lip    brumpton if you would but leave those matters to me sir    sir theodore but i tell you no i will not leave those matters to you  beauty is the last thing i desire to see in my family  your mother peace be to her was as ugly a woman as you shall see in a summers day and what do you think i married her for  for your good sir  for the good of my children    brumpton and pray sir which of ye does this sidebox face of mine take after   sir theodore you shall take nothing after me that you may depend upon unless you prove obedient to my will and pleasure  i will not leave you a foot of land    brumpton i hope you will live to enjoy it yourself sir    sir theodore i will give my fortune to found a new college where it is not wanted    brumpton i hope you will live to enjoy it yourself sir   sir theodore i will cut you off with a shilling to buy you an halter    brumpton i hope you will live to enjoy it yourself sir    sir theodore i hope i shall though you say it with a sort of a dry look between just and earnest  but dont talk to me of beauty again i never knew any good come of it beauty is like fine fruit only fit to draw a parcel of flies about it    brumpton and so i must set my teeth on edge with crabtree apples  but where would be the harm sir if purely for the good of my family i were to marry a lady of some share of beauty only just to cross the strain a little and settle a shape and a feature upon the issue of our marriage   sir theodore settle your wifes fortune upon em  look ye sir  my purse strings will never open  not a shilling of my money shall you touch till you pay your respects to miss strickland  now you know my resolution  what a graceless look there is ruin yourself if you will  follow your own courses sir    exit brumpton your most obedient very humble servant sir  you may depend that  i shall choose for myself  brisk why dont you answer sirrah  why brisk    enter brisk brumpton we have been pretty handsomely lectured here this morning brisk    brisk yes sir we have had wherewithal to edify by  i suppose we shall lie at tom tilburys at bagshot tonight sir    brumpton where   brisk tom tilburys sir  only just to break the neck of our journey for i suppose now you will drop all thoughts of this other lady  i forget her name  ay miss mary ann richley  she has no chance now i reckon sir    brumpton why you senseless numskull  as sure as i am charles brumpton esquire she shall be mrs brumpton and upon the death of my very good father she will be a baronets lady that is all    brisk and yet there is some truth in what sir theodore says  beauty is but a frail perishable sort of a commodity and if you are disinherited for it the ladys charms will not pay your poor servant brisk his boardwages a feature or a smile cannot go to market a pawnbroker will lend nothing upon the tip of an ear though indeed she may mortgage her person but that i take it will be for her own advantage we shall get nothing but a comely pair of horns by it sir with submission    brumpton why you talk a frothy kind of nothing at a tolerable rate brisk    brisk i have shown you one side of the medal now behold the reverse sir  when you marry an ugly woman there is no great pleasure in beholding her and to be sure when you look at her you will be apt to murmur to yourself  for all purposes of joy one may cut as desirable an object out of an old tapestryhanging  but then the woman has some valuable parchments such as leases bonds and mortgages and i sir shall live in tolerable plight with you which to so good a master    brumpton leave prating sirrah and do as i ordered you  put on your farmers dress go directly to the object i adore  let her know you are come from her guardian in the country and have his orders to take her home under your care  convey her safe to my arms and i shall reward you    brisk but sir    brumpton no arguing with me  about it straight    brisk you know how many blanketings and blows i have suffered in your service sir    brumpton sirrah no words  go and see who is at the door    brisk you have marred many an excellent plot of mine sir  you know you cannot help meddling when i undertake a scheme  if you will promise me sir not to    brumpton will you see who is at the door   brisk i am gone sir    exit brumpton ha ha  i shall most certainly carry her off  how sir theodore will be astonished when he finds she is an heiress  ha ha  it is the pleasantest adventure    enter belford belford brumpton good morrow  always in spirits i see   brumpton my dear belford nothing depresses my spirits  though you thought they were too high last night and were for letting me a little blood death man you make nothing of displaying an ell of swordblade in defense of your mistresss topknot   belford why you know i love too tenderly to bear the test of raillery  it is the infirmity of my temper why would you put me to it    brumpton and you that know my turn of mind why would you be angry with me  i am happily a follower of the laughing philosopher    belford po prithee man dont be such a coxcomb    brumpton prithee dont you be so morose so sour so discontented a spirit  but if in your phrase i am a coxcomb with all my heart in faith but take this along with you  what you mean as a term of reproach i receive as a compliment to the materials nature has been pleased to compound in this happy frame of mine    belford po po running on at the old rate  if selfapplause be philosophy you have a comfortable share   brumpton i have sir and while my happiness is preserved by it keep you the gravity and good sense that make you too refined to be pleased too wise to be merry and too knowing to be contented  i am in a fair way to be successful without any trouble at all  you are likely to be most scurvily disappointed after a world of pains  an humble bow which my dancing master taught me while i laughed at him a fashionable coat for which if my tailor is ever paid he will laugh at me  an intriguing snuff box  and an apt valet de chamber all these make love for me and    belford and you assume the merit of the conquest    brumpton oh yes when the trouble is over i take the reward  did you ever know a general officer who when the horse and the foot and the right and left wing have carried the day for him did not claim to himself both the honor and the booty but you make a toil of a pleasure  love which to me is a scene of delight to you is a drudgery your temper grows as sour as a prudes when the sermon is long and as hot as a welshmans if you laugh at his pedigree or a professed sharpers if you doubt his honor after he has cogged the dice and picked your pocket of your money   belford why i own i am piqued and naturally if any friend of mine out of mere spleen speak detractingly of the person i admire it were base infidelity in love not to defend her when she is disparaged  my every thought is dedicated to her  absent i see her hear her and my imagination gloats for ever on her charms   brumpton and you are so easily alarmed that little difficulties are the alps and pireneans in your way  now my faith in these matters removes mountains  but indeed in all things we are opposite characters  if a tradesman brings you in a bill and presses for payment sdeath does the scoundrel doubt my honor does he mean to affront me  now i when my father suffered me to be arrested went cheerfully into confinement and diverted myself for three weeks together with the bumbailiffs character  in the business of our softer passions the same humor pursues us  you write studied letters to your dulcinea i am written to  you sigh i sing  you fret i am gay  you upon a disappointment furies death and rage  there is no enduring this  life is grown a burden  damnation i burst into a laugh and what a whimsical world we live in  ha ha  but come i will hear your melancholy story  well the old dragon i suppose watches the hesperian fruit   belford he does sir  he keeps her locked up as a miler does his gold not to be made use of till his death and then to fall into hands that will not know the value of it  its loves last shift with me she is inaccessible and her guardian old lovibond proposes to marry her himself   brumpton and so like the tyrant of old intends to tack a living and dead body together   belford even so  my dear brumpton there should be an act of parliament to hinder these old fellows from stopping the propagation of the species   brumpton you are too hard upon em  they are seldom guilty of that mischief  i have known em have twins at a birth that is when some such coxcomb as myself gives them a helping hand  and then the old fellow cocks his hat upon it and totters about so vigorously wondering how the babes resemble him in every particular whilst the mother knows that she followed the example of the grecian painter and took a feature from every one of her acquaintance  if he prevents your marrying her take your revenge that way   belford profanation  her virtue sir  besides the world could never repair the loss  her heart i am sure is mine  i used to visit there  but now no admittance an evidence on the crown side in a messengers hands is not better secured   brompton now my business goes on without any trouble or difficulty my old dragon is in the country and has left his fair ward the sweetest girl my dear belford   belford you described her yesterday but few removes from a downright idiot   brumpton pardon me  she is simple indeed  but such a simplicity  it just serves to show that injustice has been done her in her education but in her every turn she gives such tokens of sensibility  she has beauty without knowing it  certain wild graces rather than accomplishments and talents instead of sense   belford po po  a mere rustic beauty   brumpton there now derogating from her merit and yet i am calm  the truth is she has been brought up in the country and wickedly kept in ignorance that she might fall an easy prey to her guardian  but i have raised a spirit in her   belford and how the devil did you gain access to her   brumpton i was going to tell you  old nestors out of town and has left her in the care of the two veriest simpletons that ever whistled for want of thought at a country fair  but gold sir gold that speaks all languages and adapts itself to all capacities has pleaded most eloquently for me  but come i positively must leave you   belford nay if it must be so    brumpton my dear belford cupid direct your arrows   i see her every day and all the day and every day is still but as the first so eager am i still to see her more  exeunt scene a street enter lovibond and oldcastle lovibond and but this moment returned mr oldcastle   oldcastle just this moment stepped out of the machine    lovibond well and now i suppose you have prudently laid aside all thoughts of matrimony   oldcastle ha you are a comical man brother lovibond  i have taken my measures tomorrow makes me a bridegroom and my fair ward miss mary ann a bride    lovibond and a little time will make you    oldcastle happy  though by that significant look you have your doubts   lovibond i have sir  i have a shrewd guess that    oldcastle then you will be out in your guess    lovibond i wish your horns ant out first    oldcastle well said and without any apprehension for yourself you are still determined to marry mary anns sister harriet i suppose   lovibond that is quite another business what i do is no rule for your actions    oldcastle it is as i ever said  each man is still looking at the hump upon his neighbors back but never thinks of casting an eye over his own shoulder  i warrant me now you in your grand climacteric will tell me i am old    lovibond full ten years before me in the race of life  besides you are an old bachelor  a stranger to the ways of wedlock  i am enured to the service  your sister mr oldcastle could have told you what a desperate good husband i was  but lack a day  you begin late  mercy on your forehead say i mercy on your forehead    oldcastle ha ha how blind some people are when they have taken a thing in their heads  ha ha   lovibond well well laugh on  but you that have been for ever a censor of your neighbors for ever fleering and jibing at the married life    oldcastle and a pleasant topic it is  why matrimony affords a little comedy in every family one knows  but the education i have given mary ann    lovibond is the worst in the world    oldcastle the very best  i have trained her up in plain simplicity  womans wit teems with contrivances to disgrace her husband  yet you would educate harriet in this profligate town    lovibond ay and i have taught her to know right from wrong    oldcastle right from wrong you have ruined the girl  have not you indulged her in every whimsy this fertile town affords   lovibond i have shown her the world    oldcastle have not you carried her to plays   lovibond to see folly ridiculed    oldcastle to profligate comedies   lovibond the stage is the school of virtue    oldcastle the school of sin and impudence   lovibond where vice undergoes the lash of satire    oldcastle where vice is made alluring provoking    lovibond where young ladies may learn    oldcastle the use of darkclosets backstairs and ladders of rope   lovibond where they may learn to put on the veil of modesty   oldcastle to put on the breeches and escape from their guardians    lovibond where they are taught to respect greyheaded authority   oldcastle to make a cuckold of authority  i know the ways of em all  their cards routs operas sohoassemblies all contrivances to excite curiosity kindle desire prompt inclination and send em all dancing a jig to destruction   lovibond commonplace invective  harriet will know how to avoid    oldcastle she will know how to deceive you    lovibond she will have too much honor    oldcastle she will have too much wit  now mary ann has no wild notions and of course no dangerous curiosity   lovibond her curiosity is to come  she will fall a prey to the first powdered coxcomb that bows to her    oldcastle her simplicity will preserve her    lovibond but when the serpents of this town begin to whisper in her ear    oldcastle they will have no opportunity  she is snug in a little box of an house which i have taken in the name of mr biddulph i have another lodging in my own name where i do business  nobody will see her and when the nine days wonder is over i shall pack off to the country and so escape from impertinence   lovibond well well  i cannot but laugh at your system of education ha ha  marry her if you will  and then on account of your age and infirmities you may do the business of your office by deputy  ha ha a plan of simplicity   oldcastle brother lovibond a good day to you  i wish you success  ha ha a towneducation for a young girl    exit lovibond alone ha ha poor man tottering to bed to a young wife  i will go home to my own harriet    enter belford belford sdeath and confusion my dull brain can devise nothing  hey is not that old argus centoculi with all his eyes out  mr lovibond  a sight of you  what have you been out of town   lovibond no the builders are carrying the town out of town i think and so a body need not move out of london for country air    belford how charmingly you look   lovibond what you call a green old age

principal  i have had the honor of knocking at your door several times    lovibond aside i know it    belford but no body at home    lovibond aside i know that too    belford i want to lose a little more money to you at backgammon    lovibond i have left it off    belford well well i will come and eat a bit of mutton with you  how stand you for today   lovibond what an hurry he is in aside i have

lovibond i have taken to breakfasting at the coffeehouse  one meets with very sensible people at the coffeehouse and hears men praised for being out of place and abused for being in place  and a huge deal of news that is very entertaining in the morning and all a damned lie in the evening  your servant    belford but the fair miss harriet  how does she do   lovibond there he has touched the right string at last aside i will let her know how kind you are  going belford nay dont fly so soon  i am to give you joy i hear  you are to make miss harriet happy i understand   lovibond oh no they talk

come  shall i dance at your wedding  you will trust her with me in a country dance and see that lovely bosom heave in sweet disorder and rise as if it wooed your hand to touch it ever it fails again    lovibond ha ha  you talk loosely    belford then when music wakens every gentler passion and the sprightly romping has called forth all her bloom then you will lead her off consenting trembling doubting blushing    lovibond ha ha ha   belford ha ha  come i will go and dine with you  the world must be peopled you know  ha ha ha   exeunt together laughing enter oldcastle oldcastle well well

brumpton my dear friend you are come in the very crisis of my fate in that dear extatic moment when to the natural vivacity of a gay giddy temper like mine ten thousand circumstances conspire to lift me to the upper regions of delight which together with the felicity of encountering the only man in the world that  i must take breath  i am faint with bliss  it is too much    oldcastle ay your fever is pretty high i see  recover your senses a little  and tell me at your leisure what is this mighty business    brumpton oh business of such a nature  the gods are now in council upon it  i expect mercury every moment in the shape of my man brisk to let me know that the nectared sweets that dwell upon the lips of a certain lady are intended for a wild unthinking coxcomb as the world is pleased to call me    oldcastle to be sure  you are in request among the ladies no doubt  now will he lie like an attorneys clerk aside you are going to help some worthy gentleman to an heir to his estate i warrant me    brumpton i have done some service in that way but the truth is i am now going to help my father to a grandson   oldcastle going to be married    brumpton this day may perhaps crown my joys  some certain fumblers at this end of the town who were a little alarmed at the proportions of this leg intend to light their windows upon it the court of aldermen are preparing all demonstrations of joy and their unhappy wives are going into deep mourning upon the occasion    oldcastle the same confident fop he ever was well and my friend sir theodore what says he to all this   brumpton you know his way the same old crabed humor  he has made a match for me elsewhere with one that  i would not deny the lady her merit  she preserves pickles well and is a very notable keeper of accounts  the woman will do very well of a long winters evening to say bless you when you sneeze  but    oldcastle she has a fortune i presume    brumpton does not want acres    oldcastle and you prefer one without any   brumpton you mistake me she is an heiress it is not clear that she is of age but as soon as she comes to years of discretion    oldcastle then she may play the fool as fast as she will    brumpton by choosing me you think she will give a specimen of her folly  ha ha i have passed many hours with her of late she is beautiful as an angel  now my dear sir you can do me the most essential service  you have great influence over sir theodore  i dare not break this matter to him myself but a word from you    oldcastle and has she really an estate   brumpton a very fine one  a large number of acres and a coalpit upon one of the manors    oldcastle i profess i like your taste  ha ha the coalpit whitens her skin and she may hereafter wear a few of her own acres in each ear  i will see my old friend about this and will positively promote your welfare  he shall agreee to it and  but how did you bring this about pray   brumpton an old way that i have  i came saw and conquered  i saw her at her window  such blooming sweetness her eyes were through my heart at once  love inspired me with due courage    oldcastle that was right  a bold stroke for a wife    brumpton i drank tea with her the very next evening  i must indeed admit that her understanding is not the most accomplished    oldcastle so best  never marry a wit    brumpton she is at present rather in a state of ignorance but from those blue eyes she occasionally darts such glances as bespeak a mind susceptible of the highest refinement   oldcastle where does she live   brumpton in the very next street    oldcastle what that street there   brumpton yes that  under the care of the verriest muckworm    oldcastle he means me i fear aside and her name pray    brumpton miss mary ann richley

against him  while you was out he came again under my window   lovibond ay   harriet i ran away at the sight of him  but the window being open he flung this little box into the room with a letter in it   lovibond a letter in it    harriet yes the wicked contriver a letter in it  i ran to the window to throw it to him again but he was gone and then it occurred to me that it might not be quite so prudent to throw it into the street lest it should fall into the hands of malicious people who might misinterpret appearances to my disadvantage   lovibond that was wisely judged    harriet i have been ever since thinking that it ought to be returned and if i had a proper person    lovibond who so proper as myself let me have it   harriet no  no  it would affront him more if delivered by a common porter   lovibond excuse me i am the fittest person  a letter in a box  what contrivances they have  i will take care he shall have it and he will look so silly when he perceives all his schemes are blasted   harriet why indeed it will astonish him the more if you deliver it    lovibond so it will  ha ha  it will be a rare stroke of revenge  ha ha   harriet she laughs the newest that

  lovibond there is something in that  your wisdom charms me  you endear yourself to me more and more every hour    harriet you will use your own discretion whether to open it or not  but the reasons i have given    lovibond are to me conclusive  i will about this business directly  ha ha well put the greatest affront in the world upon him  ha ha the truest mark of contempt ha ha goodby rosebud
