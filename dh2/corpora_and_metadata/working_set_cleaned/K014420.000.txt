the welsh heiress a comedy  london printed for richard white no     piccadilly        to the earl of harcourt as i have attempted to write a comedy at the flattering instigation of your lordship the following scenes have a natural claim to your protection if when you prompted and encouraged me to court the comic muse you had imparted to me at the same time some share of your instinctive penetration into character  of your elegant but impressive ridicule of fashionable levities  had you consigned to my hand the clue that guides you in the chase and detection of folly through the intricate windings of her labyrinth i should have presented to you a comedy more worthy of your attention such as it is it offers me an opportunity of publicly acknowledging the high value i set upon a friendship which i have had the happiness of enjoying so many years  i have the honor to be your most obedient humble servant edward jerningham  prologue to the welsh heiress written by john tailor esquire spoken by mr barrymore shoot folly as it flies such is the game at which it is said the comic muse should aim the darker passions that the heart deform and spread over groaning states the moral storm are pompous themes the sportive maid resigns to swell her solemn sisters lofty lines yet when she fain would strike such towering prey the serious damsel takes the safest way though proud yet prudent  wounding guilt too high to wake in you the selfreproaching sigh in sluggish apathy you careless sit nor smart for crimes that you could never commit but in the comic province who shall dare to touch the faults that you may happily share for conscience then may strengthen the appeal and bid you crush what forces her to feel for virtue zealous and disdaining awe even feared by those too mighty for the law the stage through every station vice has tried and honest satire has her lash applied hence while the comic muse must fear to wound she still is doomed to course over beaten ground again bring forward what too well you know or if a novelty some monster show tonight our bard who long has struck the lyre a modest minstrel of the plaintive choir attempts for once a harmless laugh to raise more dreading censure than presuming praise one point we fairly in his cause may plead  for know he dares to touch the scribbling breed dares strip from dull conceit its bold pretense and prove an author may be void of sense then let your candor countenance the grace that freely owns the follies of his race and sure our bard even malice need not fear could malice lurk in specious ambush here even she may yield her pittance of applause to him whose venurous pen a brother draws for while thus sportive on a scribbling elf our simple poet may deride himself  the following lines written by the rev mr pritchard jun before he knew the author was in possession of another prologue contain too much merit to be suppressed there lived at argos once a youth of fame so horace tells and lycas was his name who if there is a joy which mad men know and such as madness only can bestow by the strong force of its prevailing power waked to fresh transport every newborn hour each visionary scene that fancy drew his mind embodied and confirmed it true often in the height of his distempers rage he saw or fancied that he saw a stage where as he heard the selfimagind sound and trod or thought he trod dramatic ground where with nice skill in imitative art each son of thespis seemed to play his part the fond conceit drew down his loud applause as though reality had been the cause and every member head hands lips and eyes professed their praise and testified surprise if such the charm where fancy gave delight let truth not fiction plead our cause tonight and as i come to take a nearer view pleading for him who strives to pleasure you oh may propitious beauty to the boxes smile reward may science to the pit favor and the gods to the galleries regard sons of renown the bards of ancient days wore on their heads a circling crown of bays these bloom eternal for to them belong the grace the pride the energies of song the tale welltold the animated line the glow of sentiment and thought divine yet still there blossoms many a virgin flower on the fair spot where genius rears her bower of these our bard presents before your view one of a simple but unsullied hue

bannister jun mr fancy mr r palmer lady bellair miss farren lady plinlimmon miss pope miss plinlimmon mrs jordan scene  melcourthall near town  the welsh heiress a comedy act i enter lady bellair  mr fashion mr fashion i am happy at your ladyships arrival we expected you last night   lady bellair i purposely avoided coming last night that i might not be complicated in the embarrassment of the welsh familys arrival whom i understand came yesterday what sort of creatures are they how many did the caravan consist of i expect to see the whole race of shenkin   mr fash do not be alarmed as to their number i will give your ladyship a list of the dramatis personae and a faint sketch of their characters   lady b pray do for i have seen nobody not even my brother the padrone della casa   mr fash lord melcourt i know is walked out i was just enquiring after him but to return to the subject  yesterday evening the family coach covered with dust and much damaged by the toil and length of the journey waddled up to the halldoor in great labor and was happily delivered of sir pepper plinlimmon lady plinlimmon miss plinlimmon and a femme de chamber two servants attended on welsh ponies the coach i must inform you contained originally five persons but it miscarried on the road of mr taffey their chaplain who could not bear the inside of a carriage he is however expected tomorrow in the basket of some stagecoach   lady b i fancy we shall be able to do without mr taffey   mr fash indeed you are mistaken he is one of the essential personages in our drama for he is to join the hands of lord melcourt and miss plinlimmon   lady b what sort of a thing is the girl   mr fash she is very well as to beauty her shape elegantly and harmoniously formed but when in motion ungraceful her mind is a compound of ignorance and information like the waving branches that give a checquered kind of light she made us laugh last night at supper with the childish simplicity of her questions and sometimes she excited our admiration at the quickness of her repartee and the solidity of her judgment in a word she appears to be an inspired idiot   lady b now let me have the portrait of sir pepper   mr fash sir pepper is a plain unassuming man subject at times to a warmth of temper and whose local train of impoverished ideas are quite unsuitable to the scene he is now entering upon and to the company with which he is now to assosociate his mind has received a peculiar biass respecting the prophecies that have been floating of late and he is almost convinced the world will be at an end before his daughter has brought lord melcourt a son and heir   lady b i confess i like the whimsicallity of that notion it will serve to amuse us   mr fash as for lady plinlimmon she has a considerable share of vanity half of which she spends in admiration of her daughterinlaw the other she consumes upon herself she imagines she has a refined taste for literature that she is a supreme judge of painting and    lady b oh then she is intolerable   mr fash by no means there is a broad good humor about her which makes her inoffensive she looks with impatience for the honor of cementing an acquaintance with your ladyship   lady b i think from your description it will not be unentertaining to pass a day or two with these welsh emigrants but does my brother seem happy at his approaching nuptials   mr fash yesterday he seemed at first overcome by the invasion of these vandals but his native mirth rallied and at the close of the evening he was himself again but here he comes   enter lord melcourt lord mel sister you are welcome you look in high beauty the elegant circles in town will be eclipsed without you have you seen our new kindred   lady b not yet mr fashion has been giving me a slight sketch of them   lord mel well i am ready to consign sir pepper and lady plinlimmon to the full discharge of your raillery but spare i entreat you my shepherdess of the alps   lady b never fear never fear   lord mel lady plinlimmon looks for your arrival with all the flutter of anxious expectation your fame like an artful prologue has smoothed the way to a kind reception she talks of you as the paragon of excellence she will study your whole person observe every motion attitude and every article of your dress   mr fash lady bellair may be said to be a capital picture from the gallery of fashion for lady plinlimmon to copy   lady b i will venture to say without the impeachment of vanity that the copy will not come up to the merit of the original   mr fash your ladyship is perfectly right   lady b but tell me brother dont you feel independent of the charms of your young bride an uncommon elasticity of mind in the removal of the encumbrances which this marriage will effect   lord mel yes upon that ground i plant the standard of my gaudiest streamer i have had a private conference with sir pepper and his immediate relinquishing of his brecknockshire estate will enable me to part with my irish acres and satisfy all my noisy claimants who like a voracious pack of hounds have chaced me from hill to dale and notwithstanding the windings of excuses and the intricate mazes of delay would have soon overtaken me had not this golden shower from the welsh mountains put an end to the chase   lady b bravo are we to expect any more company   lord mel i have invited my friend fancy the miniaturepainter i expect also phrensy the poet whom you have often heard me talk of he will suit lady plinlimmon and their mutual eccentricities will divert us   mr fash i am glad that oddity will be added to the group you have frequently amused me with anecdotes concerning him when will he be here   lord mel i expect him every minute he writes word he will be here today but begs his coming may be a secret and as he is not personnally known to any body but myself he desires to assume the name of tombstone   mr fash what a whim what can he mean   lord m most likely he is afraid of his creditors  however do not betray him to the rest of our society but here come our welsh relatives  enter sir pepper plinlimmon lady plinlimmon and miss plinlimmon give me leave to present lady bellair to your ladyship   lady plin independent of the connection that is taking place between our families i rejoice at the opportunity that now offers of commencing an acquaintance with lady bellair   lady b your ladyship does me a great deal of honor i hope sir pepper you will like this part of the world sufficiently to engage you to stay among us some time   lady plin what ease what elegance  aside sir p plin i should wish to enjoy your ladyships society but i am rather disposed to return as soon as i can for if as nostradamus says we are in the fifth act i should like to be at home when the curtain drops   lady plin dear sir pepper do not cloud the splendor of lady bellairs mind with the dark mists of your odious prophecies   lady b i beg your ladyship will let sir pepper say what he chooses i am not easily alarmed credulity is not my foible but this is a conversation of too severe a cast for our young bride you my dear may send your expecting eye through a long and gay perspective   miss p so i do i expect to have fine clothes to go to a great many balls and i expect to be married   sir p plin your ladyship will exuse the wild simplicity of my daughter   lady b oh i am a great admirer of artless simplicity it is as rare to be met with as sincerity   lady plin when she has exchanged the rude breezes of the mountain where she was bred for the gentler gales of polished society she will assimilate with the soft elegance of her new situation   mr fash lady bellair herself could not have invented a metaphor more happily allusive   sir p plin my wife is very metaphorical   miss plin yes we all have our different calls mamma is metaphorical  papa is prophetical  i am comicall  the old curate near plinlimmon castle is classical and his wife is dropsicall   lady plin you must check this careless volubility   lord mel suppose gentlemen we leave the ladies to confer by themselves will you allow me sir pepper to show you the vandyke i mentioned last night   sir p plin if you please   exeunt sir pepper mr fashion lord melcourt lady plin i should wish your ladyship not to be impressed with an idea that my daughterinlaw is deficient in the great outline of education though she has not yet received the last touchings of embellishment i myself have been her tutoress and have read to her several of the best english authors   miss plin and all the welsh poets   lady b i am persuaded miss plinlimmon is deficient in nothing that is absolutely requisite for the station she is going to ascend as for those delicate finishings that fashionable elegance demands    lady plin your ladyships society will supply i consign this young alpine plant to your care it is yours to give the pliant branches their proper direction and to breathe on them a playful air of easy negligence with your permission i will now withdraw for the purpose of my girls imbibing from your ladyship those nameless graces you only can bestow   exit lady plinlimmon miss plin what are those things mamma says you are to bestow upon me   lady b my friendship and you in return must have some friendship for me and speak to me with confidence upon every point that relates to your marriage with my brother by what he has said to me i find he is extremely attached to you i hope his attachment will meet with an equal return on your part   miss plin that is as it may be   lady b i am sure lord melcourt is reckoned by all the ladies very handsome amiable entertaining and    miss plin i know all that and i should be very partial to him if    lady b if what my dear   miss plin if    lady b has he done any thing to offend you   miss plin no but he has done nothing to please me   lady b does he appear to neglect you i recollect he was uncommonly assiduous in writing to you last winter   miss plin oh yes he frequently wrote to me and he used to say in his letters that when i should come to melcourt hall we should wander through the groves together and he would say such tender things to me by the riverside now we were by the riverside yesterday evening and scarce one word did he say to me but conversed with my papa about the winding of his river egad i wish it was wound round his neck   lady b fie child you must not imagine that lord melcourts attention is to be totally devoted to you   miss plin am i then not to expect any share of his conversation is there to be no time for wooing no flirtation no whispering no toying no innocent anticipation   lady b miss plinlimmon the manufacturing of love in wales may perhaps be as coarse as a sackcloth but in this part of the world the cupids of fashion weave the fine texture with a light and invisible hand   miss plin invisible indeed but if i am never to partake of his company what am i come here for what shall i be the better for being married to him where is the advantage   lady b you will obtain the advantage of his name and title you will move in a higher sphere   miss plin but i always understood that wedlock was a kind of traveling through life together   lady b so it is but then it is like traveling in the double stagecoach you go the same journey together without seeing or incommoding one another   miss plin i hate the double stagecoach i like a visavis much better however if lord melcourt does not become more assiduous he may be supplanted  fashion is much more attentive   enter lord melcourt lord mel i ask pardon for interrupting you but the odd character i spoke of is arrived he begs to see me in private he is now coming   lady b we will retire immediately   exeunt lady bellair and miss plinlimmon enter servant  announces mr tombstone  enter mr phrensy mr phrensy your servant  i am obliged to you for your invitation  i have an epithalamium for the occasion shall i read it   lord mel all in good time tell me first why you assume another name   mr phrensy you shall hear but do not betray me   lord mel you may rely upon me   mr phrensy shall not i read the epithalamium first   lord mel no no i am impatient for your history   mr phrensy well you shall hear it  but i am certain you will be pleased with the epithalamium   lord mel i have no doubt but let me know the secret motive of your changing your name before we are interrupted   mr phrensy do you think your servants will know me   lord mel i have an entire new set   mr phrensy that makes me happy   lord mel was it the fear of your creditors   mr phrensy no such terrestrial motive urged me to assume another name this liberty i have taken with myself flows from a more sublime cause than the apprehension of bailiffs i will now disclose the mystery  unless you choose to hear the epithalamium first    lord mel do not trifle any longer but let me know the purport of this mysterious conduct   mr phrensy envy which attends living authors has pursued me with great implacability   lord mel i do not recollect that i ever heard your works censured   mr phrensy likely enough  censure would have excited notice  notice would have led to observation  observation to justice  justice to admiration  no no envy my lord took another method with me she some how or other contrived to breathe over me and my works a dread repose the warehouse where my productions are deposited resembles a family vault where all my numerous progeny are at rest and are only distinguished from one another by labels  such as phrensys comedies  phrensys tragedies  phrensys satires  phrensys    lord mel but what has all this to do with the changing of your name   mr phrensy i am now coming to the mark my friends have soothed me with the idea that posterity will do me justice  that posterity will say to these sleepers arise then will my comedies my tragedies my odes shake off their dust and dazzle the admiring world   lord mel what is all this to the purpose   mr phrensy you shall hear  instead of patiently waiting the natural process of time i conceived a stratagem of anticipating my triumphs and of taking a short cut to posterity   lord mel how do you mean  by cutting your throat   mr phrensy it is done it is done    lord mel what is done   mr phrensy i have killed myself that is to say i have given out that i am dead this is the reason for changing my name  envy was never played such a trick before    lord mel but why take the melancholy name of tombstone   mr phrensy that is to keep me in recollection that i am dead   lord mel there is sense in that   mr phrensy but this stratagem my lord has not yet answered my sanguine expectation   lord mel how so   mr phrensy i have been three weeks dead and would you believe that there has not been in any of the papers an elegy a posthumous puff or a line in my commendation   lord mel that is very strange   mr phrensy egad a tallowchandler might have slipped out of the world as easily as i have done   lord mel how did you insert your death in the papers for it escaped my notice   mr phrensy simply thus  yesterday died universally lamented the eminent poet classical phrensy esquire   lord mel to be sure nothing could be more simple and modest  but i have an idea that i think will serve your scheme better  i will have it inserted in the papers and you shall draw up the paragraph to this purpose  yesterday the eminent poet classical phrensy esquire died suddenly at melcourthall where he was upon a visit to his friend lord melcourt   mr phrensy very good  excellent conception   lord mel the circumstance of making your exit at my country house during the interesting moment of my nuptials will give your death an eclat   mr phrensy this second edition of my death with additions will do admirably faith but what will your company say when they shall read the paragraph   lord mel i shall take particular care that none of them shall see it   mr phrensy but what does your lordship smile at   lord mel another idea occurs which will serve to enrich the paragraph    mr phrensy as how   lord mel fancy the miniaturepainter will be here to day  i shall tell him as a profound secret that you lie dead in the house and that it is unknown to the company  and i will beg of him as you are my friend to take a faint sketch of you    mr phrensy this will as your lordship says enrich the paragraph which may run thus  mr phrensy being the intimate friend of lord melcourt an eminent painter from town was sent for to take a likeness of the great poet   lord mel admirable you have only to whiten your face and make yourself like a ghost in an opera the painter shall only peep at you and then finish the sketch from memory  trust to my contrivance you shall not be detected   mr phrensy i will go and prepare the paragraph phrensy going returns your lordship then does not wish to hear the epithalamium first   lord mel no no i expect the painter every minute  exit mr phrensy self conceit  good humor  with absurdity are happily blended in that mans composition   enter servant servant mr fancy is arrived    lord mel bid him come in    enter mr fancy mr fancy i wish your lordship joy i flatter myself you have not sent for me to be an idle spectator  i hope i shall have the honor of drawing the bride   lord mel most assuredly  the art suffers when you are idle   mr fancy have you assembled many of your friends upon this occasion   lord mel no  lady bellair is come and mr fashion and a literary acquaintance of mine mr tombstone   mr fancy i never heard of his name   lord mel he has lived a great deal abroad he is lately returned from africa i had another ingenious man here and he was my particular friend but a sudden death has deprived me of that invaluable person what i am going to relate is a secret nobody is acquainted with the terrible accident except a confidential servant poor phrensy the poet died suddenly last night he is now in the house and is to be removed this evening i should be happy to have a resemblance of my old friend and if you would have the goodness to take a hasty sketch of him you would infinitely oblige me   mr fancy i can have no objection   lord mel let all this transaction be as secret as the grave   mr fancy you may depend upon me   enter mr phrensy with a paper mr phrensy here is the paragraph for your inspection   lord mel taking the paper i shall look at it another time let me have the satisfaction of introducing two gentlemen to one another who are formed for each others acquaintance mr tombstone let me present you to mr fancy i must now beg permission to leave you together i shall return in a few moments   exit lord melcourt mr fancy i am happy in commencing an acquaintance with so ingenious a gentleman i should be proud to draw your portrait   mr phrensy smiling you shall mr fancy i suppose the bride is to be embellished by your pencil   mr fancy of course but lord melcourt did not send for me merely to paint the young lady   mr phrensy your pencil will undoubtedly run through the whole family   mr fancy likely enough but i have another meaning i am sent for  i am sure mr tombstone may be trusted and as the first fruits of my friendship for you i will deposit in your breast a profound secret   mr phrensy i will in return communicate to you the first secret that is whispered in my ear   mr fancy i have then to inform you that there is a person lies dead in the house and lord melcourt has begged i would just catch a resemblance of his departed friend   mr phrensy who is it   mr fancy phrensy the poet   mr phrensy indeed is that great and unrivalled man no more   mr fancy you are too magnificent in the epithets you apply to mr phrensy   mr phrensy by no means reflect what an awful task is now imposed upon you methinks i see you advance with sublime emotion toward the honored couch that bears the breathless image of that immortal man   mr fancy but whence this enthusiasm after all it must be confessed that the friendship of lord melcourt was the highest feather in his cap   mr phrensy talk not to me of feather or of cap his head was encircled with laurel wove by the public hand for shame mr fancy is it thus you revere the illustrious dead   mr fancy dont be so warm mr tombstone i am perhaps a little ungenerous in speaking against the dead who cannot defend themselves but tell me dispassionately do you admire poor phrensys writings   mr phrensy i do i know them by heart have you a mind to hear the sixteenth scene of his tragicomedy in six acts where the princess catches her    mr fancy no no i will not give you the trouble of repeating your friends verses   mr phrensy my friends verses you say right yes my intimate friend he never wrote a line without consulting me   mr fancy but if he was so dear a friend how comes it you are not more affected by his death   mr phrensy i am astonished stunned bewildered at the dreadful secret you disclosed when the first impression is subsided grief will succeed lord melcourt out of affection for me secreted the melancholy event but i begin to feel myself overpowered  goes aside with his handkerchief to his eyes enter lord melcourt lord mel what is the matter with mr tombstone   mr fancy inadvertantly i informed him of the death of mr phrensy not knowing the intimacy that subsisted between them   lord mel how could you be so imprudent goes up to mr phrensy dear tombstone do not yield to this inordinate affliction   mr phrensy how can i command my grief  throws his arms round lord melcourts neck lord mel i take no inconsiderable share in your distress   mr phrensy undoubtedly you do in loosing mr phrensy you lose your panegyrist  think how often he has regaled your lordship with the thickest cream of dedication   lord mel forbear to remind me you affect me too much   mr fancy what a situation i am in i thought i was invited to the abode of festivity instead of which i am come into the house of mourning i had better return to town   lord mel by no means when this mutual sympathetic emotion is over we shall return to our former mirth   mr fancy your lordship appeared very easy and jocund just now   lord mel you then saw me during the intervals of the first and second paroxism of grief   mr fancy is then your lordships affliction methodised into acts like a play with pauses between the divisions   lord mel indeed mr fancy this is not a moment for raillery let me entreat you to leave us we shall be more composed presently   mr fancy well i will obey your commands   exit lord melcourt and mr phrensy burst into laughing lord mel we shall have still more entertainment with the painter when he has drawn your picture   mr phrensy i am impatient for that scene i will go and prepare myself   lord mel my valet de chamber who has my instructions and who is in our confidence will assist and furnish you with whatever is necessary for the purpose i must now join the company   end of the first act act ii lord melcourt  mr fancy with a pallet in his hand  a couch at some distance on which mr phrensy lies disguised as dead lord mel shall we now approach the venerable remains of the great man   mr fancy give me leave to mingle my colors a little   lord mel i am afraid the task i have imposed upon you is unpleasant you feel i make no doubt very disagreeable sensations upon this occasion   mr fancy not in the least a lifeless frame does not impress me with any disturbance i drew lady fidgets dead monkey the other day without any kind of perturbation   lord mel but mr fancy do you make no distinction between lady fidgets dead monkey and the remains of my friend   mr fancy as he was your friend i respect him but does your lordship really think he is worthy of those encomiums that you and mr tombstone so profusely bestowed upon him   lord mel my partiality may perhaps cast a little suffusion over my judgment but tell me do you not venerate his memory do you not admire his works   mr fancy perhaps as much as your lordship it is impossible with so refined an understanding as yours to receive any entertainment from his writings the characters in his plays for example may be compared to the incongruities that we meet with on signposts things that never existed in nature such as blue boars black swans dragons and mermaids  i never felt a more pleasing invitation to a slumber than i did at his last comedy which unfortunately i did not enjoy long for i was roused by a thousand catcalls    mr phrensy starts up from the couch mr phrensy it is false it is false no catcall was heard at my comedy though i am dead i am not damned    mr fancy recovering from his fright i perceive it was a trick   mr phrensy trick or no trick my works will live when the memory of lady fidget her monkey and yourself will be swept from the face of the earth  base calumniator    lord mel i beg i may be the negociator of peace between the living and the dead in the first place i can assure mr fancy no indignity was meant to him  mr phrensy for particular reasons having given out that he was dead i thought a portrait of the author by a celebrated painter would add luster to the posthumous edition of his works   mr fancy the i forgive him  runs to embrace him mr phrensy but tell me first how can i forgive the scurrilous observations you so liberally bestowed upon my compositions   lord mel dear phrensy you do not imagine that the painter was in earnest  flatter him a little  aside to fancy mr fancy i hope i am not so destitute of taste so far from sleeping at your comedy i disturbed the boxes with my peals of laughter   mr phrensy give me your hand   mr fancy then the parts were so chequered with sentimental and pathetic passages   mr phrensy excuse me there was nothing pathetic in my comedy nor any thing like sentiment   mr fancy i only mean in the winding up of your comedy where the butchers daughter kneels   mr phrensy my dear sir you are speaking of my tragedy   lord mel phrensy you must excuse him  fancys mind has not yet recovered from the confusion your sudden bursting from the dead occasioned you had better retire and relapse into tombstone   mr phrensy i will follow your direction  and as you mr fancy are acquainted with my secret history  let us for the future be friends   exit mr phrensy mr fancy now we are alone  i must declare you was rather too hard upon me in exposing me as you did to the indignation of the enraged poet    lord mel i only intended a little innocent sport i did not think he would have rushed upon us so rudely it was his irritability in hearing himself abused that made him rise from the dead   mr fancy then it was my own doing for the abuse was all mine i must now prepare to draw the living the ladies i believe are now waiting for me   lord mel i will follow you    exit mr fancy enter mr fashion lord mel i wish fashion you had been here sometime ago  we had an excellent scene between the painter and the dead poet  the painter was almost in an hysteric   mr fashion i think these two characters will afford us still more entertainment   lord mel i hope so  for i want something to draw off my attention and to prevent me from fixing too steady an eye upon this bride of mine i shall be ashamed to introduce her among my acquaintance next winter   mr fash do not be under any apprehension the instructions of lady bellair mrs townlife and lady angelica worthless will refine the rude simplicity of your wild mountaingirl   lord mel though i have a high opinion of those able modern professors i am inclined to think this welsh girl will baffle all their skill she will never through them as through filtering stones divest herself of the heterogeneous matter the heavy particles the nauseous lees she has imbibed from her country education from the manners of sir pepper and from the vulgarity of the motherinlaw  no no it is impossible    mr fash i ask your pardon  when she has been decanted off into polished society she will leave the dregs behind   lord mel i wish it may be so  i must now look for the painter who is going to draw the portrait of my bride elect   mr fash i will not detain you   exeunt scene  the saloon lady plinlimmon miss plinlimmon lady plin i beg you will put on your best looks and sit patiently to the painter that lord melcourt may have a good resemblance of you   miss plin what does he want my picture for will he not see me morning noon and night it is not likely he should forget my face or is it to hang me in effigy in case i should run away from him   lady plin it is usual for the bride to present her portrait to the bridegroom so i beg you will make no difficulty about it   enter lord melcourt and mr fancy mr fancy i hope i do not intrude upon your ladyship   lady plin by no means   mr fancy this is the hour your ladyship appointed and i confess i am impatient to commence the flattering task but to do justice to the charms of that young lady no pencil can have the presumption   miss plin the painter i find mamma says finer things than the lover   lord mel it is part of his profession to talk the language of bombast and inordinate adulation it becomes my situation to show respect a delicate reserve a genuine but not an importunate attachment a calm not a tempestuous solicitude in one word a silent adoration   miss plin silent enough egad i believe your adoration has a lock jaw   lady plin fie child dont talk so ridiculously pray mr fancy in what costume shall my daughter be drawn   mr fancy perhaps miss plinlimmon will point out herself what character she prefers   miss plin i hope mr fancy will give my face a good character for it has done no harm   mr fancy i ask your pardon it has done a great deal of harm but if my opinion was consulted i should recommend to miss plinlimmon to be painted in the attitude of reading   miss plin i should like to be drawn reading for i know i have a pretty downcast look   lady plin i must not forget to inform you that all the females of the plinlimmons have had a family mole a little above the left eye for these two centuries now isabellas is too complicated with the eyebrow perchance you can make some slight alteration   mr fancy by the omnipotence of the pencil we can raise the beauty spot and place it in view   lord mel but is not that departing from reality is it not a deceit a kind of pencil lie   mr fancy it is only changing the local resemblance it is at the worst a skilful and elegant inaccuracy the beautyspot is there i make no addition to what nature has already done i only bring to the eye of admiration what her ladyship informs me nature has rather removed from the sight   lady plin i declare mr fancy you defend yourself most ingeniously does he not my lord   lord mel most skilfully indeed   mr fancy i have taken a much greater license than this without feeling any reproach of conscience for example when i had the honor of drawing lady frizlerump i broke the immeasurable length of her bald buff forehead by introducing two moles and a patch the patch you know is a thing ad libitum and as i knew lady frizlerump had a mole on each shoulder i removed them from their native spot they were well worth the carriage and i placed them in a more conspicuous situation there is no great deceit in this it is only a kind of transplanting which ought to be as allowable in painting as in gardening   lord mel well ladies you perceive how sportfully mr fancy discourses he has a mind to give you a specimen of his manner of entertaining his company when they are sitting to him   lady plin but i think before we come to any determination about the dress it would be proper to consult the attic taste of lady bellair   mr fancy most assuredly you may show her these miniatures which i have lately finished this is the portrait of miss harelip gives the miniatures which attracted the public eye the last exhibition this is only a profile of miss woolsack the judges daughter   lady plin i will not detain you any longer at present   m fancy i will wait upon your ladyship whenever you will favor me with your commands   exit mr fancy miss plin but why does your lordship with so much to have my picture since i am to live with you do you want me duplicated dont you think one miss plinlimmon will be enough for you   lord melcourt the mutual exchange of pictures is one of the etiquettes of modern marriages   lady plin marriage itself may be said to be a mutual exchange of attention indulgence and affection   miss plin in this mutual exchange pray my lord inform me which of us two will be the gainer   lord mel if there is any calculation to be made i am undoubtedly the gainer   miss plin give me leave to calculate my losses in marrying your lordship i lose my name  i lose the society of papa and mamma  i shall perhaps lose my shape  and perhaps in time lose my reputation   lady plin peace to that flippant tongue of yours you are trying his lordships patience before the time a i must carry these miniatures to lady bellair your lordship will excuse my leaving you  isabella go to your papa    exeunt lady plinlimmon and miss plinlimmon lord mel heaven and earth what a family am i going to be connected with but i must not pause upon that thought it would almost lead me to distraction   exit lord melcourt scene  lady bellairs apartment lady bellair  lady plinlimmon lady bell here is a miniature of myself which was drawn when i was married i think the dress would suit miss plinlimmon   lady plin taking the miniature it is beautiful nor could it be otherwise while it presumed to have any resemblance of your ladyship  but you just now mentioned your marriage i know that you and lord bellair were separated not long after interested as i am in whatever relates to your ladyship do not imagine it is mere curiosity that solicits some illustration upon that point   lady bell i am ready to give you every information and the more so as ill nature that monotonous and dull commentator may have construed our separation in her invariable manner   lady plin i am all attention   lady bell lord bellair somewhat advanced in years palled and satiated with the pleasures of the town began to medicate a retreat but before he retired into the country from which he was never to return he ranged through all the gay scenes of public resort to find a youthful associate to accompany him in his retirement   lady plin your mysterious history begins to unfold itself the beauteous flower that flourished in the bright sunshine of admiration grew pale and cheerless when it was transplanted to the solitary gloom of the country   lady b i must confess your ladyships extemporary apologue comprises my little story and makes my continuation unnecessary   lady plin not at all  i beg you will continue your interesting narrative   lady b lord bellair amidst the innumerable beauties that at once attracted and bewildered his choice threw at length his selecting glance upon me   lady plin his choice did honor to his taste   lady b it did not however contribute to his happiness  the single voice of my reluctance was lost in the chorus of approbation that resounded from all my relations and friends  i then summoned all the fortitude i was capable of and took a courageous leave of the town  adieu i cried to the flattery of men  to the pleasing envy of the women  adieu to balls  adieu to the delight of charioteering in a phaeton through st jamess street every morning  adieu to the easy instructions of the town to the contemplation of manners in caracatureshops to the reading of shakespeare upon canvass and to the study of the english history upon walls  the fatal hour arrived  the carriage was at the door    lady plin you really excite my compassion what ensued when you reached the ancient family seat   lady b say rather the family vault  i wrapped myself up in my resignation as in a winding sheet and thought to have buried myself in a husband  the fates decreed otherwise i broke forth from the ponderous marble beneath which i was quietly inurned and am come again to reside among the living   lady plin the world is a considerable gainer be enjoying you once more fortunate was the storm that blew such a flower upon the lap of society but whence arose that storm did it arise from lord bellairs illtemper however i am not curious indeed i can partly guess the solitude of the country faintly checquered by the visits of the apothecary and the vicars wife his lordships fulsome fondness  his odious approaches    lady b my dear lady plinlimmon you are going on so rapidly it is of no use to reckon the slight imperceptible threads of discontent which grew at length into a cable behold me restored to independence sufficiently affluent and almost as happy as a widow   lady plin may nothing interrupt the happiness you possess and which you deserve before i had the honor of your acquaintance i heard your merits highly extolled   lady b i am exceedingly obliged to those persons who have smoothed my path to your ladyships partiality but to whom am i indebted   lady plin the persons i allude to are friends of your ladyship and are neighbors of ours in wales they were in town last winter i mean mrs vandal and her sister   lady b yes i recollect those old tapestry figures but you must not imagine there was any intimacy between us i endured them at my toilet they may be reckoned if you please among my morning friends but you may be sure i never acknowledged the creatures in an evening   lady plin that is charming i shall acquire under your auspices the fashionable discriminations the morning and evening friend is a happy distinction but i fear i am trespassing upon your time  offering to go lady b i will wait upon you immediately with your permission i will send to the company to assemble in your bookroom where we will fix upon the plan of this evenings amusement   exit lady plinlimmon scene  bookroom enter lord melcourt  mr phrensy lord mel we will wait till lady plinlimmon comes as she wishes extremely to commence a literary acquaintance with you   mr phrensy she is comely faith i do not dislike her person   lord mel she is the rubens style   mr phrensy i hear her coming   enter lady plinlimmon lady plin i hope gentlemen you have not been here long i feel myself peculiarly distinguished in the desire i understand you expressed of forming an acquaintance with me a man of your talents is not to be met with in every house  mr phrensy bows very low lord mel that bow says more than a pompous train of words   lady plin i am not insensible to its eloquence it flatters me as much as a dedication pray sir are you engaged in any work at present   mr phrensy i am only superintending a new edition of the works of a dear friend whom i have lately lost  the immortal classical phrensy   lord mel while mr tombstone is expatiating on the merits of his departed friend i will call upon sir pepper and return in a few minutes   lady plin pray do and bring sir pepper and isabella along with you the company is to rendezvous here exit lord melcourt indeed sir it is very amiable in you to suppress the effusions of your own powers to attend to the interest of another   mr phrensy it is not so much attending to the interest of my friend as it is consulting the interest of the nation while i am preparing this noble edition of his works for the general delight   lady plin but i have been so unfortunate as never to hear of phrensys name   mr phrensy what never heard of classical phrensy esquire   lady plin no i protest i never heard his name till you pronounced it   mr phrensy let me tell you lady plinlimmon if the rays of his genius have not pierced the dense atmosphere of wales that invelopes your mountains    lady plin mr tombstone you alarm me i had no idea of degrading you friend i will promote the subscription among all my acquaintance and do every thing in my power to atone for my seeming disrespect   mr phrensy i am calm again but you will excuse a little warmth in favor of a person who is as dear to me as myself we were inseparable we never differed upon the smallest point if one spoke the other listened if one slept the other nodded   lady plin ah such a friendship is seldom to be found i can assure you sir the warmth that just now broke from you has only served to exalt me in your esteem and as a proof of what i am saying i beg i may lay the cornerstone of our acquaintance with this little brilliant  gives him a ring mr phrensy this generosity subdues me   lady plin let the ring be as a passport to this apartment at all times and when you are at leisure i should wish to take some lessons of botany under your direction lord melcourt informs me that every science is within the range of your mind   mr phrensy i shall be happy in obeying your commands   lady plin you think sir that botany is a proper occupation for a female mind   mr phrensy nothing so proper give me leave to cite a couplet composed by my lamented friend applicable to this subject it is a happy couplet he sent it to lady nightshade who is well versed in the loves of the plants it runs thus delightful emblem of her softer power a womans proper study is a flower    lady plin exquisite couplet what a great man your friend was   mr phrensy the confidence you place in me this little twinkling monitor of your kindness your affability every thing prompts inclines urges commands compels me to undeceive you   lady plin to undeceive me what can you mean mr tombstone   mr phrensy i am not mr tombstone it is an assumed name a veil to cover me for certain purposes   lady plin what purposes who are you   mr phrensy bursting from my concealment like aeneas from his cloud know that i am classical phrensy it is phrensy speaks it is phrensy kneels it is phrensys lips now touch this hand   lady plin i did really imagine you was some great personage in disguise but explain the mystery of all this   mr phrensy envy and her train have of late carried on so atrocious a war against me that i have been persuaded to sham a retreat and give out that i am dead   lady plin excellent idea   mr phrensy in the mean time i am collecting subscriptions and shall return triumphantly to life under the cover of a superb edition of all my works   lady plin i comprehend you perfectly and am delighted with the confidence you repose in me   mr phrensy the family mr fashion the painter who is my particular friend are the only persons in the world who are entrusted with this literary secret   lady plin i shall be as silent as helicon   mr phrensy the heliconian stream is apt to babble it would be more accurate to say as silent as lethe   enter sir pepper miss plinlimmon lord melcourt and mr fashion lady plin this is the gentleman sir pepper whom lord melcourt speaks so highly of   sir p plin i am mr tombstones most obedient my wife is fond of literature you will find her versed in some of the best authors she is fond of conversing with the dead or to speak more properly with the living dead   mr phrensy her ladyship was conversing with the living dead when you entered   lady plin and i must add a favorite author   sir p plin is your lordship determined to set out for ireland as soon as the ceremony is over   lord mel the reason that compels me to leave you so soon is the business i have there which demands immediate dispatch   sir p plin i am surprised mr conscience the lawyer is not yet come with the writings   lord mel he will certainly be here today   miss plin what matters whether or no the lawyer comes i wish poor taffey we left on the road was arrived for it is the parson who speaks the prologue to loves play   mr fash aptly observed but the nuptial play miss plinlimmon is sometimes a tragicomedy the dialogue frequently uncouth vehement and boisterous what do you think yours will be   miss plin oh ours will be a gay farce of three acts   enter lady bellair lady b now we are all assembled let the master of the ceremonies instruct us what we are to do   lord mel the carriages are at the door suppose we take an airing through the park and lounge at the different buildings   lady b let me be mistress of the revels for this evening we will imagine the phaetons are triumphal cars and they shall convey us to the temple of mars where mr tombstone shall read to the company his new translation of the battle of the frogs   lady plin excellent i love analogy   lady b and as your ladyship is fond of analogy we will take some whipped syllabub in the pavilion of friendship and regale ourselves with icecreams in the temple of hymen   mr fash a little severe i think   lord mel where more is meant then meets the ear  offering his hand to miss plinlimmon exeunt end of the second act act iii scene  the temple of hymen the company eating icecreams sir pepper plinlimmon miss plinlimmon lord melcourt mr fashion and lady bellair sir p plin i think my lord this temple of hymen the most beautiful building in your park   mr fash this ice is excellent   miss plin cold food for the temple of hymen    mr fash it is not the only food   miss plin you mean bread and cheese and kisses   lord mel i beg lady bellair you will check your cicisbeo mr fashion and not let him libertinise with my diana   lady b what pretense can i have to restrain him fashion is like the air a chartered libertine free to play with every flower   miss plin egad he shall not play with me though   lady b tell me my dear why did your mamma leave us so abruptly   miss plin mamma i fancy has had enough of the temple of hymen   sir p plin your ladyship perceives this spoiled child has the liberty of saying what she pleases my wife is gone with her ingenious friend to study botany   lady b i should be sorry to constrain her ladyship   sir p plin be so good as to inform me who fancied these decorations are they indebted to the hand of any foreign artist   lord mel there is no occasion to apply to foreign auxiliaries for the purposes of elegant art  the native growth of our soil amply supplies the demands of taste in every department   sir p plin this relievo is happily executed come here isabella you understand mythology here is hymen attended by a group of cupids do you conceive the allegoric meaning of the artist   miss plin perfectly here is hymen with a torch in his hand that is i suppose to light the bride and bridegroom home and the dear little cupids i suppose foretell the children   sir p plin ridiculous you pervert every thing by your distorted applications but explain the remainder  you see night personated following hymen she throws over her frame a mantle studded with stars and among the stars appears a crescent    miss plin the mantle studded with stars designates the holy stillness and unruffled union of the marriage state   sir p plin very well indeed   miss plin and the crescent denotes the honeymoon    sir p plin there you relapse into your absurdity    mr fash miss plinlimmon will perhaps do me the honor to explain this compartment  here is hymen binding a shepherd and a shepherdess with a chain of flowers   miss plin it is your turn now you shall explain this    mr fash upon my word i think this a most excellent allegory and illustrates well the short triumph of matrimony  the chain of roses is easily broken and the roses soon fade   lord mel fashion speaks the language of an inveterate bachelor yet every thing in nature condemns his sarcasm the birds that make this grove reecho with their harmony what are all their songs but so many hymns in honor of the married state   mr fash i ask your pardon lord melcourt the economy of your grove will not assist your argument in defense of hymen for every feathered couple who were so happy the last spring are now divorced and all the harmony and love which now reign in your woods is the result of separation and of new engagements   lord mel truce to your licentious insinuations to purify the temple that has been so profaned i entreat miss plinlimmon to favor us with the song in honor of hymen with which she enchanted the company last night    miss plin i am ready to comply with your request   sir p plin with your ladyships permission i will go and look for the botanists   lady b he is positively jealous aside  indeed sir pepper you must not go till you have heard the song   sir p plin i am all obedience   the song by miss plinlimmon i oh young affections glowing train by mutual fond endearment won at hymens altar claim the chain that twines two willing hearts in one ii have ye not seen in floras bower two roses on one stem respire so formed by passions blending power two hearts are throned on one desire sir p plin i presume i have now your ladyships leave to wait upon the botanists   mr fash sir pepper you will only interrupt the scholar in the study of nature  the eminent professor under whom lady plinlimmon is now acquiring a new science would wish not to be deranged   sir p plin very likely  nevertheless i shall make them a visit   lady b we will accompany you to the house   exeunt omnes scene  bookroom lady plinlimmon and mr phrensy at a table covered with plants and flowers lady plin what a wonderful system have you brought me acquainted with i never could have conceived there were such astonishing things in nature as male and female flowers    mr phrensy i have most assuredly let your ladyship a little into floras secrets   lady plin male and female flowers i am petrified but tell me learned professor when the flowers are at a distance from one another how they communicate their mutual passion   mr phrensy there nature interposes her happiest stratagem she calls her western gales her amorous zephyrs and they on heir fragrant wings convey the lovers to each other   lady plin now sir as you have led me as it were behind the curtain into floras greenroom i confess i am not much edified at the morals of the plants indeed the flowers appear to be an abandoned profligate race  here is a honey suckle which you say contains five males and only one female  this modest snowdrop you tell me has six husbands    mr phrensy indeed nature has been rather partial to your sex in her economy of plants   lady plin poor things what a pity it is they are not endowed with sensibility   mr phrensy i have observed since the ladies of fashion have applied to the study of botany they are not only ambitious of rivaling the flowers in beauty but they have also endeavored in some degree to rival them in their other prerogatives   lady plin take care mr phrensy you are growing censorious  enter sir pepper plinlimmon you cannot imagine sir pepper how delighted i am with the beautiful and sublime science of botany   sir p plin indeed   lady plin this learned gentleman has raised as it were the veil of nature and has revealed to me some of her secrets and i must own secrets that excite my astonishment according to the illustrations of this learned professor the chalice of every flower is a kind of a house of bad fame   sir p plin ironically then a lady of your unspotted virtue ought to shrink as the sensitiveplant from a study that presents to you nothing but scenes of immorality   lady plin there can be no harm in gratifying a literary curiosity but i assure you sir pepper i shall be apt to think it is not extremely decent to wear a nosegay   sir p plin if you would read the delightful poem of the loves of the plants you need not give this gentleman any further trouble at present i must take the liberty of desiring him to leave us alone as i have something to communicate to you in private   mr phrensy i obey your commands in our next lecture we will expatiate on the dews that refresh the flowers at night   exit mr phrensy lady plin well sir pepper what have you to communicate nothing i presume very entertaining   sir p plin you now receive a positive order not to admit that literary fop any more into your study   lady plin what sir pepper when the ray of knowledge begins to dawn must it expire at your uncreating word   sir p plin your ladyships metaphorical expressions have no effect upon me and give me leave to observe that i have always found you refractory and uncomplying with any requests   lady plin how can you be so unjust where is the wife throughout wales that is more complacent did i ever refuse to comply with a request of yours from january to january indeed sir pepper i might complain of the very few indulgences you ever granted me    sir p plin dare you complain of my want of indulgence when there is not a whim that i have not always been ready to indulge you in when the gardening parson from england came to us last year did i not submit to have the front of my old forest cicatrised into clumbs like large pies did he not fling a confining belt as he called it round my place as if he thought the hills vales and woods were going to run away did i not let him to please you zig zag the avenue in such a manner that i could hardly find the way to my own house   lady plin you must allow that plinlimmon castle wanted a touch of the modern bard   sir p plin then i was obliged to endure his perpetual panegyric upon himself how he was admitted to all the great tables in town how he chose a picture for this lord  and a fan for that lady    lady plin however his visit was not long he stayed with us but a little month   sir p plin if it had not been for the death of the french cook he would have been at plinlimmon castle at this moment   lady plin do you choose to put my patience to any further trial   sir p plin recall if you please the physician from the north who came a practisehunting into wales did he not come twice a day to the castle to brace your nerves was not this another indulgence there you passed day after day languishing on a sopha then the room for sooth was darkened as you could endure only a kind of twilight which you called a jour doux then i was never to be admitted because i spoke so loud   lady b the doctor said you was too boisterous sir pepper for the chamber of a valetudinarian notwithstanding your incredulity concerning the bad state of my nerves at that time i can assure you that it was to the sopha and to the doctor that i owe    sir p plin more than you will choose to allow   lady plin dont be scurrilous sir pepper   sir p plin then there was the fencible colonel but i have done let me only entreat you not to complain any more of my not granting you any indulgences zounds madam the pope at rome could not have granted you more indulgences than i have but no more i have only to beg of you to stay here till i return with some papers for you to sign and which lord melcourt and mr fashion are to witness   exit sir pepper plinlimmon lady plin never was a person of delicate feelings so thrown away as i was when i consented to be the wife of sir pepper   enter mr phrensy mr phrensy i watched sir pepper out i heard him go along the gallery muttering as if he was much displeased i am afraid he has been endeavoring to ruffle your angelic temper   lady plin he has absolutely imposed his commands upon me not to receive your visits   mr phrensy i rejoice to hear it   lady plin what do you mean mr phrensy   mr phrensy prohibition like a glass of bitters stimulates the appetite and awakens our partialities i dare say i now appear more amiable to your ladyship than i did before   lady plin i confess at least your presumption does not offend me but i am sorry to inform you that you must not stay with me at present sir pepper is returning immediately and lord melcourt and mr fashion are coming with him   mr phrensy they cannot be here so soon  mr fashion was just now in earnest conversation with lady bellair in the long cathedral arbor and lord melcourt was    lady plin you are mistaken  for i hear them coming what can be done it is too late to escape  you must not take refuge in the bedchamber my blabbing maid is there  conceal yourself behind this curtain  lets down the curtain that hangs over the bookshelves mr phrensy peeping from behind the curtain i cannot at least want entertainment where there are so many books   lady plin how can you be jocular now you see the agitation i am in    enter sir pepper plinlimmon lord melcourt and mr fashion sir p plin these gentlemen will have the goodness to be witnesses to your signing this paper   lord mel how does your ladyship proceed in the study of botany   lady plin at the desire of sir pepper i have laid aside the thoughts of botany for the present   lord mel it is a pity your ladyship should not avail yourself of the advantage of being under the same roof with so eminent a professor   mr fash a person of your ladyships abilities would have made a rapid progress under so skilful a director he has a way of bringing his scholars forward in a very short time   sir p plin he has the way of bringing himself forward in a very short time be so good as to sign your name offering the paper you keep these gentlemen waiting   mr fash i am sure we have nothing better to do than converse with this learned lady   lady plin you are very obliging but i will not any longer intrude on your time   she writes her name  then lord melcourt and mr fashion sign mr fash pray lord melcourt have you a virgil on those shelves behind the curtain tombstone and i had a dispute about a passage in the fourth book   lord mel no that is a mere ladys library nothing but moderns  i ran up a few shelves and furnished them with some everyday volumes for the convenience of any lady who might occupy these apartments   lady plin mr fashion there may be a virgil behind the curtain but not the virgil you mean   mr fash you allude to the translation no that will not do i want to consult the original   lady plin then you must have recourse to the library below   lord mel but why does your ladyship drop that curtain over the books   lady plin i found it hanging and i make it a rule to leave things exactly as i find them   sir p plin the curtain my dear i think was up just now when i was with you   lady plin was it my dear i do not recollect  very true it was te sun played so powerfully upon the books i was afraid it would tarnish the beautiful bindings so i dropped the curtain    mr fash i love beautiful bindings and typographical luxury pray let me be favored with the sight of the books   lady plin not worth your inspection  a mere female library and authors for women   lord mel allow me to indulge fashions curiosity as for the suns spoiling the books it matters not when the bindings are the worse for wear the books may have new bindings a wellbound book is not like a ladys reputation which once soiled can never   draws up the curtain  discovers mr phrensy there was indeed a virgil behind the curtain   mr fash an author for a lady   lord mel but not so well bound as fashion expected   mr phrensy gentlemen you may laugh if you please but we enterprising fellows are now and then exposed to these untoward discoveries they are inevitable incidents in the comedy of life this is an incident    sir p plin arrogant pedant if this was not lord melcourts house my cane would chastise your insolence   lady plin i assure my dear this gentleman had received my commands not to enter these apartments any more at that instant i heard you returning   mr phrensy and to save you from an object so disagreeable as myself i secreted myself behind that curtain   sir p plin daring wretch what is it you mean do you presume to make the personal attractions of that lady the object of your bold pretensions   lady plin well sir pepper since we are among friends i give you my word that if ever i could be persuaded to deviate from the path of decorum and make a little faux pas it should not be with a literary person   mr fash your ladyship is perfectly right the literary heroes are not renowned in the annals of gallantry a bookworm is a poor harmless creature without a sting   sir p plin what you say mr fashion is sensible and judicious i have heard it observed that a lieutenant of the guards is more formidable to a married man than the whole body of the antiquarian society mr tombstone will excuse the warmth i was just now surprised into   mr phrensy pray do not mention it your prohibition with regard to my coming to this apartment shall be strictly obeyed and i shall for the future look for the honor of your ladyships society only in the drawing room which you know is a neutral apartment and accessible to every part of the family   sir p plin gentlemen your obedient i must return with these papers   exit lord mel well this scene has ended much better than i expected the storm would have fallen heavy upon tombstone had it not been for your ladyships happy sarcasm upon the gallantry of the learned   mr phrensy your lordship need not call me tombstone her ladyship knows my story there is nothing respecting myself that is a secret to her ladyship   lord mel i am glad to hear it but i must beg leave to absent myself i hope your ladyship will excuse me   lady plin but why will your lordship deprive us of your company   lord mel consider madam i am at the eve of being married  my mind is so full  i have so many things to think of   mr phrensy what can your lordship have to think of every thing flows so smoothly to your wishes  you have no more occasion to think than a translator   mr fash no more he has and i could undertake to prove that his lordship is a kind of a translator himself and even a translator into various languages   lord mel how do you make that out   mr fash i have seen you sometimes in liquor and then you translate yourself into a beast   mr phrensy very good   mr fash you will soon be married and then you will translate yourself into another kind of animal   mr phrensy you mistake that will not be his own doing   mr fash very true some intimate friend will do that translation for him   lord mel will not your ladyship take my part against these profane batchelors   lady plin the arrows these gentlemen shoot are not dipped in gall   lord mel nor are their points very keen but i must be going   lady plin as the party is breaking up suppose mr phrensy you attend me to the neutral apartment as you ingeniously term it   mr phrensy i am at your command   offers his hand  exit with lady plinlimmon lord mel there go two the most ridiculous personages   mr fash and the best suited to one another   lord mel i wish my future bride and i were half as well adapted to one another   mr fash what melcourt do you feel fainthearted   lord mel faith i do the whimsicality of the different persons under this roof has occasioned some laughing which has served to divert my attention from the main object but when my thoughts rest upon my approaching nuptials my mind shrinks from its purpose   mr fash oh this is nothing but a vapor fit a qualm before matrimony it will pass away   lord mel never never   mr fash she is handsome  very rich   lord mel did she possess all the barbaric gold of the city it would not atone for her deficiencies in other respects   mr fash what do you call deficiencies the little rusticities of her homebred education will disappear in time she will catch the tone of the stage she is entering upon the continual action of surrounding example in higher life will wear away her peculiarities and she will insensibly glide into the general mass   lord mel you are calm and philosophic but i cannot be cooled and philosophised into the approval of what i am sensible is not strictly honorable which is leading and as it were betraying a young woman to the altar for whom i entertain no passion no preference no esteem   mr fash your good nature will prompt you to treat her with civility her simplicity will explain your politeness into love and the torrent of amusements in town will prevent her prying into your private pleasureground   lord mel fashion you talk it well but i do protest if i could be prevailed upon to marry this young woman disliking her as i do i should feel an internal degradation that would poison all my days   mr fash what can be done it is too late to recede the welsh family will be in an uproar   lord mel i have a scheme  a lucky thought occurred this morning i think i have hit upon a method of escaping from the chains i have been forging for myself and in preparing the girl for the event i shall contrive to soften her disappointment by a kind of innocent imposition which will make her believe that the breaking off the intended marriage is her own act   mr fash this is at once generous and humane to ward off the point that would wound her pardonable vanity in the expectation of being lady melcourt but what is your plan   lord mel that i will communicate to you in a more private place and if my stratagem should not succeed i must then have recourse to your superior invention   exeunt end of the third act act iv miss plin reading aloud  oh happy state when souls each other draw  enter lord melcourt your calling upon me when i am alone is very kind i am now convinced your lordship has a great regard for me   lord mel may i take the liberty of asking what book has the honor of engaging your attention   miss plin i have been dressing my expectation with love verses reads for thee the spouse prepares the bridal ring for thee white virgins hymeneals sing  but what makes you look so grave when you are so near being a bridegroom a little bird sung in my ear that tomorrow is to be the happy day and i suppose your lordship is come to inform me of the happy tidings   lord mel no indeed i did not come for that purpose i came with another view   miss plin i hope it will not rain tomorrow there must not be a speck of a cloud in the skies on our wedding day   lord mel i must beg your serious attention to what i have to say to you takes a chair offers her one they sit  if i seem a little embarrassed you will have the goodness to excuse me i think it my duty to inform you that when i was last abroad i had the misfortune of being introduced to a young nun who gained my affections and though that accomplished woman is no more    miss plin if she is no more i have nothing to apprehend for with all her want of accomplishments isabella plinlimmon must be superior to a dead nun   lord mel it is not only that    miss plin your lordship did not fall in love with the whole convent   lord mel no no when i lost my constantia my warm affections flew to her tomb   miss plin and when your warm affections have caught cold at her tomb they will fly back again   lord mel never never with her they have taken up their everlasting residence   miss plin well let them you and i will make new affections   lord mel aside nothing will do she is determined to have me   miss plin what does your lordship say   lord mel i am afraid miss plinlimmon there are other objectionable circumstances relative to myself with all the appearance of affability and condescension i can assure you that i am most vehemently passionate   miss plin matrimony will cure that vice i have heard my mamma say that marriage is a great tamer   lord mel i have also the misfortune of walking in my sleep and i get out of the window and walk upon the roof of the house   miss plin as long as you do not insist upon my walking with you i do not call that an objectionable circumstance and when you are tired of imhaling the night breezes from the top of the house you will find me overjoyed to receive you at your return   lord mel rising from his chair i see miss plinlimmon you make a jest of what my delicate feelings prompt me to reveal to you   miss plin rising quite the reverse your candor endears you the more to me and to return you an equivalent of candor and unreserve on my part i will unfold to your lordship a secret though i am unwilling to disclose it   lord mel well what have you to communicate   miss plin it is what you would have found out if i did not reveal it but in this charming moment of mutual confidence i cannot resist telling my love that i have crooked legs   lord mel crooked legs the devil   miss plin do not let such a trifle discompose you my aunt lady waddle is made just the same as i am and she has eleven children   lord mel if you please miss plinlimmon we will put an end to this discourse   miss plin if you desire it we shall have time enough to talk when we are man and wife adieu i am going to lady bellair and will tell her all that has passed in this delightful confidential intercourse   lord mel i must insist upon your not revealing one word to lady bellair of what i have been saying to you   miss plin as you please your lordship will find me through life strictly observant of your commands   exit miss plinlimmon lord mel were my debts and difficulties treble to what they are i would not extricate myself on the condition of marrying that thing that vile antithesis half a wit and half an idiot  enter mr fashion oh fashion you never came so opportunely i am at a loss how to act my scheme has entirely failed    mr fash then i must be your pilot to steer you through this intricate perplexity   lord mel her idiot fondness increases with what should have excited her disgust   mr fash leave me to construct the means of withdrawing from you this girls partiality i presume i am empowered to say whatever i please   lord mel you may indulge the utmost latitude paint me in whatever colors you choose   mr fash well i will endeavor to do my best for you i have a good knack you know at a caricature   lord mel but do not make me too ridiculous   mr fash remember you just now gave me unlimited powers   lord mel very true i resign myself to your judgment let me appear absurd fickle preposterous any thing to get rid of this matrimonial engagement   mr fash suppose while i am unwinding her affections and desires from you i should endeavor to bottom and twist them round myself   lord mel what you marry her are you in earnest will you quit your free roving pleasureboat for the monotonous hulk of matrimony   mr fash her guineas will decorate and enliven the hulk   lord mel well if you can make a proselyte of the girl you have my full permission and best wishes here is my license which with a change of a name will serve your purpose and you may get married immediately without acquainting any of the family of it   mr fash i will go and inform lady bellair of your resolution and of my project   lord mel i should be delighted if the girl was to take a fancy to you    mr fash we shall see   exeunt scene  lady bellairs apartment lady bellair  miss plinlimmon lady b what you choose to say in private is of no consequence but before company i must insist upon your never mentioning my husband   miss plin then tell me as we are alone i long to hear what occasioned the separation between lord bellair and you   lady b restrain this idle curiosity it does not become    miss plin did your husband walk in his sleep was he in love with a dead nun   lady b how wildly you talk   miss plin not so wildly neither i know what i know but i will not tell   enter sir pepper plinlimmon sir p plin i take the liberty of calling upon your ladyship to express my uneasiness that the lawyer from town is not yet arrived the post is come in and i have no information about him   lady b delay is the characteristic of his order when that grays inn slug has crawled over and covered with his black slime an acre of parchment we shall see him here   miss plin but mr taffey who is to perform the ceremony is as necessary as the lawyer   sir p plin as for mr taffey i have a letter from him he will be here this evening   miss plin then all is well  rejoicing extravagantly  enter lord melcourt my lord my lord taffey will be here this evening and tomorrow i shall be the fondest of wives   lord mel flattering as your expectancy may be to me i wish you would restrain this inordinate exultation   miss plin well papa i will go and pack up my fine clothes for i suppose we shall set out for ireland immediately after the ceremony i rejoice to think that taffey will be here this evening   exit lord mel aside to lady bellair was there ever such a hottentot   sir p plin you dont appear lord melcourt to be struck with the artless manner of my girl   lord mel i ask your pardon i am exceedingly struck   sir p plin she has a few rusticities adhering to her all which will drop from her like dross from gold   lord mel in the crucible of lady bellairs refining conversation   sir p plin very true i am certain lady bellair would perform miracles on my daughter  if she pleased   lady b but why sir pepper do you doubt my inclination   sir p plin because you fine ladies dislike trouble i will be bold to say that in the course of the winter you never do any thing your inclination that is to say your vanity does not prompt you to do   lady b i ask your pardon sir pepper   sir p plin indulge for once an old mans curiosity and edify me by recording some instances where you act in opposition to the dictates of your inclination   lord mel this is a perfect challenge   lady b well let me recollect i go every other sunday in the early part of the evening to an old aunt who lives at the antipodes of the fashionable part of the town and there i retail to her the historic scandal of the fortnight and then she reads to me through her green spectacles out of a folio a sermon of the last century   lord mel i hope sir pepper you will give lady bellair some credit for that   lady b then i go once in the winter to the ancient music   sir p plin that i suppose is a concert performed by the decayed musicians   lady b not exactly so it is however a very edifying concert and composed of those hoary venerable notes that in days of yore delighted the ears of harry the eighth and anne bullen and is now a very suitable recreation for old batchelors old maids and emigrant nuns but to continue the narrative of my mortified inclination my carriage every morning makes one of the long procession of coaches that besiege the circulating library in bond street   sir p plin that denotes your ladyships fondness for literature   lady b i beg yor pardon sir pepper literature is my aversion i never look into a book but i cannot avoid calling every morning at the library it is a kind of literary tavern where the waiters are in perpetual demand a dish of elegant sonnets for miss simper satires with a poignant sauce for mrs grumble a sirloin of history for lady sleepless a broiled devil of private anecdote highly peppered with scandal for lady angelica worthless it would amuse you sir pepper to see these female academics enter the porch of hookham college their cheeks paled by study a little relieved by a thin stratum of morning rouge then you would wonder at the method the learned professors adopt of supplying the impatience of their pupils for example  one lady receives the first volume of an author of which she will never enquire for the second at the same time she receives the second volume of another author of which she has not yet an idea of the first   sir p plin give me leave to observe this vague method of reading must create a kind of chaos without consistency   lady b consistency is a vulgar word we do not admit into our vocabulary and as for the chaos you disapprove of i really think there is to be found the whole merit for this miscellaneous variegated unconnected reading forms the beautiful dovetailed mosaic literature of the female mind   sir p plin i hope you will allow lady plinlimmon to be a brilliant exception to your general description   lady b most undoubtedly i have a long list of exceptions but not to interrupt the narrative of my own memoirs  i am sometimes obliged to mingle with the elegant mob at a sale of pictures   sir p plin a sale of pictures must be very improving you there frequently meet with the works of the old masters   lady b the ladies of fashion do not go to auctions for the sake of the old masters do they lord melcourt   lord mel no indeed a bow from lord gauze a smile from lord flimsy or a compliment from sir gossamer bagatelle effaces the names of rembrant corregio and vandyke   lady b however we play with the catalogue and we stare at the pictures and i have heard it observed that in the two late celebrated sales the love of virtue made the ladies gaze at some pictures from which their grandmammas would have turned away   sir p plin indeed   lady b but then i will say for the ladies that they stole a glance at these pictures through the medium of their long veils which you know transmits a kind of drapery to the paintings but to proceed i am under the obligation sometimes of getting up in the middle of the night to be in readiness to go to a new play and with all my precaution i never can get there before the middle of the second act   sir p plin that is very unlucky   lady b not in the least for i never listen to the play   sir p plin but does not your talking loud in the first row disturb the audience   lady b i never occupy the first row i place the old ladies in the first and second row they have nothing to do poor things but to listen to the play and then i sit snug on the last form which we call among ourselves tattle row and then perhaps i am seated between sir voluble prattle and colonel easy and we three converse and titter a la sourdine the whole evening but i am afraid i grow dull   sir p plin quite the reverse i assure you i presume your ladyship pays more attention to the opera the softness of the italian language has something enchanting to a delicate ear   lady b i know nothing of the italian language there is no attaining the knowledge of it without passing through the perplexing jumbling crossroads of a grammar that would shake my intellects to pieces   sir p plin still the music may flatter the ear though you do not comprehend the words   lady b i comprehend the music as little as i do the words   sir p plin it is then the dancing i conclude delights you    lady b no the dancing does not particularly interest me indeed i cannot see the dancing in my box for i generally sit with my back to the stage   sir p plin as neither the music nor the dancing has any allurement i suppose your ladyship seldom or never goes to the opera   lady b i ask your pardon sir pepper i never omit an opera   sir p plin what then can be the attraction i really see nothing to entice you   lady b is it nothing sir pepper to lean half out of ones box with the head inclined to give the easy feather a more graceful play which looks a meteor waving in the air and which as the poet says allures attention from the tuneful scene gives fops the flutter and old maids the spleen is it nothing sir pepper to have all the opera glasses levelled at one to sit in my box as on a throne the unrivalled queen of fopland   lord mel i must confess lady bellair you have an extensive dominion fopland is a very populous country   lady b so it is and what is still better there is not an old man to be found in it   sir p plin i am sorry i am excluded from being one of your majestys subjects   lady b out of regard to your gallantry i will introduce a bill to naturalise you sir pepper but not to lose the thread of my narrative i must inform you that i go once in the winter to an assembly given by the wife of my physician there all his pale convalescents stalk about like ghosts   lord mel and to conclude the description the lemonade is intentionally made so acid that the doctor is obliged to return all the visits of his company the next day   sir p plin very good indeed   lady b you perceive what a mortified life i am obliged to lead   sir p plin if your historic pencil has drawn a true resemblance i must confess a fashionable lady is to me an incomprehensible being   exit lady b now we have got rid of the ridiculous baronet i must assume a graver tone you know i can be very serious when occasion demands the more i see of sir peppers absurd daughter the more i am sensibly affected at the thought of your approaching nuptials the long train of peculiar distresses incident to our family i wish not to see terminated by means so unworthy and ignonimous   lord mel i do not comprehend you   lady b by marrying a young woman you are ashamed of our family has been long involved in various difficulties it has been known to misfortune but it has never been acquainted with dishonor imagine two large portals opening before you through one of which you should be obliged to pass imagine one presenting to your view a brilliant perspective a sun streaming from a summer sky and illuminating an earthly paradise the other unfolding to your vision a lowering atmosphere hanging over a blasted heath picture to yourself these words engraved on the first portal they who pass through me must cast away honor  fancy on the other you behold this inscription  this road leads to honorable poverty through which of these arches would you direct your footsteps oh my dear brother in the agitation you betray i read your heroic answer   lord mel before you had communicated your sentiments to me upon this subject i had made my reflection and had resolved but mr fashion whom i am glad to see  enter fashion will best unfold the plan we had formed together i refer you to him the confusion i am at present under will excuse my leaving you so abruptly   exit mr fash heyday what is the matter with melcourt he stalked by me in dumb show like a tragedy hero   lady b the agitation you perceive he is in is the honest working of nature it will do him no harm my brother tells me you have something to communicate to me   mr fash i have and it is of importance i was commissioned by him as he did not choose to speak himself that he is determined to break off this match   lady b he partly intimated his resolution but who undertakes to inform the girl of his resolution   mr fash that falls to my part in the play   lady b what do you propose saying to the poor girl how will you open your unpleasant embassy   mr fash not so unpleasant because i intend to propose myself   lady b propose yourself   mr fash as i do not occupy so high a station in life as lord melcourt i mean by proposing myself to be a kind of a parachute and so break as it were her fall   lady b you are very kind indeed you may not perhaps be so invincible in the eyes of the young lady as you are in your own   mr fash i rely on your friendly assistance   lady b there you are mistaken but do not impute my declining to cooperate with you to a fear that this may be the means of withdrawing your assiduities and attentions from me i hope i act from a more noble impulse i am ready to confess that the exclusive preference and predilection you have shown me of late have gratified my vanity but like the waves that beat against the heedless rock they have not shook my constancy to the man whose name i bear   mr fash the playful gaiety of your disposition led me astray and i thought you was delighted to return to society unaccompanied by lord bellair   lady b i own i have the appearance of airiness and levity but my gaiety is frequently assumed and i have recourse to dissipation more as a medicine than a feast   mr fash as you are so kind as to speak to me in so unreserved a manner i think it incumbent on me to declare that i have no inbred aversion to the girl i am not so fastidious so difficult as melcourt and i will add that was i to succeed i would do every thing in my power to contribute to her happiness and give me also leave to say that i believe i am not indifferent to her   lady b with such honorable sentiments as you now assure me you entertain you have my permission to make the trial mutual propensity believe me is the best security for happiness the smiling flowers she scatters from her hand can alone enliven the domestic walk it is she who displays to the bride and bridegroom that eternal spring which all lovers talk of but which so few experience it is she who gilds and dissipates the clouds of care and pours upon the soul the cheerful sunshine of the mind   exeunt end of the fourth act act v miss plinlimmon sitting at a table writing i am glad to find that my letters are finished i cannot conceive what mr fashion has to say to me in private these letters will make my friends very happy  enter mr fashion you are punctual to your time i was just thinking of you mr fashion you are a personable man  i wonder you are not married   mr fash the reason i am not married is because there is only one miss plinlimmon but give me leave to tell you that you are too late for the post   miss plin these letters are not intended for todays post nor to morrows post but they are intended for the post the day after the wedding you must know that i am bound by a solemn promise to write two letters the day after my marriage and as we shall be on our road to ireland on that day and consequently shall have no time to write i thought it would be a good plan to write beforehand and date the letters after the wedding which you see i have done and have signed myself isabella melcourt   mr fash very ingeniously contrived indeed may i take the liberty of asking who this letter is to   miss plin it is to mrs evans an old maiden aunt who was always very kind to me there are no secrets if you please i will read it to you   mr fash i am sure it must be worth hearing if it comes from your pen   miss plin reads dear aunt yesterday the holy ceremony was performed we all wept  mamma had an hysteric  two beautiful tears stole down the cheek of my amiable lord and when he put on the ring his hand trembled     mr fash but miss plinlimmon allow me to ask how do you know all this will happen   miss plin there is always weeping at a wedding as much as at a funeral   mr fash well i plead ignorance for i never assisted at a wedding   miss plin then get your white handkerchief ready tomorrow morning but let me see where i left off   reads  when he put on the ring his hand trembled after the ceremony we sat down to a sumptuous collation we lay at a town whose name i forget you cannot dear madam have any conception of his lordships kindness to me  i am dear aunt your thrice happy niece isabella melcourt postcript i should have written a longer letter had i not a bad headache      mr fash but permit me to ask how do you foresee you will have a bad headache   miss plin i heard my mammainlaw say that she had a terrible headache the day after she married so it is very probable    mr fash i perceive there is another letter who is honored with this mark of your remembrance   miss plin this is to miss bluehose member of the female literary society at carnarvon   mr fash with this lady i suppose you assume a higher style   miss plin i endeavor in this letter to write exactly as miss bluehose talks   reads sweet academic friend aurora yesterday put on her best saffron robe to assist at our wedding we are on our road to ireland my lord you know is a native of that kingdom what a delightful country must that be which produces such men last night three minutes before twelve i ascended the expecting couch    mr fash very happy expression that   miss plin i am glad you are pleased with it the expecting couch is in the manner and style of our academic society but to proceed reads history informs us my dear miss bluehose of the bed of procustes of the bed of ware of the lit de justice and of the bed of honor i wonder that in this learned catalogue the historian omitted the bed of hymen   mr fash it is an unpardonable omission indeed   miss plin now we have done with the letters be so good as to inform me why you look so serious i begin to think you envy lord melcourt  well if you do i will tell you for your comfort that if i was to be a widow and had moulted away my black feathers that is to say when i had shed my weeds and got rid of my sorrow i really think you would stand a good chance   mr fash you flatter me extremely but to advert to the subject which induced me to beg this private audience i must inform you that nothing but the great respect i entertain for you could compel me to mention lord melcourt in terms not the most favorable   miss plin i know what you allude to but he has promised papa never to touch a card again   mr fash i do not allude to his passion for gaming i point to quite a different thing   miss plin i know what you mean there too he has told me all he clambers up the roof of the house every night   mr fash clambers up the roof of the house i cannot tell what he has chosen to communicate to you but i dare say he has not given you any hint of what my regard for you prompts me to reveal to keep you no longer in suspense melcourt does not love you i can scarcely suppress my indignation when i behold so enchanting so learned so witty a young lady as miss plinlimmon become    miss plin how kind you are   mr fash become i say the dupe of that indigent peer who only wishes to have his debts paid by your fortune he will look upon you with no greater sensibility than he does his old banker in the city he will set you aside like an useless piece of lumber   miss plin you petrify me mr fashion but i have a resource left which will prevent my being reduced to an useless piece of lumber   mr fash and what is that resource   miss plin it is a resource which belongs to the rights of women a curtain lecture   mr fash oh that will have no effect   miss plin i know that my mammainlaw has frequent recourse to that expedient   mr fash and what has been her success her nocturnal murmurings and her loud matin song what have they produced but an airy talkative family of bickerings and discontent   miss plin it is very true   mr fash i have frequently been astonished at lord melcourts cold indifference toward you   miss plin indeed he has not said one kind word to me since i have been at melcourt hall   mr fash then the vehemence of his character    miss plin he told me himself he was as cross as the devil   mr fash then i have wondered at the contempt with which he presumes to speak of you   miss plin i dare say he laughs at me behind my back   mr fash i have heard him say you are an idiot   miss plin i an idiot did he dare call me an idiot i who am one of the female academics at carnarvon i an idiot with whom miss bluehose corresponds i an idiot who have been electrified and magnetised i an idiot who am acquainted with mr omega the famous jew botanist and have feasted as his house upon his hebrew roots   mr fash notwithstanding all these credentials of your wit you find what he says of you   miss plin i feel the blood of the plinlimmons rise within me   mr fash i should not be surprised if under the idea of your being an idiot he should confine you in some old castle in ireland without allowing you pen ink or paper to write to your friend miss bluehose without having the pleasure of being magnetised and without ever having the gratification of dining upon hebrew roots   miss plin i renounce him from this moment with this breath blows through her fingers i blow away all my love imagine you see it floating through the air never to return to lord melcourt again   mr fash methinks i behold the fairy chariot bearing away your affections oh that i could arrest the richly freighted vehicle and seize the invaluable prize   miss plin indeed are you in earnest   mr fash i am upon my honor   miss plin ah but you are so wild and you love all the women   mr fash i am like other young men when under no particular engagement like a bird in the grove i wing from bough to bough but once married i should be as domestic and as constant as the turtledove   miss plin if it be so i could be almost induced    mr fash come come let me seize this coy hand  show you have a spirit to reward as well as to resent   miss plin laughing it would be a good trick to play the irish peer   mr fash the study of my life would be your happiness   miss plin are you a gentleman   mr fash that you know by my name  and in point of character i am totally different from lord melcourt  i love you passionately   miss plin that is no unpleasing intelligence   mr fash i do not walk in my sleep   mise plin i am very glad to hear that   mr fash but no time is to be lost  this license of lord melcourts with a small change will serve our purpose   miss plin taffey will sow us together in a twinkle   mr fash let us fly to the parson   exeunt scene  another apartment enter sir pepper plinlimmon well if what i am informed of should prove true that my girl has no inclination to lord melcourt i shall not force her  lady plin behind the scenes where is sir pepper where is sir pepper   sir p plin i hear lady plinlimmons voice  now she is coming to pour upon me as from a wide mortarpiece   enter lady plinlimmon lady plin do you call me a wide mortarpiece sir pepper  but let that pass  i come to demand your authority over this wayward girl of ours who pretends to dislike lord melcourt because he is not forsooth sentimentally in love with her   sir p plin without mutual affection there is no living together   lady plin have we not lived these fifteen years together   sir p plin yes and how have we lived   enter lady bellair lady plin i have been gently expostulating with sir pepper on his concurring with isabellas whimsical objection to lord melcourt   lady b i confess i side with sir pepper   lady plin is it possible   lady b though the loss is my brothers i shall not offer a word to reconcile sir pepper to an engagement that does not meet with his daughters approbation   lady plin i am astonished to hear lady bellair encourage a rustic notion that is unknown to the regions of fashion   lady b your ladyship must allow that mutual happiness is the end proposed it is the mark which if the bride and bridegroom in the higher sphere do not hit it is because they take a false aim   lady plin morality too   lady b am not i an instance of the folly of hurrying into an unavoidable engagement   lady plin not in the least does not the world encircle you with all its attractions do you not enjoy the advantages of wedlock without the encumbrances  your lords title and a handsome allowance   lady b your ladyship forgets that sir pepper is present   sir p plin i beg she may not be interrupted on my account   lady plin give me leave to ask in what manner your ladyship can be supposed to be a sufferer from your being separated from lord bellair do your jewels shine less bright is the ostrichfeather on your cap less playful is the lace    sir p plin zounds lady plinlimmon your head is like a newspaper after a birthday  full of nothing but gauzes foils and trimmings   lady plin well i stand corrected i give up the point concerning my daughter since i find every body is against me   enter lord melcourt lord mel i am happy to find lady plinlimmon here i am impatient to make this open declaration to her that the concern i feel in not being allowed to expect the honor of her alliance is lost in the higher consideration of miss plinlimmons happiness   lady plin indeed my lord you are too good to give way to the absurd objections of an ignorant girl   enter mr fashion and miss plinlimmon mr phrensy and mr fancy mr fashion and miss plinlimmon kneel miss plin dear papa give me and my husband your blessing   sir p plin your husband   lady plin your husband   mr phrensy it is even so i had the honor of giving her away   lady plin what do you say to this lord melcourt  to mr fashion audacious wretch to steal my daughter   lord mel i can assure your ladyship fashion is one of the most ancient families in the kingdom and has a title in obeyance   lady plin well if he has a title in obeyance   sir p plin but will lord melcourt vouch for his character   lord mel her ladyship looks to the gaudy distinction of title you sir look for something more substantial then let me tell you that fashion possesses those titles which virtues patent only can bestow honor and integrity   sir p plin then i am satisfied come lady plinlimmon let us forgive our child   going up to mr fashion and lady plinlimmon mr phrensy but who is to reward me for my epithalamium to whom shall i consign it   lord mel i will tell you  consign it to the firegrate that is the only way to insure it a warm reception   mr phrensy your envy at my talents prompts you to use so pitiful a conceit   lord mel well phrensy i will indulge another conceit which will not offend you so much and that is i hope as long as you choose to be dead you will live at melcourt hall   mr phrensy egad melcourt hall is so delightful a sepulcher i do not believe i shall ever wish to be alive again   lord mel do you then never intend to return to life   mr phrensy yes i do as soon as i have by means of my subscription completed my poetical loan my return to life will be a kind of an ovation the triumphal procession shall begin with my odes each on his fiery pegasus my satires like tomahawks shall next appear then my elegies shall move like a weeping train of female captives to these shall succeed my epigrams a brisk troop of archers with their pointed darts my grand epic like a large unwieldy elephant shall march by itself then my tragedies attired as widows shall walk on one side while my gaily vested comedies shall trip on the other   mr fancy and a musical band of catcalls shall walk between   mr phrensy base canvass dauber how dare you interrupt me when the poets eye was in a fine phrensy rolling when the muse was kindling with conception vile brushholder you do not know the mischief you have done you have made the muse miscarry the bright vision is lost for ever    exit mr phrensy lady b advancing now phrensy has finished his poetical rhapsody i beg i may present my congratulations to the bride and bridegroom i must confess to you mr fashion that i little thought the gay irregular comedy of your bachelor life would have terminated with so abrupt and moral a conclusion as for you my dear though i am not to call you sister you will always be the object of my tender solicitude   miss plin i am a giddy creature but i hope i shall never forfeit your protection i shall leave to others to pursue the varying modes and fopperies of the day this is the fashion pointing to fashion that i shall adopt and to this fashion i shall be ever constant   lord mel bravo matrimony inspires you well as it is now my turn to speak i beg you will both accept of my best wishes may happiness lead you through life along her most smooth and flowery path   miss plin well my lord since you take my tricking you in such perfect good humor when i am mistress of my fortune i will lend you whatever money you stand in need of   mr fash displeased lord melcourt does not want our money i presume   miss plin i hope to see your lordship at our house in the country i suppose mr fashion you have one somewhere   lord mel fashions country house i am afraid is little better than a castle in the air but till he has one erected upon a more solid foundation i entreat mr and mrs fashion will look upon melcourt hall as their own   miss plin egad this is handsome i have one thing more to recommend to your lordship   lord mel what are your commands   miss plin half aside be sure you never mention the crooked legs   lord mel depend upon my discretion  come let us all pass some cheerful days under this roof let reproaches and complainings cease let good humor social intercourse pleasantry and content succeed   end of the comedy epilogue by the right hon field marshal conway spoken by miss farren with gloomy bodings for his bantling play our author came to me the other day a boon to ask though half afraid to break it he would got an epilogue and i must speak it  all means he fain would try if not too late still to avert his dread impending fate sad visions too distract his anxious brain rumors of ills that wait the scribbling train it is said your taste for comedy is flown that darling child you once were proud to own that shakespeares fires no more your senses rouse congreve and vanbrugh seldom fill the house while childish pageants stuff the crowded scene no mortal even guessing what they mean fierce wars they wage and dreadful battles try with bloodless conflict all one knows not why till by the friendly banners we are told there macedons there persias chief behold just as on signs the informing words declare this the red lion that is the black bear queens and their maids of honor wait in vain till their mute lovers shall their suit explain they would often heard indeed from greece and rome that love was blind but never that he was dumb there too those motly female manly graces with almost all things naked but their faces those modern picts at whom we gaze with wonder while their keen falchions cut whole ranks asunder great rustyfustis triumphs thus we greet six holy roman emprors breathless at her feet nor less the neighboring temples of apollo with equal steps the bright example follow there beardless warriors squeak each others doom and silken vandals plan the fall of rome there demigods by entrechats advance and carthage flames demolished in a dance arms clash loud thunders roar and chariots rattle while jarring trumpets animate the battle now critics if youre angry think on these and spare the bard who strives at least to please judge and be judged in anger just i pray audire alteram partem is fair play in such a cause although the task be hard i will be myself of counsel for our bard i have such authorities as none refuses fletas and cokes and blackstones of the muses farqhuar and row and wycherly we boast and avons mighty seer himself a host yet for i feel my female fears increase though armed for war yet still i wish for peace we own your power confess your wondrous sway whom all our great dramatic realms obey no merit we can claim till you befriend it wit is not wit unless your taste commend it from the authors anvil a mere sluggish mass your plaudits stamp the coin and bid it pass by your mild sentence then decide our fate far better to be good than to be great like britains monarch act your generous parts and fix your empire in our greatful hearts  finis
