the sky the widestretchd plain and mountain high but when the sun unveils his face the landscape glows with heightened grace should raging tempests heaven deform if final victor of the storm the same illustrious lord of day full blazes with triumphant ray all nature owns his influence bright and bends before the glorious light nursed by his warmth the latent grain with future harvests gilds the plain his power pervades the deeper mine and moulds the embryo gem to shine see youth exulting in his may what newborn joys before him play his sprightly feet expatiate round and all he sees is fairy ground when love unfolds his pinions nigh and wafts his soul to ecstasy say that adversity should bring her livid plagues her scorpion sting and the collected venom dart remorseless on the human heart love soothes to rest it is fiercest pain and gives it vital strength again each softer energy refined he kindles in the darkened mind and from their hidden seat calls forth the zealous deeds of generous worth thou pure enlightener of the breast oh shine through all my life confessed nor cease thy gentler warmth to shed in latest evening on my head there let thy beams still lingering fall till fates black gloom incloses all ii the truest love is most reserved and shy no look of confidence or boldness wears known by the humble brow and softened eye and full of wavering doubts and anxious fears when i perceived that thespia had overcome my yielding heart and fixed her empire there that from her voice i must receive my doom and all my future weal must flow from her how did my bosom fluctuate with the pain of native bashfulness and strong desire what varying conflicts did i not sustain how struggled soft respect with passions fire often did i wish the secret to have told but awe witheld and modest dread prevailed her presence all my faculties controlled and every settled resolution failed at length with firm intent i sought the fair with firm intent to pour out all my heart at once display the story of my care and the long misery of consuming smart to a sequestered grove her steps i drew she without guile went innocently free no ill suspecting for no ill she knew nor feared to trust herself alone with me at first my usual converse i assayed hoping from thence to gain a tranquil air and as along the winding paths we strayed with frequent blossoms decked her flowing hair but still my shortened breath fast went and came over my embarrassd limbs a stiffness hung my heart throbbd strong and shook my laboring frame and fears i know not how unnerved my tongue resolved to speak some secret power restrained ashamed and angry with myself i grew with crimson consciousness my cheeks were stained and quick again the conscious stains withdrew she whether unobservant all the while or else this strange confusion to relieve talks with her wonted ease and careless smile but brief and vague each answer which i give then changed my fickle will it is first design determined sudden on some future day then would i each perplexity untwine and every ardent wish before her lay a transient calm succeeded in my breast yet sure thought i they were not so concealed but she the emotions of my heart has guessed she too may happily wish they were revealed though now my faultering tongue its aid denies she must have read the language of my soul nor have i marked displeasure in her eyes when forth from mine the glance of love has stole then turning round in haste as if afraid lest diffidence again might intervene not daring to erect my timid head my hesitating lips disclosed my pain iii in nothing was i learned but only how to pen my flocks and drive them to the field in the strait furrow to direct my plough and when my hoe and pruninghook to wield uncultivated was my mind and mean my abject thoughts low fastened to the earth till love with hand benign brake customs chain and bade me soar beyond my humble birth with beauty fired i looked around and saw the charms of nature never seen before o love a willing vassal to thy law i bend i feel thy blessings and adore prompted by thee as yet with trembling tongue i called the muses and desired their aid my woodnotes in the hazel copse i sung and caught the attention of the listening maid she listened to my strains she heard my tale while deepening blushes over her cheeks arise the soft consenting sigh my lips inhale i see the yielding languor of her eyes no witness truth if ever i estrange this grateful heart which only beats for thee  why utter needless vows i cannot change fixed are my bonds nor will i ever be free fixed is thy gentle sway by thee my mind avarice and all its sordid acts disdains the common vice of passion unrefined the common vice among our country swains hence stinging cares hence grovelling they behold the state of riches with an envious eye they think not aught beyond the power of gold nor know how love can lift the soul on high oh come my fair one i have thatched above and whitened all around my little cot shorn are the hedges leading to the grove nor is the seat and willow bower forgot low is the path of life in which i move yet will thou not regret the higher sphere of wealth and noisy pride while faithful love and innocence and sweet content are here iv ah whence my thespia can that anguish flow that silent anguish of expressive woe that sigh which from thy struggling bosom stole that look which pierces to my inmost soul ah say my thespia i conjure thee say to me the hidden cause unblamed display half of thyself i claim my lawful share yet would to heaven that i the whole might bear unveil thy thoughts in confidence to me and trust a bosom fraught with sympathy from thee would i my laboring heart confine and are not all its deepest secrets thine wretch that i am am i who thee from pain to shield would pour out life at every vein am i the cause and could thou ever spy a look of coldness glancing from my eye to thee a cold blank look oh too refined and subtle error of thy feeling mind a delicacy apt too deep to dive to each nice touch too tenderly alive though i esteem it as a blessing sent as the more polished minds chief ornament a sacred spark kindled by heavens own ray yet let not sensibility betray thou weepst where did my tongue profanely rove how could i blame thee twas excess of love oh let me circle thee with strict embrace warm breast to breast and glowing face to face my fixed lips while speechless rapture ties imbibe the lucid moisture of thine eyes thy melting spirit in each breath inhale gaze on thee till the nerves of vision fail and quite oerpowerd by loves imperious sway feel all my fainting soul dissolve away v still blooming health thy modest graces shed over the clear surface of my thespias cheek there let thy fresh thy glowing tints be spread thy smiles enlightening and complacence meek protect her where she goes ye gentle powers pure denizons of undulating air whether from fervid noontides sultry hours or evenings dewy shades protect the fair it is true my thespia i indeed confess that selfish are the prayers and vows i pay with no disinterested voice i bless the gods or pour the supplicating lay for ah from thee and from thy looks i find warm to my heart each cordial joy must flow sweetening the ills of life from thee my mind must taste it is keenest sense of piercing woe thine is the masterkey each spring to rule each hidden movement of my secret thought sure thou were bred in some enchanters school who all his spells and mystic charms has taught yet then would holy truth with thee reside truth which unbounded confidence my trust yet then would mean deceit fly far aside and wild caprice confounding false and just would thou have said as i struck dumb with fear tremblingly pointed out my humble bower happily tranquillity and peace are there for them i scorn the gaudy farce of power o thou sincerest how shall i repay the endless debt of gratitude i owe quickly my fair point out to me the way and show the path for thou alone can show though silent is thy tongue thy speaking eye the modest blushes over thy cheeks which rove that deepdrawn breath that panting breast reply the sole return is tenderness and love will this suffice and do thou ask no more what the spontaneous feelings needs must give oh let me lavish on thee all my store nor cease to love thee till i cease to live for ever rivetted within my heart thy dear unsullied image shall remain when from that seat i bid it to depart may i by some tremendous stroke be slain no common death i shall deserve to die to pine by inches on a barren strand scorched by the vengeful suns severest eye nor by one sportive wandering zephyr fanned to freeze on some bleak rock to glut the rage of howling beasts within the dreary waste or live in youth despised in helpless age the extremities of want and woe to taste to walk a moving plague among mankind shunned hated and refused the alms i crave refused despairs last only wish to find a still retirement in the peaceful grave in that fond hope to be deceived to hear with soul yet conscious in the churchyard way the fierce invective cast upon my bier and scornful laughter dancing over my clay all this and more i shall deserve to prove when led by changeful fancys wanton eye i turn a faithless truant to thy love and on the wings of vagrant falsehood fly vi shall the fair form of smiling love no more sport over the lawn with freedom by his side diffusing blessings from his ample store on the fond bridegroom and the happy bride who led by choice and inclinations fire breathing delicious sympathy of soul to the thick shady nuptial bower retire attempering rapture warm with chaste control for such of yore to grace their marriage day the flocks exulting danced with nimbler tread the tribes aerial tuned their softest lay and earths green lap with fresher flowers was spread then were the laws of avarice held in scorn now unopposed and absolute her reign if happily two with nobler souls are born the gloomy clouds of malice intervene o error fond to think that wealth bestows our only bliss say blushing grandeur say whether thy breast that heartfelt pleasure knows which gilds the shade of lifes sequestered way say in the morning do thou cheerlier rise or were thy slumbers sweeter in the night does natures noontide luster strike thine eyes or evenings milder beam with more delight art thou not tortured with desire of fame smarts not thy soul with envys secret goad and do not conscious honor generous shame and tender love fly thy unblest abode ye purest virtues wheresoeer i rove and thou lastnamed most valued of the three whom language fails to praise celestial love never shall your laws be unobserved by me and wilt not thou my thespia own their power shall not their guardian care on thee attend and teach thee in reflections silent hour to cast a thought upon thy more than friend on him whose heart with truest ardour beats whose zeal nor time nor absence shall assuage blooming unsullied by youths scorching heats and undecaying in the frost of age lasting as life for not the vagrant beams of wanton fancy raised a sudden fire no spark of passion whose extatic dreams vivid and gay in quick disgust expire not that with cool and philosophic eye not that with unenraptured mind i view beautys alluring grace her vermeil die her winning smiles and loveinspiring hue but bearing friendships unsuspected seal into thy presence frequently i stole young artless innocence removed the veil and showed in all it is charms thy spotless soul i gazed enamored every virtue bright in that pure temple each ethereal form stood visible before my mental sight and my breast throbbd with holy transport warm can i the shrine forsake while constant truth while filial pietys engaging deed goodnature loveliest crown of smiling youth and pity meek forbid me to recede what feelings then can tempt me to betray the rights of love what interest not my own for thou to me art fortunes prosperous ray from thee exiled how dreadful is her frown the mind which claims our passions to control why is it not allknowing and allwise to pierce the deep recesses of the soul and see the bounds where sense and errors lies then would not beauty ever be sold and bought from thy embrace i should not then be torn condemned should thou  but treasons in that thought to curse the fatal hour when i was born no far be pale suspicion i detest the haggard fiend hushed then be every fear my hopes i treasure up within thy breast and oh i charge thee keep them sacred there vii yes far my gentle maid from thee and every haunt of joy i stray shall not thy wishes go with me to cheer my faint and lonely way shall not within thy faithful breast remembrance it is sweet blossoms bear shall not it is plant by thee carest take root and bloom unfaded there will thou not often steal unseen through dewy field and trackless plain or utter to the copses green thy soft and melancholy strain though fate has torn the bond of love will thou not often cast thine eye to where expelled and sad i rove and breathe a tender pitying sigh be witness conscious heaven my soul shall never a thought of thee resign no power it is fervor can control unchanged and stamped for ever shine yet though by mutual faith assured what racking torment thus to part what bleeding woe must be endured what anguish must distract the heart viii was it a dignity of shape an eye or face instinct with beautys dazzling ray whose power at once bade vanquished reason fly and swiftly stole me from myself away had that been all though strong had been my grief not to have won the object of my care time would with lenient hand have brought relief the cure another equally as fair but though a thousand now i should behold and own them fairer than the maid i love my heart to all their beauties would be cold no charms my former passion could remove for youthful prepossession knit the tie which our consenting hearts together drew with years the pleasing partiality and soft attractive impulse firmer grew fancy meantime unnumberd visions spread in which no seas were rough no tempests lourd we saw our hopes with ecstasy we fed and in each others bosom fondly poured and can i with these loved ideas part can i this dear dear sympathy forego first from their place the strings of life shall start and the warm ruddy drops forget to flow of thee bereft  oh twere the worst of ills  deep penetrates the thought with sore annoy my shuddering heart my inmost soul it chills and blasts each future scene of rising joy of thee bereft  it shall not cannot be  spite of the wayward accidents of life yet once again our actions shall be free and oh my love o dearer name my wife again shall i infold thee in my arms and breathe my soul into thy faithful breast the oerpast evil with fresh transport warms the pangs of absence make us doubly blessed ix i was not formed for glorys arduous ways the hidden depths of science to explain to cloathe me in ambitions golden rays or combat death and tread the carnaged plain in the broad open face of public life to some heaven gives conspicuously to move enamored of the scenes of noise and strife to me a mind all indolence and love unhappiness and care to kings i give exposed they stand to every stormy gale on yonder hills green side secure i live or walk with vacant step along the dale enough for me to meet my thespia there arm locked in arm along the wood to roam lost but to love to stray we know not where and wonder how we got so far from home for her the hedgeflower garland to intwine at her command invoke the artless muse press close her chaste her glowing cheek to mine or on her breast all my whole soul effuse my thoughts to more extatic pleasures rise here sacred wedlock bring thy closest veil and from the busy ken of prying eyes thy holy rites and mysteries conceal such were the strains which in the jocund prime of life when fancy takes delight to dream i sung nor spent a thought on future time where rural alphin winds his scanty stream i sung each object struck me with delight the edying rivulet the newshorn flock the meads with flowers of various hue bedight the verdant hillock and the barren rock yet thoby kindest nature formed to stray the sweet oblivious path of life along fates tyrant voice and unrelenting sway impells the novice mid the bustling throng i go yet once more let me cast my eyes on you ye wellknown scenes a parting view though i with fondest estimation prize your longfrequented haunts for aye adieu but oh my thespia  there the imperfect sound hangs unpronounced upon my trembling tongue cold damps of dewy sweat my brow surround and every nerve and sinew is unstrung once more receive me to thy panting breast would i could rivet me forever there such agonies no language ever expressed death cannot bring a torture so severe x what have i done what crime in me is found what secret evil lurking in my breast that while all nature else is smiling round heaven has on me it is heaviest stroke impressed have i ever dropped a wish of others harm or done an ill though never to be revealed have i not always breathed the emotion warm on the chaste lip of social virtue sealed ah is it not enough that far away from my own native happy fields i rove far from each friendly name condemned to stray and torn by cruel force from her i love but must through her the barbed steel be sent which piercing with severest torture wounds shall she i love convey the punishment which justice must confess exceeds its bounds on me rain all your woes ye righteous powers though hard i will strive the misery to bear view sickness steal away my lingering hours on tainted wing nor drop a pining tear but ah the gentle virgins tender frame  o brighthaird chastity o angel truth if ye are aught beyond an empty name save save in pity innocence and youth shield shield me from the racking thought i spy from her cold cheek the bland suffusion fled dead is the piercing magic of her eye the lustredarting beam of sense is dead she calls on me  oh snatch the last embrace woods rivers mountains countries intervene oh curse of curses never that lovely face again shall i behold even the last scene some dreary satisfaction might afford some solace to the madness of despair gloating in secret on his gloomy hoard with eye intorted viewing what is there xi ah can they be of gentle woman born are they not rather cast in iron mould who love as if it were a weakness scorn and place their sum of happiness in gold who nothing of that sweet alliance know that tender union of connected hearts whence only transports unalloyd can flow transports which brave afflictions venomed darts o genuine offspring of the native soul as yet unfashiond by the hand of vice ye thoughts which point the way to honors goal ye thoughts whence every virtue takes its rise ye warm inspirers of the breast of youth ye handmaids which compose the smiling train of innocence and unsuspecting truth say were ye formed so wondrous fair in vain did nature plant you in the human mind that tyrant art might thence her work displace that your free limbs might be in chains confined that hardened interest might your charms deface ah no far otherwise her equal law and kind maternal tenderness decreed she willed her infant scyons there to grow to bloom and ripen into golden seed hence gave she all that more than eloquence which speaks in virgin beautys bashful eye hence left the soul of youth without defense glowing with warm susceptibility hence panting wishes undissembled fears her ardent votaries felt hence fancy wild and love sincere and vows unfeigned were theirs and awe shrunk back and hope the cherub smiled o thespia we these ardent votaries were have i not fixed my fainting sight on thee till trickling down my cheek the emphatic tear has in mute language told my ecstasy while from thy conscious but more timid eye the downcast rays thy secret flame confessed while the quickvarying blush and struggling sigh disclosed the pure emotions of thy breast how roves the vagrant mind to future days how credulous is love with magic wand what visions cannot soothing error raise how thick around the selfdelusions stand duped by their flattery natures just design we saw with us to it is perfection brought saw each acceding year more firmly twine the mental wreathe our younger fancies wrought they painted to our view the lowly cot where neatness bland with meek contentment played looked up to heaven and blessed their tranquil lot nor envied guilt in glaring pride arrayed with treacherous smile the farm retired they showed it is verdant meads it is fields and sylvan bowers the grazing lambs the waving corn the wood of tufted elm and garden decked with flowers obscure the scenes their pleasing pencil drew obscure but blessed with unaffected joy we hated mad ambitions noisy crew convinced that love with reason could not cloy our rural neighbors to the friendly feast we bid their simple hearts intent to gain where pride inspires not the fastidious breast envy will seek to wound it is peace in vain false though enchanting prospects yet no fault no crime of ours has rendered them untrue but hide the cause  check every murmuring thought  to virtue this sad sacrifice is due yet let me curse stern avarice odious fiend let me lament the unhappiest of their kind all other passions dead compelled to bend beneath this last slow fever of the mind rather than feel this dire distempers sway than with this thirst be scorched in lifes decline may i never see again the cheerful day fo ever doomed to labor in the mine may every terror fate reserves in store for wretched man assault this drooping head may want may famine enter at my door may pain and restless care surround my bed or should my thespia all our trials past should we before the sacred altar stand may heaven in mercy with the lightnings blast strike me at once and tear the destined band xii why was i born in this more polished clime amid the scenes of artificial life where custom rules longsanctified by time and fashion holds with nature endless strife a thousand wants start up a thousand fears to shackle love or interrupt his course he struggles yet the galling burden bears sighs with regret but owns their sovereign force eager to follow where the emotions lead hides every wish by violence suppressed gazes with ardour on the blooming maid but dreads the future anguish of her breast our liberty we boast on britains shore yet slaves to gold it is tyrant power obey our vices spring from it is creative ore and even our virtues feel it is quickening ray perils and crimes we scruple not to dare or act the meanest part intent on gold yet may the soul refused it is gifts to share with conscious pride sublimer traits unfold hence generous youth with riches unendowd the mistress of his bosom scorns to gain grief may advance affliction threaten loud firm he supports the accumulated pain happy the freeborn hunters of the wild their only art how best to urge the chase no thoughts of wealth their passions ever beguiled no rank they claim for equal is the race they suffer not the torments of desire they are not doomed to pour the fruitless tear to combat with the strong the tender fire and pine from month to month from year to year happy the natives of more southern skies with softer manners softer forms endued where all around spontaneous harvests rise where from each tree depends ambrosial food of cruel bonds they utter no complaint the gentle virgin hears his amorous tale smiles on her favored youth without restraint and crowns his wishes in the spicy vale just are thy words my thespia  what delight could passive brutal ignorance impart disgust at once would rise before my sight my heart would loathe the unsympathising heart nor could i to the joys of sense resigned the sportive wanton to my bosom press forget the pure desire the will refined the exalted sentiment and chaste caress a single glance from virtues melting eye the soul with more extatic pleasure warms a blush of innocence one pitying sigh transcends all luxurys prostituted charms still let us cherish hope whatever befalls and see where reason wisdom take their stand drive the fierce passions from their hallowed walls and lead cherubic patience by the hand say that entangled in the social chain wants fears and griefs intrude a numerous crew though more dilated flows the stream of pain the source of pleasure is augmented too just are thy words  but when the present ill afflicts this curious web we idly twine nature and passion are victorious still overwhelmed is my philosophy and thine xiii dear anxious maid whose apprehensive love has formed of tender fears a numerous train these looks of fond solicitude remove fled is the gloomy progeny of pain fled is each sullen image from my mind over its corporeal yokemate brooding dull the thoughts of thee alone are left behind of thee in every part my soul is full warm to my breast the vital spirits flow kindle anew each strong affection there the mutual ardour corresponding glow and grateful tumult which i scarce can bear such as i feel when from thy speaking eye dart unrestrained the beams of melting love while meek sincerity stands smiling by and innocence displays her wings above such as i feel when to myself i vow the sacred trust inviolably sure guarded by steady faith which scorns to bow whose ties the purest energies secure reserve and distant coyness tutored arts let these be goads to vitiated desire natures true colors charm untainted hearts love begets love creates and feeds the fire ambitions sons who climb her airy way what feelings can you boast compared with mine on you content never shed her tranquil ray though in the external glare of pomp you shine this eve more real joy my breast inspired than you can in a thousand ages know joy which reflection can behold untired amid whose blooms no thorns of anguish grow thou too reflect unblamed my darling fair and pleasure in thy generous heart be found thy confidence meets confidence sincere thy truth with undissembled truth is crowned this night may sleep unfold his gentlest wing the softest plume upon thy eyelids lay delightful be thy dreams as laughing spring enchanting as the firstborn gales of may ye level meads ye winding streams be seen your fringed sides with bending osiers graced let us exulting tread your margin green mix the warm sigh embrace and be embraced impart the secret dictates of our soul the wish the passion unreserved and free conscious that equal choice can never control that perfect love is perfect liberty xiv it is not strange that in my thespias eye amaze and anger should appear when told that gentle doris had without a sigh resigned her charms to age for worthless gold in all her features delicacy reigned what bright transparent tints her cheeks overspread the snow beneath as it that veil disdained with softest swell seemed vanquishing the red mild were her glances as the ray of eve when the lark sits and meditates his flight her voice might anguish of it is sting bereave or smoothe like philomel the frowns of night her sentiments proclaimed a spotless heart where dwelt the nicest sense of praise and shame natures disciple undisguised by art she seemed as born for loves and friendships flame no wonder thou my thespia should the tale astonished hear more skilled in humankind versed in their failings i myself turned pale such youth such beauty such deceit to find thou see how avarice may her serpent face amid the flowers of female sweetness hide how thinking we behold each female grace we view the complicated mask of pride hapless who thus around loves soaring wing can bind the glittering ignominious chain stop natures current taint her limpid spring and prostitute through choice their souls for gain on these who boast a womans form alone let not my thespia waste a single thought here is be the robe of honor virtues zone and fame and generous love and charms unbought should youth the most adorned with wealth combine my soul at ease would not a rival dread for constancy has fixed with rosy twine the neverfading chaplet on her head should fate a decent competence supply redundant treasure would her be given should it while love was granted that deny for it is best gift her thanks would rise to heaven the mean my fair and abject of thy sex yield not the faintest light to judge of thee my settled faith no jarring doubts perplex thy hopes thy fears are centered all in me even beneath povertys incumbent load our hearts would glow with unextinguishd fire while we together trod the uneven road a groan would not be heard a sigh transpire should i be doomed anothers flock to tend without regret the change i see thee bear to dutys humblest step serene descend my love the full reward of every care with what reluctance at the break of day bid we adieu how often reverts my sight how do we chide the tardy suns delay and with what rapture hail the approach of night while temperance pleased surveys our homely fare our slender beverage while content supplies let festive luxury cull her viands rare grateful we sit and uninvidious rise then ever with fondness we retire to rest conversing bland lifes mingled scenes we view from these delight gaybeaming warms our breast and those impearl our cheeks with pitys dew or not forsaken by the tuneful nine with sweetest descant i the time beguile mark how my thespias eyes with transport shine nor covet aught but her approving smile the rural matron and the greyhaird sire devoutly wish their childrens lot the same thy prudence meekness neatness of attire my industry and love their precepts frame oh thespia not the wealth of worlds could buy from thee a link of our soulbracing chain and should affliction should misfortune try to break it is union they would strive in vain thou know to value love how incomplete without his aid how small is pleasures store without his aid how wretched are the great favored by him what joys may bless the poor xv hence rash belief may thy wild thoughts again never through the cells of busy fancy rove oblivion snatch their memory from my brain nor leave a thought injurious to my love but ever thus in your most pleasing dress ye dear ideas crowd upon my soul there each rejoicing avenue possess and fill with ecstasy the vital goal place her as now before my mental eye the sweet unrivaled spotless tender fair pure as the fleecy whiteness of the sky gentle as breezes mild of vernal air can thou not guess what torments seized my heart for each soft passion nicer sense is thine how through each nerve swift ran the venomed smart when my eyes glanced along the dubious line not for the eastern tyrants gorgeous robe for all the slaves that at his feet have knelt not for the wealth of all this ample globe would i ever feel again what then i felt reflection was overwhelmed it is power was lost upon my brow a cold damp vapor hung my brain a thousand vague ideas crossed made by heart sick and chained my palsied tongue striving to read my eyes their task refused again i strove and forced their straining gaze i thought  yet could not think i was abused  i wished  but all was darkness and amaze then all that i had read or heard or knew of womens guile and how with arts they blind unguarded man to true love most untrue rushed headlong in and harrowd up my mind can i this want of confidence forgive to me who would for her through sultry climes through frozen seas have passed not whilst i live it is treason perfidy the worst of crimes to cast a shade over infamy of vice the bosom friend to fix the mutual seal surely herself will never be overnice who could anothers shame so well conceal why did she beg the paper from my hand but that it proves her conduct base and light with trembling earnestness behind me stand then haste away to shun my piercing sight it cannot be  some cursed mistake is here  yet still that womans life confirms the deed why doubt too true alas the grounds of fear if true my wounded heart must ever bleed these a few thoughts from out the many were which through my mind with fervid motion rolled disorder contradiction dread was there and hope quick yielding to suspicion bold lo i approach thy presence  while my knees can scarce support their tottering weight along my cheeks now glow now on a sudden freeze now pauses my weak heart now vibrates strong thy hand i pressed but did not as before feel thrilling pleasure harmonize my frame that magic touch alas prevailed no more emotions rose which now i blush to name then first with illdissembled tenderness i wrapped thy soft confusion in my arms no accents were prepared thy ears to bless my soul was firmly closed against thy charms yet did i pity thee yes witness heaven compassion viewed thee though i could not love i saw thee from my bleeding bosom riven and sunk below me while i soared above yes i looked down with pity on thy state as on a cherub whom i once admired i loved thee not and yet i could not hate mourned thee guiltspotted but no more desired with hesitation my reproach began what rapturous pleasure did thy answer bear superior joy never bathed the soul of man from the pure stream of bliss and fount sincere ah fool who would not rather have divined likeness of names  could i with mean disgrace thus taint that inborn rectitude of mind disclosed in each bright feature of thy face could i thus stamp with guilt sensations sprung from thought most delicate which shrinks afraid from the rude breath of censure from the tongue ungenerous daring without cause upbraid oh for the honor of thy sex and thee still be it mine my darling fair to err never may thy gentle graces veil to me be innocence thy genuine character but be it thine to pardon to display thy meekness frankness so shall ardent love though dimmed awhile shine with intenser ray and even time it is steadier warmth improve xvi o my souls only joy my promised wife for whom i breathe for whom the stream of life swift courses through my veins thou generous maid by truth and young sincerity arrayed in unsuspecting honor nobly free placing the excess of confidence in me who heedless of the insipid prudish art ownst all the genuine dictates of thy heart from me no word no action shall thou find to soil thy innate loveliness of mind from me thy innocence has naught to fear to me be still unboundedly sincere still gaze on me with loves complacent eye still give me tear for tear and sigh for sigh in my fond bosom hide thy blushing face be more than passive still to my embrace dearest of women oh without control indulge these finest movements of the soul my breast is not with vulgar passion fraught i glory in my dignity of thought it is true i feel within the kindling fire i feel the maddning anguish of desire the agonizing joy the rapturous pain goads each idea of my swimming brain yet this though sympathising thou appear to faintness and to sickness can i bear nay even to death itself ever thou shall see a deed unworthy of myself and thee xvii happy the few who in retirement find those sweet delights which shun tumultuous noise who feast on pleasures suited to their mind and barter idle show for solid joys far from the city and it is revelers gay to shades and bubbling springs love takes his flight he hates the scenes of their fantastic day and longprotracted vigils of their night in crowded towns how rarely virtue dwells how seldom is the genuine muse carest they range the untainted lawns and rural dells adorn the maid or fire her shepherds breast and are we doomed to this abhorred abode forbid again to breathe serener air to stray as erst along the secret road untrod by vice by vanity and care here avarice sits there bursting reasons mound impertinence rolls on her giddy tide with thoughtless mirth the lofty domes resound the streets reflect the garish rays of pride should we a moment wish the din to cease would i my thespia frame the soothing lay some worthless visitors disturb our peace and force the alluring images away friendship their idle bosoms never graced not to it is finer voice their nerves are strung scandal and folly regulate their taste and prompt the quick vibrations of their tongue who bred in cities view the lovely beam fresh darted from the morns expanding eye till noon the fair indulge their slothful dream wake to complain and breathe the languid sigh the important hours are then resigned to dress the fancied form of elegance is near but she

vice xix from the first hour when i beheld the light no time compared with this have i surveyed no day ever rose with luster half so bright no minutes shone in plumes so fair arrayed at length adversity has spent her store or with false aim her poisoned arrows fly our spirits long deprest again can soar no tears but those of bliss shall wet our eye o my beloved this day shall ever stand with me the golden period of the year this day good fortune waved her potent wand dispersing all the mists of doubt and fear never may they rise again our joys between ye unexpected ties propitious prove fairer and brighter still be every scene portrayed by tenderness illumed by love xx this elegy is principally imitated from the first of tibullus  let some heap wealth with neverceasing pain try every art and brave all ills for gain let others toil in war whom glory charms their slumbers broken by the din of arms me neither emulous of pomp or praise choice to a life of indolence betrays nor small the pleasure which the country yields it is rills untainted and innoxious fields now from the incircling weed the plant i free now shake the ripened apple from the tree my thriving nursery view or lands which bear the frugal portion of the future year in hope my sheaves arranged with skill survey or homeward borne and safely piled away i blush not in my hardy palm to take the sharpened sickle or collecting rake to turn the furrow in the loosened plain and throw with liberal hand the yellow grain or when unheeded by it is careless dam to foster by my fire a tender lamb this is the place where life with joy is spent these are the haunts which cherish sweet content oh when a vacant interspace i find to tread the paths myself have taught to wind where the trim hedgerows neatly pleachd around defend my farm and circumscribe it is bound to break my fence and ramble void of car across the hills and dales i know not where how struck with awe or pleasure should my eye a blasted oak unseen before espy or my ear catch the song of rustic hind borne on the pinions of the breathing wind though slender are my means nor large my store yet not unhospitable is my door often shall my honest neighbors enter there and own that though not rich i am sincere there helpless age shall gain some small supply nor lift in vain the supplicating eye oh may my fields the bursting torrent spare nor sweep away the produce of the year oh wholesome be the gales which over them blow so shall my grazing flock no taintworm know so shall my healthy oxen draw the plough my kine with welldistended udders low be to my humble prayer propitious heaven nor thus make less the little thou have given that little is enough with that i am blessed and feel each wish abundantly possessed yes it is enough what luxury never knows each eve i steep my limbs in calm repose should i awake how pleased to lie and hear the raging winds without assail my ear and should my thespia at the tempest start to strain the trembling fair one to my heart or when the wintry rain descends in streams then to be buried in elysian dreams this be my lot let him be rich for me who dares the terrors of the uncertain sea the pointed rocks and hidden quicksands braves and all the fury of the winds and waves this be my lot content shall league with health nor give one anxious thought to pride or wealth my luxury the summers fervid sun in some oerarching cave or grove to shun seek the deepshaded stream which steals along and pour my unpremeditated song when winter drives my cattle to the fold and the shrunk ether is benumbed with cold to heap the crackling fuel and at ease enjoy the spreading luster of the blaze or bid my distant household train draw nigh and catch the pleasure beaming from their eye riches i give them to the wind  to me they shine unnoticed and my fair to thee riches again i give you to the wind  say can you add one pleasure to the mind root out the everwithering branch of care or plant one vegetative virtue there widestraying fancy whither do thou rove o thespia all these thoughts i owe to love from thee they spring by thee my breast was fired and reason sanctifies what love inspired had not thy wishes breathed an humble life i might perhaps with base diseases rife have joined the sordid throng  have dogged the train of abject pride and clankd my golden chain now do i know to live my thespia now to live indeed for thou have taught me how for thee my love no toil would i disdain but vie in labor with the meanest swain my oxen join when day begins to peep or on the lonely mountain feed my sheep and while my arms thy gentle form surround enjoy soft slumbers on the rugged ground who on the embroidered couch would wish to lie if scornful love expand his sleepless eye ah wretch soft melodys enchanting strain the downy pillow tempts repose in vain let vanity in empty show delight to glitter in the gazers wondering sight let proud ambition to the court repair there the mean brow of servile flattery wear cringe to some worthless pander every hour creep on the dirty ground to rise to power let avarice looking on his tumid store exulting lift his head and curse the poor thou fillst my every wish and while the fire of life shall burn no other shall transpire even at the last thou still my sight shall bless and my weak hand shall strive thy hand to press how will thou mourn and droop thy pensive head when on my bed of death i shall be laid yes thou will mourn my pale cold limbs embrace and bathe with ineffectual tears my face thou have no flinty heart which cannot feel thy bosom is not braced with chains of steel with streaming eyes see me inhumed in clay nor force shall tear thee from my grave away yet oh thy cheeks at that dread moment spare nor rend the flowing tresses of thy hair though torn from thee by deaths relentless will my conscious soul shall fondly view thee still meantime let love be ours too soon will spread the sable cloud round each devoted head too soon old age steals on whose frosted hair forbids the genial blandishments to share now let the fugitive be ours for now on our flushed cheeks sits well his fervent glow now it becomes to mix the endearing scene and scatter sweet protervity between far be the bustling world it is trivial joys it is fame it is wealth it is honors i despise xxi has the flaming car of day rolled it is annual course away since my thespia to my arms yielded first her virgin charms since the meeklyblushing fair whispered softly in my ear anxious grief and doubt are flown take me i am all thy own yes the rapid hours are past fled with more than winged haste swift indeed is pleasures tread swift ye hours of joy ye fled everenchanting evernew still with fondest look i view the gentle beams which from thy heart through thy eyes expressive dart still i feel a lovers fire tenderest thoughts and warm desire the bridal graces round thee play young unconscious of decay hence reproach and satire vain fools may feel the galling chain freedom for us the garland wove connecting hymen close with love does possession render less the sweet zest of happiness how with pity we behold the grovelling soul and slaves of gold xxii i call no virgin of the nine i bend not low at fancys shrine to truth alone these strains belong she guides my pen and prompts my song o thespia time which can control the wilder fervours of the soul before whom falsehood stands confessed of frailty the decisive test has while the stillprogressive year surrounded twice the solar sphere added new strength to tender love the passion nicer spirits prove has tried thy soul and found it right has brought new graces forth to light discovered beauties in the wife which could not bloom in single life how poor is wealth how low is power compared with thy superior dower thine are the charms of innocence of unaffected native sense from that springs chaste and humorous mirth and this to decency gives birth the band without whose modest tie mirth is unmeaning revelry thine is compassions breath sincere her gentle sigh and generous tear prudential caution artless ease that sweet solicitude to please which never fails my soul to bless and renders every trouble less let fortune frown let friendship fade disown the promises it made let flattery cringe her baits display and leagued with selfish fraud betray whatever winds across my course blow adverse and whatever their force thou still shall soothe my ruffled breast with thee peace builds her halcyon nest thou will contents pure joys impart and calm serenity of heart i hate no more by thee refined but only wonder at mankind and though i know my prayer is vain and they are fettered by the chain of folly malice pride and pelf wish they were happy as myself xxiii there are who think mankind are born to rove by nature vagrant as the uncertain gale who laugh at vows of constancy and love as dreams of fancy or a dotards tale to these my thespia silence is the best the only answer can be justly given let them enjoy their dull unmeaning jest can creeping mists pollute the face of heaven they know not real love nor ever knew and bent on vulgar scenes of low delight can never virtues genuine beauties view or the true ray of pleasure mildly bright in fashions bowers they flit their little day and eager from their souls to banish thought to idle dissipation homage pay and giddy drink her variousmingled draught for them let secret pity drop a tear and nobly conscious of sublimer joys selfsatisfied her happier fortune bear and leave to change and vanity their toys conscious the darling object never can tire true love to each external good is blind fixed is the wavering pinion of desire thought answers thought and mind embraces mind who think like us like us who love to those can wealth or power an added pleasure give their tender sympathy still stronger grows till memory dies their warm affections live them do their smiling progeny amuse the infant race their mutual cares employ this gift should wisest providence refuse they in each other center every joy not accident or time can ever divide the attractive firm indissoluble chain the band which cordial amity has tied no power but death itself can break in twain xxiv london february      here mid the giddy and the vain i rove in cheerless solitude nor taste of joy my mind retreats to those dear scenes of love those scenes where pleasure reigns without alloy unsatisfied from gayety i turn what charms has luxury or pride for me methinks i view departed virtues urn and sorrowing fix my longing thoughts on thee on thee her living image in whose soul dwells every grace which harmonizes life which gilds with bliss the moments as they roll and makes me venerate the name of wife here mid the crowd unknowing and unknown i pass in gloomy sullenness along each entertainment now is odious grown the dance insipid tiresome is the song ah i perceive that naught on earth can please when wanting thee sole object of delight thy eyes emit their soft expressive rays and pleasure smiles enamored at the sight alone i bear a dull and lifeless load my thoughts are moping comfortless and cold thy presence is the warm inciting goad which cheers each sense and renders fancy bold how wretched they who in the mazy round of idle fashion urge their fruitless chase who every tender sentiment confound and natures laws submit to folly base here every hour the idiot train i spy the busy fluttering gay unthinking crew in every place they meet the sated eye and wanton license sickens at the view they know my love no happiness serene though in the wild pursuit their lives are spent they die unconscious of the soothing strain which charms the listening ear of sweet content mistaken fair ones idle thoughtless tribe victims to vice to vanity and play  say could the world and all its riches bribe thy nobler heart my thespia thus to stray thus to abandon the domestic scene where gentlest peace forever waves her wing where honor virtue mild affection reign and hymen wears the eternal vest of spring no never thou incircled in my arms ownst every wish and every joy complete while i with rapture gazing on thy charms despise the mean ambition of the great ye sluggish hours haste haste more swift away that i may fly to all my soul holds dear thy banner chaste connubial love display and guide me safely to her breast sincere xxv ye nymphs who tend each blooming grove of shady hants receive my fair oh heed the entreating voice of love and guard her with peculiar care a worthier guest ye never knew never hailed a soul of more unspotted hue if thus my thespia tread the plain a favorite of the sylvan powers or in the friendly dome remain where glide lifes pure unruffled hours say will not her reflecting mind often trace the pleasing scenes she left behind it will awhile herself she cheats and thinks the distant vision near with newraised joy her bosom beats but soon it fades and melts in air wishing the real scenes to spy with downcast look she checks the tender sigh from my own thoughts i judge of thine the same illusions float around but ah too quickly i resign the ideal form the ideal sound thy graces like the meteors ray thy voice like feeble echos dies away on iscas margin green i rove or hurry tward the rural cot but unobserved by social love the varied landscape charms me not only by thee attractive made decked with it is beauteous tints of light and shade oh come thou wanderer pleasures beam now setting shall again arise with love united pour it is stream of radiance and adorn the skies come gentle wanderer to my heart return return my souls far dearer part xxvi now issuing from his northern reign stern winter rushes over the plain and proudly boasts his power the genius of the forest sighs while pensive nature shivering lies beneath her leafless bower who thespia shall the season cheer relax the rigor of the year and even in winters arms bid fancy place gayblooming spring and frolic zephyr wave his wing in homage to her charms ah who but love within the breast by his enchanting influence blessed perennial roses grow ethereal mildness harbors there no furious storms or nipping air his sweet enthusiasts know they view wellpleased a different clime to them a different date of time another sun belongs while allunseen by vulgar eye ten thousand plumed pleasures fly and chaunt their vernal songs if happily human passions swell and shake awhile their peaceful cell they strive with idle force soon mutual fondness in her chains the momentary blasts restrains and smiling checks their course soon as before the lillies bloom again the roses breathe perfume and fresher colors spread again the pleasures wave their wing again their warbled transports sing around the nuptial bed o thespia days and years pass by the varying seasons we espy to us no change is known with us perpetual verdure blows for us with constant beauty glows a season of our own xxvii say can the muse with all her magic power though every grace attends her fairy train though she has culled each bloom which decks the bower of elegance to ornament her strain can she the soul of hymeneal love can she its tender sympathies pourtray while harmony expands her wings above and passion yields to friendships steadier ray ah no it is here is the suffering lovers tears his feverish hopes and wild desires to paint his giddy transports jealous doubts and fears but who can trace the charms of full content the soft complacence of the conscious heart mocks the rude touches of poetic art xxviii though i have broke by force the dazzling spell no longer by its bright illusions swayed though plunged in action i have bid farewell to soothing fancy to each tuneful maid yet at thy call i take a transient view and for a moment seek the muses shrine freshblooming chaplets on their altar strew to their enchantments deaf but ruled by thine yes witness nuptial love no other power could now evoke the longforgotten strain with glancing sunbeam cheer the clouded hour and urge me to their roseate paths again with thee i trace each lawn each meadow green thy voice is that of reason science truth with thee i visit each ideal scene the rapturebreathing haunts of early youth wellpleased the son of venus i behold wellpleased behold him aim his thrilling dart and generous ardour scorning sordid gold and faith ingenuous linking heart to heart and adverse fate prepared to break the tie but idlystriving with malicious hand and perseverance with intrepid eye and hope gaywaving her ethereal wand and hymen with a fragrant garland crowned by the soft fingers of the graces wove scattering profuse a thousand blessings round and holding converse sweet with smiling love with smiling love still converse sweet he holds to no ideal scenes we need repair the muses hallowed shrine his wing infolds and the bard offers his just homage there his be the chaplets his the votive lay let others dwell on thoughts of past delight he gilds the beams of this auspicious day and sheds over all the fane his influence bright this morn to gratulate for many a year may i with joy awake the slumbering lyre my numbers which to thespia first were dear will at her bidding reassume their fire i ask not fame misjudging crowd begone the muse ye vilify sings not for you she sings for thespia and from her alone expects the palm to constant passion due xxix bath december  0      ye nymphs who over these mystic springs preside which the laborious search of art deride by whom alone is traced their winding course who know each seed impregnating their source and whether chymic heat or real flame preserves their warmth through countless years the same great is your virtue and with praises due hygeia often has tuned the lyre to you but oh ye chastebreathd harmonies whose sway and gentle impulse minds select obey who in the softer purer heart reside each thought refine and each emotion guide who from that seat expel intruding care and bid serene complacence harbor there bid patience spread her wing ethereal guest and charm the sullen passious into rest without your aid how vain the boasted waves would issue from their subterraneous caves in vain the nymphs would cause them still to flow steam in the bath or in the crystal glow say then my thespia shall not i eerlong the blueeyd sisters hail with grateful song who to these streams no doubt inspired by heaven such matchless force and energy have given yes pristine health must soon again be mine for all the mental harmonies are thine xxx o thou who climbst at morn the mountain high viewing the impurpled east with joyful eye thence with light step descending to the vale imbibest with ecstasy the breezy gale or piercing through some covert yet untried beating the moist oerhanging boughs aside still movest delighted on with nimble pace the sprinkled dewdrops glittering in thy face listening the brook which idly brawls along and every plumed warblers matin song or when the burnished car by phoebus rolled darts more intense it is rays of liquid gold beneath some ivyfringed cave reclined fancys bright visions rushing on thy mind with spirits bland nursed by the genial powers soothest with melodious notes the sultry hours nor less when each gay verdant scene is lost and winter shoots his darts of polar frost with exercise thy sister pleased to brave the winds fierce issuing from their stormy cave fleet over the smooth and icebound lake to skim while the blood glows in every active limb to follow where the hounds direct their speed urging over hill and dale the rapid steed or by the social blaze with cheerful breast prompting the tale of mirth and frolic jest the rural laugh which springs from heartfelt glee the sprightly dance and artless minstrelsy hygeia fairest nymph of dians train ah why by me so long pursued in vain i see thee not when beams morns purple light when shines the sun with midday fervor bright i meet thee not upon the mountains brow in the wild woodland or the vale below nor by the prattling brook with osiers crowned nor in the cave with flaunting ivy bound and when the minstrel sings with heartfelt glee to him confessed thy charms are hid from me hygeia fairest nymph of dians train ah why by me so long pursued in vain yet sometimes at a distance i survey but dim and through a cloud thy paler ray i snatch the lucid interval and soar awhile with swiftwingd fancy as of yore the muses invocate with zealous prayer nor unpropitious do the muses hear till the cloud thickening veils thy beams in night fancy prone sinks from her aerial height pain whets his stings their torpid force prevails the venom spreads the mental ardour fails still fly hygeia drooping fancy fly a sacred power there is forever nigh love in thy shape my thespia stands unmoved love never deserts what once it truly loved sickness still more forbids it is bonds to start and pity softens more it is tender heart a gentler but more strong attraction reigns and milder energies newbrace it is chains while then my thespias looks each care beguile while in her presence pain and languor smile while on the mind she pours an healing balm and binds it is tempests in an halcyon calm awakens hope and banishes despair and though i feel yet teaches me to bear still fly hygeia thou too fancy fly a strengthening soulinspiring power is nigh let that her influence this her strains refuse thou shall be
