the history of english poetry sect xliv more poetry was written in the single reign of elizabeth than in the two preceding centuries the same causes among others already enumerated and explained which called forth genius and imagination such as the new sources of fiction opened by a study of the classics a familiarity with the french italian and spanish writers the growing elegancies of the english language the diffusion of polished manners the felicities of long peace and public prosperity and a certain freedom and activity of mind which immediately followed the national emancipation from superstition contributed also to produce innumerable compositions in poetry in prosecuting my further examination of the poetical annals of this reign it therefor becomes necessary to reduce such a latitude of materials to some sort of methodical arrangement on which account i shall class and consider the poets of this reign under the general heads or divisions of satire sonnet pastoral and miscellaneous poetry spenser will stand alone without a class and without a rival  satire specifically so called did not commence in england till the latter end of the reign of queen elizabeth we have seen indeed that eclogues and allegories were made the vehicle of satire and that many poems of a satirical tendency had been published long ago and here the censure was rather confined to the corruptions of the clergy than extended to popular follies and vices but the first professed english satirist to speak technically is bishop joseph hall successively bishop of exeter and norwich born at bristowpark within the parish of ashby de la zouch in leicestershire in the year      and at the age of fifteen in the year      admitted into emanuelcollege at cambridge where he remained about eight years he soon became eminent in the theology of those times preached against predestination before prince henry with unrivalled applause and discussed the doctrines of arminianism in voluminous dissertations but so variable are our studies and so fickle is opinion that the poet is better known to posterity than the prelate or the polemic his satires have outlived his sermons at court and his laborious confutations of the brownists one of his later controversial tracts is however remembered on account of the celebrity of its antagonist when milton descended from his dignity to plead the cause of fanaticism and ideal liberty bishop hall was the defender of our hierarchical establishment bail who knew hall only as a theologist seems to have written his life merely because he was one of the english divines at the synod of dort in      from his inflexible and conscientious attachment to the royal and episcopal cause under king charles the first he suffered in his old age the severities of imprisonment and sequestration and lived to see his cathedral converted into a barrack and his palace into an alehouse his uncommon learning was meliorated with great penetration and knowledge of the world and his mildness of manners and his humility were characteristical he died and was obscurely buried without a memorial on his grave in      and in his eighty second year at heigham a small village near norwich where he had sought shelter from the storms of usurpation and the intolerance of presbyterianism  i have had the good fortune to see bishop halls funeralsermon preached some days after his interment on the thirtieth day of september      at saint peters church in norwich by one john whitefoote master of arts and rector of heigham the preacher no contemptible orator before he proceeds to draw a parallel between our prelate and the patriarch israel thus illustrates that part of his character with which we are chiefly concerned and which i am now hastening to consider two years together he was chosen rhetoric professor in the universitie of cambridge and performed the office with extraordinary applause he was noted for a singular wit from his youth a most acute rhetorician and an elegant poet he understood many tongues and in the rhetoric of his own he was second to none that lived in his time fol    it is much to our present purpose to observe that the style of his prose is strongly tinctured with the manner of seneca the writer of the satires is perceptible in some of his gravest polemical or scriptural treatises which are perpetually interspersed with excursive illustrations familiar allusions and observations on life many of them were early translated into french and their character is well drawn by himself in a dedication to james the first who perhaps would have much better relished a more sedate and profound theology seldom any man has offered to your royal hands a greater bundle of his own thoughts nor perhaps more variety of discourse for here shall your majesty find morality like a good handmaid waiting on divinity and divinity like some great lady every day in several dresses speculation interchanged with experience positive theology with polemical textuall with discursorie popular with scholasticall works land      sol vol i p     at the age of twentythree while a student at emanuelcollege and in the

gathering or harvest of rods in reference to the nature of the subject  these satires are marked with a classical precision to which english poetry had yet rarely attained they are replete with animation of style and sentiment the indignation of the satirist is always the result of good sense nor are the thorns of severe invective unmixed with the flowers of pure poetry the characters are delineated in strong and lively coloring and their discriminations are touched with the masterly traces of genuine humor the versification is equally energetic and elegant and the fabric of the couplets approaches to the modern standard it is no inconsiderable proof of a genius predominating over the general taste of an age when every preacher was a punster to have written verses where laughter was to be raised and the reader to be entertained with sallies of pleasantry without quibbles and conceits his chief fault is obscurity arising from a remote phraseology constrained combinations unfamiliar allusions elleiptical apostrophes and abruptness of expression perhaps some will think that his manner betrays too much of the laborious exactness and pedantic anxiety of the scholar and the student ariosto in italian and regnier in french were now almost the only modern writers of satire and i believe there had been an english translation of ariostos satires but halls acknowledged patterns are juvenal and persius not without some touches of the urbanity of horace his parodies of these poets or rather his adaptations of ancient to modern manners a mode of imitation not unhappily practiced by oldham rochester and pope discover great facility and dexterity of invention the moral gravity and the censorial declamation of juvenal he frequently enlivens with a train of more refined reflection or adorns with a novelty and variety of images  in the opening of his general prologue he expresses a decent consciousness of the difficulty and danger of his new undertaking the laurel which he sought had been unworn and it was not to be won without hazard  i first adventure with foolhardy might to tread the steps of perilous despite i first adventure follow me who list and be the second english satirist his first book containing nine satires is aimed at the numerous impotent yet fashionable scribblers with which his age was infested it must be esteemed a curious and valuable picture drawn from real life of the abuses of poetical composition which then prevailed and which our author has at once exposed with the wit of a spirited satirist and the good taste of a judicious critic of spenser who could not have been his cotemporary at cambridge as some have thought but perhaps was his friend he constantly speaks with respect and applause  i avail myself of a more minute analysis of this book not only as displaying the critical talents of our satirist but as historical of the poetry of the present period and illustrative of my general subject and if in general i should be thought too copious and prolix in my examination of these satires my apology must be my wish to revive a neglected writer of real genius and my opinion that the first legitimate author in our language of a species of poetry of the most important and popular utility which our countrymen have so successfully cultivated and from which pope derives his chief celebrity deserved to be distinguished with a particular degree of attention  from the first satire which i shall exhibit at length we learn what kinds of pieces were then most in fashion and in what manner they were written they seem to have been tales of love and chivalry amatorial sonnets tragedies comedies and pastorals  nor ladys wanton love nor wandering knight legend i out in rimes all richly

allusion is to spensers beautiful episode of the marriage of thames and medway recently published in      in the fourth book of the second part of the fairy queen b iv c xi  but had i says the poet been inclined to invoke the assistance of a muse what muse even of a lower order is there now to be found who would condescend to sit and sing on the desolated margin of the came the muses frequent other rivers ever since spenser celebrated the nuptials of thames and medway came has now nothing on his banks but willows the types of desertion  i observe here in general that thomas hudson and henry lock were the bavius and mevius of this age in the return from parnassus   0  they are thus consigned to oblivion by judicio lock and hudson sleep you quiet shavers among the shavings of the press and let your books lie in some old nook amongst old boots and shoes so you may avoid my censure a i s ii  hudson translated into english du bartass poem of judith and holofernes in which is this couplet and at her ear a pearl of greater value there hung than that the egyptian queen did swallow yet he is commended by harrington for making this translation in a very good and sweet english verse transl orl fur notes b xxxv p          hence or from an old play the name holofernes got into shakespeare  and is largely cited in englands parnassus   00 lock applied the sonnet to a spiritual purpose and substituting christian love in the place of amorous passion made it the vehicle of humiliation holy comfort and thanksgiving this book he dedicated under the title of the passionate present to queen elizabeth who perhaps from the title expected to be entertained with a subject of very different nature i have before cited this collection which appeared in      vol iii     that was a second edition to his ecclesiastes there is a recommendatory poem by lilly some of davids psalms in verse appear with his name the same year   in the second satire our author poetically laments that the nine muses are no longer vestal virgins  whilom the muses nine were vestal maids and held their temple in the secret shades of fair parnassvs that twoheaded hill whose ancient fame the southern world did fill and in the stead of their eternal fame was the cool stream that took his endless name from out the fertile hoof of winged steed there did they sit and do their holy deed that pleased both heaven and earth  he complains that the rabble of rymesters new have engrafted the myrtle on the bay and that poetry departing from its ancient moral tendency has been unnaturally perverted to the purposes of corruption and impurity the muses have changed in defiance of chastity their modest stole to garish looser weed decked with louefauours their late whoredoms meed while the pellucid spring of pyrene is converted into a poisonous and muddy puddle   whose infectious stain corrupts all the lowly fruitful plain b i   f    marlows ovids elegies and some of the dissolute sallies of

there is venus and adonis true model of a most lascivious letcher    in the subsequent satire our author more particularly censures the intemperance of his brethren and illustrates their absolute inability to write till their imaginations were animated by wine in the following apt and witty comparison which is worthy of young  as frozen dunghills in a winters morn that void of vapors seemed all beforn soon as the sun sends out his piercing beams exhale forth filthy smoke and stinking steams so does the base and the forebarren brain soon as the raging wine begins to reign in the succeeding lines he confines his attack to marlow eminent for his drunken frolicks who was both a player and a poet and whose tragedy of tamerlane the great represented before the year      published

suddenly and most seasonably introduced  now lest such frightful shows of fortvnes fall and bloody tyrants rage should chance appall the deadstruck audience mid the silent rout comes leaping in a

a goodly grace to sober tragic muse when each base clown his clumsy fist does bruise in striking the benches to express applause  to complete these genuine and humorous anecdotes of the state of our stage in the reign of elizabeth i make no apology for adding the paragraph immediately following which records the infancy of theatric criticism  meanwhile our poets in high parliament sit watching every word and gesturement like curious censors of some doutie gear whispering their verdict in their fellows ear woe to the word whose margin in their scrole copy  is noted with a black condemning coal but if each period might the synod please ho bring the ivy boughs and bands of bays b i   f    in the beginning of the next satire he resumes this topic he seems to have conceived a contempt for blank verse observing that the english iambic is written with little trouble and seems rather a spontaneous effusion than an artificial construction  too popular is tragic poesy straining his tiptoes for a farthing fee and does beside on rimeless numbers tread unbid iambicks flow from careless head he next inveighs against the poet who  in high heroic rimes compileth wormeat stories of old times to these antique tales he condemns the application of the extravagant enchantments of ariostos orlando furioso particularly of such licentious fictions as the removal of merlins tomb from wales into france or tuscany by the magic operations of the sorceress melissa see orl fur iii  0 xxvi     the orlando had been just now translated by harrington  and makes up his hardbetaken tale with strange enchantments fetched from darksom vale of some melissa who by magic doom to tuscans soil transporteth merlins tomb but he suddenly checks his career and retracts his thoughtless temerity in presuming to blame such themes as had been immortalised by the fairy muse of spenser  but let no rebel satyr dare traduce the eternal legends of thy faerie muse renowned spenser whom no earthly wight dares once to emulate much less dares despite salust du bartas of france and tuscan ariost yield up the laurel garland ye have lost b i   f    in the stanzas called a defiance to envy prefixed to the satires he declares his reluctance and inability to write pastorals after spenser at colins feet i throw my yielding reed but in some of those stanzas in which he means to ridicule the pastoral he proves himself admirably qualified for this species of poetry  in the fifth he ridicules the whining ghosts of the mirror of magistrates which the ungenerous and unpitying poet sends back to hell without a penny to pay charon for their return over the river styx b i   f      in the sixth he laughs at the hexametrical versification of the roman prosody so contrary to the genius of our language lately introduced into english poetry by stanihurst the translator of virgil and patronised by gabriel harvey and sir philip sidney  another scorns the homespun thread of rimes matched with the lofty feet of elder

laboring to delay the breathless dactyls with a sudden stay b i   f        his own lines on the subject are a proof that english verse wanted to borrow no graces from the roman  the false and foolish compliments of the sonnetwriter are the object of the seventh satire be she all sooty black or berry brown she is white as morrows milk or flakes newblown he judges it absurd that the world should be troubled with the history of the smiles or frowns of a lady as if all mankind were deeply interested in the privacies of a lovers heart and the momentary revolutions of his hope and despair b i   f      in the eighth our author insinuates his disapprobation of sacred poetry and the metrical versions of scripture which were encouraged and circulated by the puritans he glances at robert southwells saint peters complaint wood says that this poem was written by davies of hereford ath oxon i     but he had given it to southwell p      in which the saint weeps pure helicon published this year and

critic solomon assumes the character of a modern sonnetteer and celebrates the sacred spouse of christ with the levities and in the language of a lover singing the praises of his mistress b i   f

unworthy profanation of their dignity  take this ye muses this so high despite and let all hateful luckless birds of night let screeching owls nest in your razed roofs and let your floor with horned satyrs hoofs be dinted and defiled every morn and let your walls be an eternal scorn his execration of the infamy of adding to the mischiefs of obscenity by making it the subject of a book is strongly

study they frequented taverns became libertines and buffoons and exhilarated the circles of the polite and the profligate their way of life gave the color to their writings and what had been the favorite topic of conversation was sure to please when recommended by the graces of poetry add to this that poets now began to write for hire and a rapid sale was to be obtained at the expense of the

a true genius however he wants one true note of a poet of our times and that is this he cannot swagger it well in a tavern a i s ii   the first satire of the second book properly belongs to the last in it our author continues his just and pointed animadversions on immodest poetry and hints at some pernicious versions from the facetiae of poggius florentinus and from rabelais the last couplet of the passage i am going to transcribe is most elegantly expressive  but who conjured this bawdie poggies ghost from out the stews of his lewd homebred coast or wicked rablais drunken reuellings harvey

in the second satire he celebrates the wisdom and liberality of our ancestors in erecting magnificent mansions for the accommodation of scholars which yet at present have little more use than that of reproaching the rich with their comparative neglect of learning the verses have much dignity and are equal to the subject  to what end did our lavish ancestors erect of old those stately piles of ours

paper with my restless quill to pore on painted leaves or beat my brain with farfetched thought or to consvme in uaine in latter even or midst of winter nights illsmelling oils or some stillwatching lights etc he concludes his complaint of the general disregard of the literary profession with a spirited paraphrase of that passage of persius in which the philosophy of the profound arcesilaus and of the aerumnosi solones is proved to be of so little use and estimation b ii   f    in the last line of this satire he says let swinish grill delight in dunghill clay gryllus is one of ulyssess companions transformed into a hog by circe who refuses to be restored to his human shape but perhaps the allusion is immediately to spenser fair qu ii         in the third he laments the lucrative injustice of the law while ingenuous science is without emolument or reward the exordium is a fine improvement of his original  who doubts the laws fell down from heauens hight like to some gliding star in winters night themis the scribe of god did long agone engrave them deep in during marble stone and cast them down on this unruly clay that men might know to rule and to obey the interview between the anxious client and the rapacious lawyer is drawn with much humor and shows the authoritative superiority and the mean subordination subsisting between the two characters at that time  the crowching client with lowbended knee and many worships and fair flattery tells on his tale as smoothly as him list but still the lawyers eye squints on his fist if that seem lined with a larger fee doubt not the suite the law is plain for thee tho yet even must he buy his vainer hope with price disclout his crowns pull them out of his purse  and thank him for advice b ii   f     i cite a couplet from this satire to explain it genus and species long since barfoote went upon their tentoes in wild wonderment etc this is an allusion to an old distich made and often quoted in the age of scholastic science dat galenus opes dat justinianus honores sed genus et species cogitur ire pedes   that is the study of medicine produces riches and jurisprudence leads to stations and offices of honor while the professor of logic is poor and obliged to walk on foot    the fourth displays the difficulties and discouragements of the physician here we learn that the sick lady and the gouty peer were then topics of the ridicule of the satirist  the sickly lady and the gowtie peer still would i haunt that love their life so dear where life is dear who cares for coined dross that spent is counted gain and spared loss he thus laughs at the quintessence of a sublimated mineral elixir  each powdered grain ransometh captive kings purchases realms and life prolonged brings b ii   f     imperial oils golden cordials and universal panaceas are of high antiquity and perhaps the puffs of quackery were formerly more ostentatious than even at present before the profession of medicine was freed from the operations of a spurious and superstitious alchemy and when there were mystics in philosophy as well in religion paracelsus was the father of empericism  from the fifth we learn that advertisements of a living wanted were affixed on one of the doors of saint pauls cathedral  sawst thou ere siquis siquis was the first word of advertisements often published on the doors of saint pauls decker says the

says mine almanac the numerous astrological tracts particularly pieces called prognostications published in the reign of queen elizabeth are a proof how strongly the people were infatuated with this sort of divination one of the most remarkable was a treatise written in the year      by richard harvey brother to gabriel harvey a learned astrologer of cambridge predicting the portentous conjunction of the primary planets saturn and jupiter which was to happen the next year it had the immediate effect of throwing the whole kingdom into the most violent consternation when the fears of

were young that now are old when quiet saturn swayed the mace of lead and pride was yet unborne and yet unbred time was that whiles the autumnefall did last our hungry sires gaped for the falling mast

  f     one of the vanities of the age of elizabeth was the erection of monuments equally costly and cumbersome charged with a waste of capricious decorations and loaded with superfluous and disproportionate sculpture they succeeded to the rich solemnity of the gothic shrine which yet amid a profusion of embellishments preserved uniform principles of architecture  in the second satire our author moralizes on these empty memorials which were alike allotted to illustrious or infamous characters  some stately tomb he builds egyptianwise rex regum written on the pyramid whereas great arthur lies in ruder oak that never felt aught but the fellers stroke he alludes to the discovery of king arthurs body in glastonbury abbey lately in digging up a barrow or tumulus on the downs near

great secrecy whereas no passengers might curse thy dust etc b iii   f  0  the third is the description of a citizens feast to which he was invited with hollow words and ouerly slight shallow request   but the great profusion of the entertainment was not the effect of liberality but a hint that no second invitation must be expected the effort was too great to be repeated the guest who dined at this table often had only a single dish b iii   f      the fourth is an arraignment of ostentatious piety and of those who strove to push themselves into notice and esteem by petty pretensions the illustrations are highly humorous  who ever gives a pair of velvet shoes to the holy rood in a gallery over the screen at entering the choir was a large crucifix or rood with the images of the holy virgin and saint john the velvet shoes were for the feet of christ on the cross or of one of the attendant figures a rich lady sometimes bequeathed her weddinggown with necklace and earrings to dress

droll portrait of the distress of a lusty courtier or fine gentleman whose periwinkle or peruke was suddenly blown off by a boisterous puff of wind while he was making his bows in a set of articles of enquiry sent to a college in oxford about the year      by the visitor bishop morley the commissary is ordered diligently to remark and report whether any of the senior fellows wore periwigs i will not suppose that bobwigs are here intended but after such a proscription who could imagine that the bushy grizzlewig should ever have been adopted as a badge of gravity so arbitrary are ideas of dignity or levity in dress there is an epigram in harrington written perhaps about   00 of gallas goodly periwigge b i    this was undoubtedly false hair in haymans quodlibets or epigrams printed

finds strange curse but fit for such a fickle age when scalpes are subject to such vassalage  is it not sweet pride when men their crowns must shade with that which jerkes the hams of every jade b iii   f     in the next is the figure of a famished gallant or beau which is much better drawn than in any of the comedies of those times his hand is perpetually on the hilt of his rapier he picks his teeth but has dined with duke humphry that is he has walked all day in saint pauls church without a dinner in the body of old saint pauls was a huge and conspicuous monument of sir john beauchamp

objections of certain critics who falsely and foolishly thought his satires too perspicuous nothing could be more absurd than the notion that because persius is obscure therefore obscurity must be necessarily one of the qualities of satire if persius under the severities of a proscriptive and sanguinary government was often obliged to conceal his meaning this was not the case of hall but the darkness and difficulties of persius arise in great measure from his own affectation and false taste he would have been enigmatical under the mildest government to be unintelligible can never naturally or properly belong to any species of writing hall of himself is certainly obscure yet he owes some of his obscurity to an imitation of this ideal excellence of the roman satirists  the fourth book breathes a stronger spirit of indignation and abounds with applications of juvenal to modern manners yet with the appearance of original and unborrowed satire  the first is miscellaneous and excursive but the subjects often lead to an unbecoming licentiousness of language and images in the following nervous lines he has caught and finely heightened the force and manner of his master  who list excuse when chaster dames can hire some snoutfair stripling to their apple squire some fairfaced stripling to be their page marston has this epithet sc villan b i    had i some snoutfaire

 whom staked up like to some stallion steed they keep with eggs and oysters for the breed o lucine barren caia has an heir after her husbands dozen years despair and now the bribed midwife swears apace the bastard babe does bear his fathers face he thus enhances the value of certain novelties by declaring them to be worth little less than landing of a whale or gades spoils cadiz was newly taken  or a churls funerale   the allusion is to spensers talus in the following couplet gird but the cynickes helmet on his head cares he for talus or his flayle of lead   he adds that the guilty person when marked destroys all distinction like the cuttlefish concealed in his own blackness  long as the crafty cuttle lies sure in the black cloud of his thick vomiture who list complain of wronged faith or fame when he may shift it to anothers name he thus describes the effect of his satire and the enjoyment of his own success in this species of poetry  now see i fireflakes sparkle from

arbitrary spirit of oppression and monopoly  the third is on the pride of pedigree the introduction is from juvenals eighth satire and the substitution of the memorials of english ancestry such as were then fashionable in the place of juvenals parade of family statues without arms or ears is remarkably happy but the humor is half lost unless by recollecting the roman original the reader

superstitious practices of popery with which it is easy to make sport but our author has done this by an uncommon quickness of allusion poignancy of ridicule and fertility of burlesque invention were juvenal to appear at rome he says  how his enraged ghost would stamp and stare that cesars throne is turned to peters chair to see an old shorn lozel perched high crouching beneath a golden canopie  and for the lordly fasces borne of old to see two quiet crossed keys of gold  but that he most would gaze and wonder at is the horned mitre and the bloody hat cardinals scarlet hat  the crooked staff bishops crosier  the coules strange form and store and multitude of them  save that he saw the same in hell before the following ludicrous ideas are annexed to the exclusive appropriation of the eucharistic wine to the priest in the mass  the whiles the liquorous priest spits every trice with longing for his morning sacrifice which he reares up quite perpendiculare that the mid church does spite the chancels fare b iv    but this sort of ridicule is improper and dangerous it has a tendency even without an entire parity of circumstances to burlesque the celebration of this aweful solemnity in the reformed church in laughing at false religion we may sometimes hurt the true though the rites of the papistic eucharist are erroneous and absurd yet great part of the ceremony and above all the radical idea belong also to the protestant communion  sect xlvi the argument of the first satire of the fifth book is the oppressive exaction of landlords the consequence of the growing decrease of the value of money one of these had perhaps a poor grandsire who grew rich by availing himself of the general rapine at the dissolution of the monasteries there is great pleasantry in one of the lines that he begged a cast abbey in the churchs wayne   in the mean time the old patrimonial mansion is desolated and even the parish church unroofed and dilapidated through the poverty of the inhabitants and neglect or avarice of the patron  would it not vex thee where thy sires did keep live inhabit  to see the dunged folds of dagtayld sheep and ruined house where holy things were said whose freestone walls the thatched roof vpbraid whose shrill saintsbell hangs on his lovery while the rest are damned to the plumbery the bells were all sold and melted down except that for necessary use the saintsbell or sanctusbell was only suffered to remain within its lovery that is louver or turret usually placed between the chancel and body of the church marston has pitchblack loueries sc villan b ii    yet pure devotion lets the steeple stand and idle battlements on either hand etc just to keep up the appearance of a church  by an enumeration of real circumstances he gives us the following lively draught of the miserable tenement yet ample services of a poor copyholder  of one bays breadth god wot a silly cote whose thatched spars are furred with sluttish soote a whole inch thick shining like blackmoors brows through smoke that down the headless barrel blows at his beds feet feeden his stalled teame his swine beneath his pullen oer the beam a starued tenement such as i guess stands straggling on the wastes of holdernesse or such as shivers on a peake hill side etc  yet must he haunt his greedy landlords hall with often presents at each festival with crammed capons every newyeares morn or with green cheeses when his sheep are shorn or many maundsfull maund is basket hence maundaythursday the thursday in passionweek when the king with his own hands distributes a large portion of alms etc maunday is dies sportulae maund occurs again b iv   with a manud charged with household merchandise in the whippinge of the satyr   0  signat c   whole maunds and baskets full of fine sweet praise  of his mellow fruit etc the lords acceptance of these presents is touched with much humor  the smiling landlord shows a sunshine face feigning that he will grant him further grace and leers like esops fox upon the crane whose neck he craves for his chirurgian b v  f     in the second in this satire there is an allusion to an elegant fiction in chaucer v   f    certes if pity dyed at chaucers date chaucer places the sepulcher of pity in the court of love see court of l v  00  a tender creature is shrinid there and pity is her name she saw an egle wreke him on a fly and pluck his wing and eke him in his game and tendir heart of that has made her die this thought is borrowed by fenton in his mariamne  he reprehends the incongruity of splendid edifices and worthless inhabitants  like the vain bubble of iberian pride that overcroweth all the world beside the escurial in spain  which reared to raise the crazy monarchs fame strives for a court and for a college name yet naught within but lousy coules does hold like a scabbd cuckoo in a cage of gold  when as when maevios first page of his poesy nailed to a hundred posts for nouelty with his big title

draws and with a selection of the most picturesque natural circumstances the inhospitality or rather desertion of an old magnificent rural mansion  beat the broad gates a goodly hollow sound with double echoes does again rebound but not a dog does bark to welcome thee nor churlish porter can thou chafing see all dumb and silent like the dead of night or dwelling of some sleepy sybarite the marble pavement hid with desert weed with houseleek thistle dock and hemlockseed  look to the towered chimnies which should be the windpipes of good hospitality  lo there the unthankful swallow takes her rest and fills the tunnell with her circled nest the motto on the front of the house oydeis eisito which he calls a fragment of platos poetry is a humorous alteration of platos oydeis akathaptos eisito  afterward the figure of famine is thus imagined  grim famine sits in their forepined face all full of angles of unequal space like to the plane of manysided squares that wont be drawn out by geometars b v    in the third a satire is compared to the porcupine the satire should be like the porcupine that shoots sharp quills out in each angry line b v    this ingenious thought though founded on a vulgar error has been copied among other passages by oldham of a true writer of satire he says he would shoot his quills just like a porcupine at view and make them stab in every line apology for the foregoing ode etc works vol i p    edit        mo    in the fourth and last of this book he enumerates the extravagancies of a married spendthrift a farmers heir of twenty pounds a year he rides with two liveries and keeps a pack of hounds  but whiles ten pound goes to his wifes new gown not little less can serve to suite his own while one piece pays her idle waitingman or buys an hood or siluerhandled fan or hires a friezeland trotter half yard deep to drag his tumbrell through the staring cheap b v    the last book consisting of one long satire only is a sort of epilogue to the whole and contains a humorous ironical description of the effect of his satires and a recapitulatory view of many of the characters and foibles which he had before delineated but the scribblers seem to have the chief share the character of labeo already repeatedly mentioned who was some cotemporary poet a constant censurer of our author and who from pastoral proceeded to heroic poetry is here more distinctly represented he was a writer who affected compound epithets which sir philip sydney had imported from france and first used in his arcadia we have our authors opinion of skeleton in these lines of this satire f    well might these checks have fitted former times and shouldered angry skeltons breathelesse rimes   the character in many respects suits chapman though i do not recollect that he wrote any pastorals  that labeo reads right who can deny the true strains of heroic poesy for he can tell how fury reft his sense and phoebus filled him with intelligence he can implore the heathen deities to guide his bold and busy enterprise or filch whole pages at a clap for need from honest petrarch clad in english weed while big but ohs each stanza can begin whose trunk and tail sluttish and heartlesse been he knows the grace of that new elegance which sweet philisides fetched late from france that well beseemd his highstild arcady though others mar it with much liberty in epithets to join two words in one forsooth for adjectives cannot stand alone the arts of composition must have been much practiced and a knowledge of critical niceties widely diffused when observations of this kind could be written he proceeds to remark it was now customary for every poet before he attempted the dignity of heroic verse to try his strength by writing pastorals though these lines bear a general sense yet at the same time they seem to be connected with the character of labeo by which they are introduced by the carmelite a pastoral writer ranked with theocritus and virgil he means mantuan   but ere his muse her weapon learn to wield or dance a sober pirrhicke the pyrrhic dance performed in armor in the field  the sheepecote first has been her nursery where she has worn her idle infancy and in high startups walked the pasturd plains to tend her tasked herd that there remains and winded still a pipe of oate or breare etc poems on petty subjects or occasions on the death of a favorite bird or dog seem to have been as common in our authors age as at present he says  should bandells throstle die without a song or adamans my dog be laid along down in some ditch without his exequies in pursuance of the argument he adds folly itself or boldness may be praised an allusion to erasmuss moriae encomium and the encomium calvitiei written at the restoration of learning cardan also wrote an encomium on nero the gout etc  or epitaphs or mournful elegies in this satire tarleton is praised as a poet who is most commonly considered only as a comedian meres

here mentioned i presume is jovinianus pontanus an elegant latin amatorial and pastoral poet of italy at the revival of learning  one is surprised to recollect that these satires are the production of a young man of twenty three they rather seem the work of an experienced master of long observation of study and practice in composition  they are recited among the best performances of the kind and with applause by francis meres a cotemporary critic who wrote in      wit treas f     it is extraordinary that they should not have afforded any choice flowers to englands parnassus printed in   00  but whatever fame they had acquired it soon received a check which was never recovered they were condemned to the flames as licentious and immoral by an order of bishop bancroft in      and this is obviously the chief reason why they are not named by our author in the specialities of his life written by himself after his preferment to a bishopric shaking of the olive or his remaining works    0  to nor are they here inserted  they were however admired and imitated by oldham and pope who modernised done is said to have wished he had seen halls satires sooner but had pope undertaken to modernise hall he must have adopted because he could not have improved many of his lines hall is too finished and smooth for such an operation done though he lived so many years later was susceptible of modern refinement and his asperities were such as wanted and would bear the chissel  i was informed by the late learned bishop of gloucester that in a copy of halls satires in popes library the whole first satire of the sixth book was corrected in the margin or interlined in popes own hadn and that pope had written at the head of that satire optima satira  milton who had a controversy with hall as i have observed in a remonstrance called an apology for smectymnuus published in      rather unsuitably and disingenuously goes out of his way to attack these satires a juvenile effort of his dignified adversary and under every consideration alien to the dispute miltons strictures are more sarcastic than critical yet they deserve to be cited more especially as they present a striking specimen of those awkward attempts at humor and raillery which disgrace his proseworks  lighting upon this title of toothless satyrs i will not conceal ye what i thought readers that sure this must be some sucking satyr who might have done better to have used his coral and made an end of breeding ere he took upon him to wield a satyrs whip but when i heard him talk of scouring the shields of elvish knights a misquoted line in the defiance to envy prefixed to the satires i will give the whole passage which is a compliment to spenser and shows how happily hall would have succeeded in the majestic march of the long stanza or scour the rusted swords of elvish knights bathed in pagan blood or sheathe them new in mistie moral types or tell their fights who mighty giants or who monsters slew and by some strange enchanted spear and shield vanquished their foe and won the doubtful field may be she might in stately stanzas frame stories of ladies and aduenturous knights to raise her silent and inglorious name unto a reachlesse pitch of praises hight and somewhat say as more unworthy done that is have done  worthy of brass and hoary marble stone   do not blame me if i changed my thought and concluded him some desperate cutler but why his scornful muse could never abide with tragic shoes her ancles for to hide b i    the pace of the verse told me that her mawkin knuckles were never shapen to that royal buskin and turning by chance to the sixth seventh satyr of his second book i was confirmed where having begun loftily in heavens universal alphabet he falls down to that wretched poorness and frigidity as to talk of bridgestreet in heaven and the ostler of heaven hall supposes that the twelve signs of the zodiac are twelve inns in the highstreet of heaven  with twelve fair signs ever well tended by our stardivines of the astrologers who give their attendance some are ostlers others chamberlaines etc the zodiacal sign aquarius he supposes to be in the bridgestreet of heaven he alludes to bridgestreet at cambridge and the signs are of inns at cambridge  and there wanting other matter to catch him a heat for certain he was on the frozen zone miserably benumbed with thoughts lower than any beadles betakes him to whip the signposts of cambridge alehouses the ordinary subject of freshmens tales and in a strain as pitiful which for him who would be counted the first english satyrist to abase himself to who might have learned better among the latin and italian satyrists and in our own tongue from the vision and creed of pierce plowman besides others before him manifested a presumptuous undertaking with weak and unexamined shoulders for a satyr is as it were born out of a tragedy so ought to resemble his parentage to strike high and adventure dangerously at the most eminent vices among the greatest persons and not to creep into every blind taphouse that fears a constable more than a satyr but that such a poem should be toothless i still affirm it to be a bull taking away the essence of that which it calls itself for if it bite neither the persons nor the vices how is it a satyr and if it bite either how is it toothless so that toothless satyrs are as much as if he had said toothless teeth etc apology for smectymnuus miltons proseworks vol i p     edit amst school fol see also p               with halls satires should be ranked his mundus alter et

furnished with gowns at his fathers funerals what exploits he did at cales and newport etc p         of the busy body if he see but two men talk and read a letter in the street he runs to them and

psalms work ut supr p     in the dedication he says indeed my poetry was long sithence out of date and yielded her place to grauer studies etc in his epistles he speaks of this unfinished undertaking many great wits have undertaken this task  among the rest were those two rare spirits of the sidnyes to whom poesy was as natvrall as it is affected of others and our worthy friend mr sylvester has

epistolary composition which england had seen bishop hall he says was not only our first satirist but was the first who brought epistolary writing to the view of the public which was common in that age to other parts of europe but not practiced in england till he published his own epistles see whalleys inquiry into the learning of shakespeare p     and hall himself in the dedication of his

roger ascham who flourished about the time of the reformation and when that mode of writing had been cultivated by the best scholars in various parts of europe was celebrated for the terseness of his epistolary style i believe the second published correspondence of this kind and in our own language at least of any importance after hall will be found to be epistolae hoelianae or the letters of james howell a great traveller an intimate friend of jonson and the first who bore the office of the royal historiographer which discover a variety of literature and abound with much entertaining and useful information epistolae hoelianae familiar letters domestic and foreign divided into sundry sections partly historical political and philosophical land       to they had five editions from

john marston on his comedy of the malecontent p  0   in general it is not easy to give a specimen of marstons satires as his strongest lines are either openly vitiated with gross expression or pervaded with a hidden vain of impure sentiment the following humorous portrait of a sick inamorato is in his best at least in his chastest manner of drawing a character  for when my ears received a fearful sound that he was sick i went and there i found him laid of love the midwifes phrase  and newly brought to bed of monstrous folly and a frantic head his chamber hanged about with elegies with sad complaints of his loves miseries his windows strowd with sonnets and the glass drawn full of loueknotts i approacht the ass and straight he weeps and sighs some sonnet out to his fair love and then he goes about for to perfvme her rare perfection with some sweet smelling pinkepitheton then with a melting look he writhes his head and straight in passion rises in his bed and having kissed his hand strokd up his hair made a french conge cries o cruel fair to the antique bedpost  in these lines there is great elegance of allusion and vigor of expression he addresses the objects of his satire as the sons of the giants  is minos dead is rhadamanth asleep that thus ye dare unto ioues palace creep what has rhamnusia spent her knotted whip that ye dare strive on hebes cup to sip yet know apollos quiver is not spent but can abate your daring hardiment python is slain yet his accursed race dare look divine astrea in the face sat    in the same satire he calls himself a beadle to the worlds impuritie   marston seems to have been the poetic rival of hall at cambridge whom he repeatedly censures or ridicules in the fourth satire he supposes halls criticisms on dubartas the versions of davids psalms by sternhold and king james southwells mary and saint peters tears the mirror of magistrates and other pieces of equal reputation to be the production of pedantry or malignity and the remainder of this satire is no unpleasant parody of halls prefatory stanzas against envy it appears from the scourge of villainy that hall had caused a severe epigram to be pasted on the last page of every copy of marstons pigmalions image that was sent from london to the booksellers of cambridge b iii  0 the epigram is there cited this tenth satire of the third book was added in the second

of the workmanship of a laced and plaited ruff to the labored nicety of the steelwork of woodstock is just he adds with an appearance of wit it has more doubles far than ajax shield this was no exaggeration the shield of ajax was only sevenfold to say nothing of one of the leading ideas the delicacy of contexture which could not belong to such a shield  but marston is much better known as a

obliged to refrain from producing any more citations there are however a few more passages which may safely be quoted but which i choose to reserve for future illustration  there is a carelessness and laxity in marstons versification but there is a freedom and facility which hall has too frequently missed by laboring to confine the sense to the couplet halls measures are more musical not because the music of verse consists in uniformity of pause and regularity of cadence hall had a correcter ear and his lines have a tuneful strength in proportion as his language is more polished his phraseology more select and his structure more studied halls meaning among other reasons is not always so soon apprehended on account of his compression both in sentiment and diction marston is more perspicuous as he thinks less and writes hastily hall is superior in penetration accurate conception of character acuteness of reflection and the accumulation of thoughts and images hall has more humor marston more acrimony hall often draws his materials from books and the diligent perusal of other satirists marston from real life yet hall has a larger variety of characters he possessed the talent of borrowing with address and of giving originality to his copies on the whole hall is more elegant exact and elaborate  it is marstons misfortune that he can never keep clear of the impurities of the brothel his stream of poetry if sometimes bright and unpolluted almost always betrays a muddy bottom the satirist who too freely indulges himself in the display of that licentiousness which he means to proscribe absolutely defeats his own design he inflames those passions which he professes to suppress gratifies the depravations of a prurient curiosity and seduces innocent minds to an acquaintance with ideas which they might never have known  the satires of hall and marston were condemned to the same flame and by the same authority but hall certainly deserved a milder sentence hall exposes vice not in the wantonness of description but with the reserve of a cautious yet lively moralist perhaps every censurer of obscenity does some harm by turning the attention to an immodest object but this effect is to be counteracted by the force and propriety of his reproof by showing the pernicious consequences of voluptuous excesses by suggesting motives to an opposite conduct and by making the picture disgustful by dashes of deformity when vice is led forth to be sacrificed at the shrine of virtue the victim should not be too richly dressed  sect xlviii the popularity of halls

booksellers that its steeple was thrown down by lightening in      and that a general reparation of the church was now become a great object of the nation    but of this more distinct proofs will appear in the progress of our history  it must not be forgotten that a second impression of an english version of ariostos satires which contain many anecdotes of his life and circumstances and some humourous tales and which are marked with a strong vein of free reprehension but with much less obscenity than might be expected from satires written by the author of orlando furioso appeared in long verse by an anonymous translator in      ariostos seven planets governing italy or his satyrs in seven famous discourses etc newly corrected and augmented etc with a new edition of three most

bodleian edition a scourge for paperpersecutors by i d with an inquisition against paperpersecutors by a h london for h h      in quarto but wood had seen a detached edition of the former piece he

similarity of subject with its companion an inquisition against paperpersecutors in the year      as i have just noticed  owens idea of an epigram points out the notion which now prevailed of this kind of composition and shows the propriety of blending the epigrams and satires of these times under one class a satire he says is an epigram on a larger scale epigrams are only satires in miniature an epigram must be satirical and a satire epigrammatical robert hayman above quoted thus recommends his own epigrams quodlibets b iv    p    epigrams are like satyrs rough without like chestnuts sweet take thou the kernel out   and jonson in the dedication of his epigrams to lord pembroke was so far from viewing this species of verse in its original plan as the most harmless and inoffensive species of verse that he supposes it to be conversant above the likeness of vice and facts and is conscious that epigrams carry danger in the sound yet in one of his epigrams addressed to the mere english censvrer he professes not exactly to follow the track of the late and most celebrated epigrammatists  to thee my way in epigrammes seems new when both it is the old way and the true thou say that

epigrammatist cent xx p       this however discovers the opinion of the general reader  of the popularity of the epigram about the year   00 if no specimens had remained a proof may be drawn together with evidences of the nature of the composition from marstons humourous character of tuscus a retailer of wit  but room for tuscus that iestmoungering youth who near did open his apish gerning mouth but to retaile and broke anothers wit discourse of what you will he straight can fit your present talk with sir i will tell a jest  of some sweet lady or grand lord at least then on he goes and near
