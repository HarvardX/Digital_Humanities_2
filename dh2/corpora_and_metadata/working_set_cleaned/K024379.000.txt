reflections concerning the virtues of tar water  wherein is proved by experience that its present preparation is not founded upon philosophical principles and that as now prepared it may probably occasion more diseases than it can possibly cure  with hints for its improvement so as to make it a most efficacious and pleasant medicine  by h jackson chemist  homines ad deos nulla re propius accedunt quam salutem hominibus dando tull london printed for j robinson at the golden lion in ludgate street      price four pence  reflections concerning the virtues of tar water etc tar water as it is lately ordered by the bishop of cloyne being at present almost as universal in its use as it is proved to be in its properties by this learned author i hope it will not be thought presumptuous in me to undertake to prove why and in what manner it may be improved in its excellent qualifications by a particular management in its preparation since nothing but the general good of mankind is hereby aimed at and though the learned bishop has given directions to prepare it in a very simple manner probably with the intention that it might be equally serviceable to the poor and rich yet i think few reasons can be assigned why the rich may not be supplied with a mose neat and certainly a more efficacious remedy especially since the price even then will not much exceed the present rate as i shall endeavor to prove  norway tar as it is now imported is unquestionably the best for this most noble medicine as being endowed with the most fragrant and subtle parts beyond other tars which is evident by its smell and by its taste as being least acrimonious and it has been proved by several ingenious chemists that it partakes least of that heating sulphurous property which abounds in all these balsams either more or less  common tar or tar from hot climates is not so well saturated with this fine volatile aromatic flavor this perhaps in some measure may be owing to the influence of the sun which exhales all the finest parts except those that are closely connected and suppressed by the viscid juices of the trees whereas in colder regions the pores of the trees are more close and compact and by that means these subtle parts are more detained and locked up in their proper cells from whence proceeds the siner flavor but notwithstanding this the best norway tar as it is now imported is so loaded with heterogeneous matter such as sticks straws flies sand and various other bodies which cannot be defined and which cannot subside in the barrel by reason of its consistence or thickness it being defignd more for the use of ships than medicine that a method ought to be considered which way to refine it like other natural balsams without damaging its natural properties this none but the chemic art can well effect so that it is needless to deliver the process since none but chemists can perform it with success and that they can do at a trifling expense by this method it is so contrived that the pungent taste of the water is greatly lessened and it is not so apt to regurgitate upon weak stomachs which frequently happens to the fair sex and renders them incapable of retaining it for whose particular maladies it is peculiarly excellent as is unquestionably proved by the author of siris sect        0  and      the next thing i shall take notice of is the water our author has not expressly informed us what sort to make use of so that we might use any sort indifferently was it not that our own reason is sufficient to convince us what sort to prefer but lest the injudicious part of mankind may not comprehend what is meant i shall endeavor to prove what water ought to be preferred in compounding this most valuable medicine  our author tells us in sect   0 of his siris that tar water ought to be taken for some considerable time in chronic cases such as the gravel gout scurvy etc and that he has known very great advantages procured thereby which did not begin to appear till it had been taken two or three months which circumstance in all alteratives ought to be but seldom is regarded now as such a long time must be allowed to complete the cure of a chronic distemper it follows that a large quantity of water must be drank during this time perhaps the quantity of twenty or thirty gallons or it may be three times as much before it be entirely forborne but admit that in painful distempers as the gout and rheumatism it should only procure ease during the taking it and a relapse should ensue upon omitting it as it may justly be suspected sometimes to fall short of a perfect cure in the gout or scurvy then it naturally follows that a patient would continue taking it perhaps for years or so long as he perceived any good effect by its use now as there is thus sometimes a necessity for drinking so great a quantity of water it may justly be disputed whether the cure might not be of worse consequence to the patient than the disease i mean by employing an improper water in making the medicine for most waters are widely different in their properties according to the various sources from whence they arise as for instance wellwaters chiefly are impregnated with mineral or metalline particles and riverwaters which i suppose are chiefly used in london for this medicine abound with diverse heterogeneous particles according to the various soils they glide upon and there is no water at all so pure but is loaded either more or less with something foreign to itself if any one disputes the truth of this let him but inspect the infide of one of the ladys teakettles and that will certainly convince him or look into one of the leaden pipes which conveys this water for kitchen use even if it has been laid but for three months and he will find the inside lined with a stony concrete then without any cavilling or entering into any abstruse mathematical demonstration in this point i shall leave every one to judge what must be the consequence of drinking so much of this crude water which must be done in the common method of making tar water  but that i may not be thought singular in my opinion i shall just beg leave to subjoin some quotations from authors of established reputation for learning and genius to confirm what i have already advanced and then propose a method how to avoid this evil at a small expense  most naturalists tell us of surprising instances of some waters which are of such a petrifying nature that in rivulets wherein watermills have been fixed the periphery which catches the water in small boxes has been petrified to such a degree that the owners have been obliged to clear it frequently with proper instruments in order to facilitate the motion of the wheel such an instance as this i have seen and whoever inspects the waterworks of london bridge will find something to the same purpose  dr mead has furnished us with some hints of this kind in his last essay on poisons at paris it has been remarked that the river seine is so full of stony corpuscles that the inhabitants there are more subject to the stone and gravel than at other places  now let us suppose what is very possible that waters may be impregnated with metallic particles of some ore or other then these according to their various gravitations the capacities of the canals or vessels and such like circumstances when they come to circulate in the human body must attract and be attracted by other particles which are already deposited either in the kidneys bladder or other secretory passages and cannot but form and as it were cement a stony substance which it is greatly to be feared will defeat all the efforts and sovereign dissolving properties of tar water itself nay much stronger medicines of which the once famed mrs stephenss are an instance  the consideration of what has been said and the idea which may be conceived of the infinite number of small ducts or secretory vessels through which this liquor must be strained ought to give us convincing demonstrations why it is as likely to procure obstructions as to remove them and consequently lay the very foundation for all chronic deseases which in my opinion must and do proceed from one and the same cause  dr lister observes that waters which pass through a clayish bottom must partake of metallic particles because clay is a mineral glebe and that these particles are not to be mastered that is they cannot be digested in the human body and therefore he concludes they cannot but cause calculous concretions in the kidneys bladder and joints if this be the case we need not wonder why insensible perspiration is obstructed by them and thus says the great sanctorius in sect   aphor   that heavy water converts the matter of transpiration into an ichor which being retained inchuces a cachexy which the learned author of tar water says  sect    is of the same kind with the scurvy proceeds from the same causes and is attended with like symptoms which are so manifold and various that the scurvy may be looked on as a general cachexy infecting the whole habit and vitiating all the digestions  from hence proceed pains in the limbs livid pustules and ulcers in the body with great inflammation from the acrimony of the obstructed ichor or perspirable matter hysterical maladies are occasioned by the same means for the said sanctorius observes in sect   aphor    that the wind so inseparable from those cases is nothing else than the fluid of perspiration crude and unfinished and a late very learned author gives us the history of a lady his relation who was very much afflicted with frequent returns of violent cholic pains till she was advised by the noble van helmont not to drink as she then did beer brewed with wellwater and soon after her health was so far owing to that management that an error in it was unavoidably followed with the usual complaint  it may be objected that all persons are not alike subject to the stone and gravel and that when water is mixed with the oily and acid particles of the ballam it may in some measure relax the vessels and by that means give liberty to the obstructed matter to recover its circulation or secretion but it must be considered that most constitutions are more or less subject to gravel as appears upon dissections and by a sandy sediment deposited in the urine at various times it must be considered too whether the attractive force of these stony particles or the relaxing or attenuating properties of tar water predominate which i should imagine considering the narrowness of the vessels or ducts etc through which it must pass whereby consequently the particles are brought more within the sphere of one another attraction must be yielded to the former especially since it is a known law in mechanics that in all bodies or particles of matter the attractive force is as their solidities and points in contact and that the attractive force is infinitely greater at the point of contact or extremely near it than at any determined distance besides it is allowed that this balsam contains an acid which incorporates with water and there must be a sulphur because there is an acid for homberg says the acid is always joined to sulphur vide siris sect     and sir isaac newton says that whatever attracts and is attracted strongly is an acid ib sect   0 the last author has also proved that acids which lay suppressed in sulphurous bodies attract earthy ones more strongly than their own from whence he accounts for fermentation etc which may be seen fully explained as it is printed in the second volume of dr harriss lexicon technicum from hence it follows that when these acid particles meet with earthy ones which abound in water they cannot but attract them and when these particles so attracted do by any motion or impulse meet with other particles of a homogeneal nature with themselves which they cannot fail to do either in the bladder kidneys or other vessels in the body then it is that they attract each other most strongly and so form obstructions in this or that vessel or duct which makes least resistance in spite of all the intermediation of the oil in tar water which bears but a small proportion to the acid or attractive force  but to return to our subject water is of so constant a service in preparing our diet as well as medicine that it may be justly said to be the vehicle of all our nourishment so that we cannot be too inquisitive into its nature and difference nor too nice in our choice of it and as it is the only menstruum of so noble a medicine as tar water it cannot be amiss to try and prove if by our art we can divest it of all its noxious qualities since we can find none without and by that means make it approach nearer to a principle when it will be fittest to join and cohere with the most subtle parts of that excellent balsam called tar  this must be resolved into the noble art of chemistry the experimental part of which can only convince us that waters may be purified so as to partake little or perhaps nothing of that noxious quality so obvious in them and i have been convinced of this by frequent repetitions of various processes performed with various glasses within these two months past which would take up too much room to insert in this place what is here said may occasion various objections especially from those at present concerned in the common preparation of tar water but i dare venture to affim if the question was put to any chemist nay to those who have only acquired a superficial knowledge in physic it would not be disputed but waters may be purified by various means to a great degree though they might still fall short of that perfection which cannot be performed effectually without the addition of a second principle which has been successfully discovered after a tedious course of experiments for distillation of water alone will not answer the purpose since after it has been distilled two or three times it will still continue to form a stony concrete in the inside of any vessel it is boiled or even simmered in and it is very easy to imagine what consequences a continued quantity may produce when strained through the fine capillary vessels in a human body which as our great author observes in sect    of his siris are said to be so small that one grain of sand would cover the mouths of more than a hundred thousand  it was observed before and it may be justly repeated that none but a chemist can so dexterously prepare this water so as to free it from what is foreign to itself consequently no person can better prognosticate what effects may proceed from its use for as our learned bishop observes from socrates sect     you and the cook may judge of a dish on the table equally well but while the dish is making the cook can better foretell what will ensue from this or that manner of composing it consequently the chemist can judge best what will ensue from this or that manner of making a medicine people addicted to censure may give out that self interest is the only motive that has induced me to publish this pamphlet because the method of refining the two principles is not recited to which i answer that the chemic province is too much invaded already by empiries and impostors and those who are dissatisfied in this point are left to their own option either to continue drinking common tar water or else apply to a chemist for the other since it is at the same time with this book published where the genuine may be had at an easy expense  and though the preference of this medicine may be imagined from the reasons already given yet i am far from disparaging or assuming the least merit due to our original and illustrious author the bishop of cloyne his excellent treatise certainly deserves the greatest applause and homage from every rank and from persons of genius and it would be folly in me to think him in the least ignorant either of theoretical or experimental part of chemistry what he has done may be more plausibly accounted for from the satisfaction he enjoyed in discovering a medicine so universal and easy in its purchase to rich and poor yet no reasons can be assigned why we may not exercise our faculties in meliorating that medicine and prove it more universal both by reason and practical experience  i shall now conclude with making some remarks upon the manner of preparing this most noble medicine which when rightly managed will justly deserve all the encomiums conferred upon it its present preparation is the most improper that can be which in some measure the bishop himself has proved by his own philosophy in several parts of his treatise for by his ordering it to be stirred with a ladle or flat stick one may suspect that he and most others hitherto have prepared it in an open vessel which must be inconsistent with all manner of philosophy he lays great stress upon its volatility its subtle oil or acid and its oily volatile vegetable salt which he says are the very flower of its specific qualities this makes it appear more strange that a medicine endowed with such fine volatile parts should be made in an open vessel unless we intended to evaporate o rob it of this volatility for he has taught us in sect    that all the finest and purest parts of any volatile very easily ascend first where then must all these fine volatile oily and subtle acid parts as he calls them go to in a vessel uncovered it ought to be our chiefest care to preserve them what is the worth of the once greatly fancied spirits of scurvigrass after they have stood forty eight hours in an open vessel sal ammoniac and salts of tartar perhaps have less volatility than either tar or water when single yet upon the least mixing them one with the other there immediately arises a volatility which affects the nose so strongly as not to be endured but though this will greatly admit of a comparison et it does not exactly solve the present problem for tar being impregnated with such subtle parts which are suppressed from flying off by reason of the viscidity of its component parts yet when it comes to be divided and as it were fluxed with such a fluid as water then all its volatile parts are disengaged and set loose from their imprisonment and cannot fail to escape according to their different degrees of purity especially if the water be refined for it is then rendered much fitter for infusion because its parts which before were gross and heavy being now made small and as it were volatile it is fitted to inlinuate itself into the most remote abscesses and there adjoin itself to the most subtle parts of the subject which before were so closely shut up in these narrow cells as to debar the entrance of more crude aqueous particles much in the manner as spirits of wine will dissolve a resinous substance sooner than water for the spirituous particles being more subtle and exceedingly smaller than those of water they can more readily enter into the interstices of the resin and easily disjoin its parts which are too closely united for the gross corpuscles of water to enter  hence it is manifest that purified water is not only incomparably better adapted to enter into the stage of circulation in human bodies but likewise more appropriated to extract a tincture from vegetables or their balsams which is the sole aim of our present business  finis
