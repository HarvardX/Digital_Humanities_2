village memoirs  village memoirs in a series of letters between a clergyman and his family in the country and his son in town  utinam veteres mores  potius majori honori hic essent quam mores mali plautus london printed for t davies in russel street covent garden mdcclxv  to the reverend mr  dear sir i have procured the letters and papers you so much wished to peruse and now present them with all due respect to you and to the public  i am rev sir with great esteem your friend and servant the editor  errata p    l   for acts ends read act ends p     l     for bourdalone read bourdaloue p     l   for  read  p     l    for ornaments was read ornament was preface reader if thou art a man of the world this book will not please thee  it was written by those who were abstracted from mankind and had little relish for either the ribaldry or amusements of the present times  mr paulet was a clergyman unknowing in the world and unknown to all but men like himself  the latter part of his life he read mankind chiefly in his study for it was his unhappy fate whenever he wished to take a wider range to experience little more than their falsehood or infidelity  his son by becoming a private tutor in town for a while afforded him frequent opportunities of hearing what follies were most predominant and from his own letters perhaps it may not be incurious to trace the decent sobriety of the character of the old english gentleman when compared with the inflated maxims of the modern indian innovator  the daughters correspondence likewise will not be totally uninstructive as it may afford some remarkable instances of the great changes that in a short time may be brought about from the prevalence of manners over laws principles and morality  it may be justly urged perhaps that mr paulet saw every thing through a contracted medium but however the mind is tempered by virtue or harmonized by religion i fear there are few good men who can survey the scenes that are continually shifting before them without acrimony or disgust  the mind of man in solitude is torpid and inactive but when cast on the ocean of life it is dissipated and infirm  restless in the pursuit of some hidden good it wears out its sensibility by perpetual motion and confined within the limits of an unextended empire it contracts itself and becomes gloomy and despondent  village memoirs to mr paulet at sir wm russells cavendishsquare dear charles we are all under the greatest anxiety about our friend and neighbor mr alrington  his disorder rages more vehemently than ever and the physicians cannot perceive one favorable symptom of his amendment  have no time to add further particulars but fear this is only a preface to worse intelligence  will write by tomorrows post  in the mean time your sister joins in all love with your affectionate father  robert paulet marleston feb         to the same dear charles at four oclock this afternoon i was again sent for not to pray by him but at my own request to pay the last tribute to expiring friendship  he had no orders to give about either his plumes or his monument  if i have lived well said he my deeds will be graven on the minds of men and i shall have the blessings of the deserving  let the poor be decently supplied on the occasion with all necessaries and if they loved me they will not wish for superfluities  i have ever been their protector and they would not i am sure convert my funeral into an hour of festivity  i feel an awe but no grief at my dissolution  some philosophers it is said have been above terrors but i fear they were below humanity  to shudder is the part of the guilty to stand undismayed is the language of the stoic to be humble is the duty of a man  before the mortification took place i had need of all my resolution but i hope in those moments i confessed virtue on the rack and suffered torture only to refine my ore from its dross  there is i am convinced of it now a counterpoise to all human misery  some hidden resource which the mind can best supply at its utmost exigency  i feel it now and should think it ill exchanged for all that titles wealth fortune or power could bestow upon me and though i am journeying apace to that undiscovered country from which i never shall return i would not wish for one hour of added life for aught but for my friends amongst whom my dearest paulet i have ever principally esteemed you  thus saying he pressed eagerly my hand looked fervently to heaven  sighed  and expired  a scene like this awakened all my feelings and for some moments i experienced an awful something without a name  tears and grief had nearly overwhelmed me but i have again recovered my tranquillity for it would ill become me to fall a victim to distress when my life and my profession demand me to make use of its instruction  i have gained by his death a trial of that fortitude which i hope i have not altogether disgraced  what i have lost you can easily recount with me  he was a man for i must ever dwell on his character who though he had experienced all the falsehood of a bad world had never steeled his heart against the feelings of humanity  he was benevolent without vanity and generous without ostentation  he had a heart perhaps too susceptible of soft impressions which ever laid him open to the designs of the artful and disingenuous so that from the superiority of his understanding he derived a weakness in his worldly conduct  he was warm in his resentments but lest he should be behind hand in reparation paid always over price  he was skilled in all the necessary truths of the religion he professed and it was no inferior branch of his knowledge that he was ever willing to remain ignorant of those deeper mysteries which its divine author thought fit to conceal from him  he was to me a patron a benefactor and a friend a friend that  but i will here close the subject entreating you my dearest charles to withdraw frequently from the busy scenes of life to contemplate the character of a man which may add fervor to virtue zeal to religion and confidence to truth  i am your affectionate father robert paulet marleston feb         to mr paulet etc dear brother for all what mr pope says  that people never want to receive letters but from london i have the vanity to think you will be glad to hear from me though confined in this gloom of solitude  we have had a sad dull winter of it my father being still quite moped for the death of poor mr arlington indeed he is a great loss to us all but we hope soon to have ample amends made us by the great man that has just purchased his estate  he came down yesterday for the first time to view it for he bought it only from the fine description that was given of it by the great auctioneer in london  his name is massem  he has a sister who is come to that time of life when you say we women begin to cast long our shadows lengthen as the sun goes down shadows  there are a mr and mrs clip who came with them two dependents and a mr layout a designer in taste in gardening and no end of servants  i have only seen them as they passed by for they stay but a day or two as miss massem says she is indispensibly engaged to go with some duchess or other to the masquerade on thursday evening next  the parish are quite delighted with their appearance but my father seems afraid that these great folks should contaminate his flock but i cannot see why they should for they say that they will be vastly good and charitable to the poor and when they are down will almost entirely maintain them without work out of their own kitchen  i thought brother you would like to hear a little how we went on and as you will pay no tax for this intelligence i could not help scribbling a few lines though it was only to assure you that i remain ever your affectionate sister  susan paulet marleston april  0      if you are not too much taken up with your new office i shall be glad to hear how you like london     to miss paulet at marleston dear sister i hope you would not suppose that either the diversions of town or the dignity of my new character as preceptor would so entirely engross my attention as to make me forget my friends  it is true this mode of life has not a little engaged both my attention and my wonder  i wonder at every thing i see and then i wonder that i should wonder at any thing  all here is one perpetual scene of tumult noise and dissipation  mankind ever in pursuit of something which when found creates more wants than it supplies  a general siege is laid against an old offender called time which though every one complains of the loss of yet every one is in league to kill it as fast as possible  the old maid at ranelagh may have hopes of making a conquest and the old matron at a rout may be enraptured with spadille  but believe me these are only secondary considerations  to kill so much time is the principal point in view  for how can the old maid experience any real pleasure from haunting those circles where she is conscious that she is considered but as the forlorn shadow of her departed beauty  or how can the old matron receive any high gratification from returning to those tables where she must reflect if she has not stifled reflection that she can only afford new specimens of the acidity of her temper and the fraudulency of her intentions  indeed she has one consolation that the troops she is engaged with are generally full as corrupt and contaminated as herself  you will say that the old can have but few prospects and amusements  it is true but they can have real ones prospects ever brightening as attraction must ever increase the nearer we approach the object  but you will now exclaim that i appear already to write from my dictatorial chair and give laws in the true style of a schoolmaster but i can never help expatiating on this subject for it is not so much the comet itself as the tail of that comet that i am so much in care for  there is always some expecting niece or entrusted cousin who to be kept out of harms way must be the watchful sentinel to all this scene of disorder  good heavens as if the mind could be more in harms way or more dissipated than by sitting seven hours attendant on a cardtable now and then admiring work perhaps indulged by introducing her knotting and storing her mind for to read would be ill manners with those remarks only that avarice ignorance and ill humor are continually suggesting  and what are the fruits of this miserable farrago every days experience too fatally evinces  you think i wish to deter you from coming here  indeed i do  for though the country i fear affords frequently no better examples yet it is impossible to drive quite so fast on crossroads as it is on a turnpike and there are numbers who can keep themselves afloat on a gentle stream whose strength is yet utterly insufficient to stem a torrent  i do not doubt either the goodness of your heart or the firmness of your intentions but remember the wisest and the best have found the inefficacy of reason against worldly seduction  nor do i mean to stifle a generous endeavor or preclude that trial which is appointed to virtue  i know both their value and reward  but consider  true courage consists in combating an enemy nobly that attacks you  it is the part of a bravado only to be affiduous for a contest  i see i have run out my letter to an unconscionable length so conclude myself abruptly with duty to my father  your affectionate brother charles paulet cavendishsquare april  0       to mr paulet etc honnurd sir hoping as how your honnur will excuse my bouldnes i truble your honnur to tell you that i have lit of a mishap and am afeard my old measter should know ont  i have sr for a long time been after one jane felly the weelrites dawter and now sir she wants to be married to me seeing as how shes in a full condition for it  to be sure sir i have savd a little monney in sarvice and if your honnur would but be so good as to get her a place in london if it was near such a bad one i think the thing might be soon hushd up  i dont at all mind what a place it is seeing as how it is for nothing but a kiver indeed the worser the better as they say as it is only for a time  i have no friend on earth to ply to but your honnur and indeed i need not have one more cleverer for this or any thing else if your honnur would but be so kind as to sarve me int and say nothing ont to my old measter  so hoping for your goodness i am your dutiful sarvant  to command john cuttle marlston apr          to the revd mr paulet at marleston dear father i now sit down to give you some account of the pupil who is entrusted to my care  he is a young man of rank and fortune and not totally devoid of literary seize  for a short time he has been at westminster school but as too frequently is the case has been so much taken off by the diversions of the town that it was well if in the course of the week the masters were able to remove that love of dissipation which the young man had imbibed the preceding days of it  however before i came to him he could tolerably construe some of the easier classics and he is by no means deficient in point of natural abilities  by the death of his mother he is now committed to the care of an uncle who for a year and a half has placed him under my direction  what my mediocrity shall be able to impart i know not but attention will not be wanting and i have a father ever able and willing to supply all my deficiencies  my present endeavor is to improve his taste by furnishing his mind with the best criticisms on ancient literature such as warburtons on the  th book of virgil and hurds on the art of poetry  by the aid of these books i perceive his mind to be wonderfully enlarged and he has already remarked that the fame of the commentators ought nearly to equal the glory of their respective authors  from hence you will gather that he has feeling which in preference to every other consideration ought principally to be improved  he has just asked my opinion of the ramblers which says he i find are generally considered as pompous and pedantic  i tell him that the ramblers are my manuals and i can more properly apply the words of bishop burnet to them than to any other modern productions that they are the storehouse of all moral virtues  i fear he thinks i have strong prejudices for he often observes that the world speaks quite otherwise  as to the world i tell him there are but few who are capable of judging  those that are either through envy or other malignant passions will rarely do justice to living authors  johnson would be more read was his matter as thinly spread as in other periodical publications  then he has written on party subjects and this can never be forgiven by his vanquished opponents  warburton is not less obnoxious on the same account  indeed so far i will accede  that the one by long dealing in words has too much increased the vocabulary and the other by dealing too much with mankind has at length exceeded the decent limits of all sober satire  but truth and virtue were their guides and whilst these remain in the world such authors will ever be considered as their brightest ornaments  an old gentleman was by chance present at this dialogue between my pupil and me who hastily exclaimed good god sir why i never heard a syllable of all this in regard to either of them and i have resided the greatest part of my life the bishop of gloucester lived at prior park near bath and the author of the ramblers in johnsons court fleet street editor at bath except two months that i lived with my brother in fleet street  i am etc c paulet cavendishsquare april          to mr paulet etc honnurd sir not hearing from your honnur so soon as was expected we hope now that you will know nothing of the matter for we have gotten a lisense and are married and all is well again  she thinks she shant be lighted of near three months and thats longer by two than her mother was and by all three than almost any other woman in the parish  i am afeared of nobody saying ought about the matter but my old measter but you know sr he is very partickler this way  but if he should sir i must tell him that neighbor snarles wife was churchd and married and the child cristned and all the same day and thof to be sure my old measter made a bogle ont yet you know he was bligd to do it after all and the child for ought i can see was born in as good wedlock as mine will be  howsomever i must do as well as i can by her now and hope god will prosper my honest endeavors thof to be sure i should be sorry if my old measter was disobliged by it  i am your dutiful sarvant to command john cuttle marleston may         to john cuttle at marleston john to little purpose has my father explained to you the duties of religion both in and out of church if at your time of life you have made no better use of them  though you ought not to desert the creature you have debauched yet there can be little prospect of happiness where the foundation is laid in iniquity  it is not a number of bad people in a parish that can sanctify a bad action and whatever may be the opinion of your neighbors that will not or ought not at least to lighten the burden of your own conscience  what you have done is in open violation of your duty and in express disobedience to the laws of your god  you and your guilty partner must repent of your errors and where you may have little hopes from the justice of the almighty through his mercy you may have full assurance of pardon  i wish you well and subscribe myself your friend c paulet cavendishsquare may         to mr paulet etc to day i have paid a visit for the first time to our great neighbors  oh charles  such a visit  i was accosted with  so dr i reckon you would be glad to wet your throat after talking so long to your parish  pray be free and call for any thing you like here  you need not stand mearlymouthed as if you was with some of your halfstarved country squires  call about you man says he  we dont cupboard the bottoms of the bottles here  why egad my servants in the kitchen live grander than all the gentry hereabouts put together  gentry  says miss massem  rabble you mean brother  i only replied that i rarely drank wine in an afternoon  the conversation then chiefly ran on their own grandeur and the ignorance and poverty of their neighbors  after tea  mr layout favored us with remarks on taste in gardening alas how different from poor mr arlingtons which by the bye i shall select for you from his papers and miss massem insisted on my looking at her trou madame table for though she knew she said that i would not be so wicked as to play of a sunday yet she declared that i should look at it  i told her that i supposed it might be as innocent as any other game but that i thought the sabbath might be full as well enployed  ay but how dr says the squire  for there is no visiting hereabouts and we never go to church though in compliment to you we shall always send the servants  i hoped they would come from a better motive  ay ay says he those sort of people like to show their best clothes  mr layout observed that sunday was only fit to travel on and miss massem added that at best it could only be considered as a horrid bore  i would have it now says the nabob as in foreign parts all life and jollity and dancing and not keep it as they do here just as thof it was a fast  perhaps sir said i if limitations could be set to amusements it might be an improvement  proper recreations are as necessary for the mind as the body and when seasoned with temperance keep both in equal harmony but the misfortune is that where no line could be drawn people would soon go from the fields to a playhouse from the playhouse to a rout and from a rout to a masquerate  well says miss massem and suppose they did it would be much better i think than to stay at home and be all out of humor with one another  i certainly agreed with her that it would if that must be the necessary consequence  this short dialogue throws a strong light on their respective characters and when i consider what a total change such a family may bring about in a village i reason upwards and look with horror on an infected kingdom  if time and reflection can work any improvement i shall gradually inculcate better notions at present it is in vain to attempt to sow good principles in a soil not formed for their reception  your sister joins in all love with  your affectionate father robert paulet marleston may        pray write oftener for old folks though they are thrown out of the world love to hear what is doing in it     to mr paulet etc dear brother though my father seems to dislike this new family and to be sure they have some odd ways with them yet upon the whole they are vastly agreeable  miss massem has taken great notice of me and was so kind as to send for me the other evening to make up a dance  yesterday she took me with them to return sir john oldburys visit  oh lord they are so queer and so formal  to be sure we laughed immoderately all dinnertime  miss massem declared that if every thing had not been as awkward as it was she should never have refrained at the sight of poor sir johns periwig to say nothing of his antiquated wife and his two full blown daughters  to be sure miss massem said they meant to be very civil but they were almost too bad to visit however as they were her nearest neighbors she would always endeavor to make an annual sacrifice  as to mr massem he said it was much the same what places he visited at for most of our country gentry kept such bad cooks that he should always be obliged to get away as soon as possible that he might make an early supper  and for the future if he must visit sir john he should always go out of principle on an ash wednesday  however they know nothing of all this and if they did not see us laugh i believe took the visit very kind and friendly  i am your affectionate sister susan paulet marleston may  0      at the ball i had the honor to dance with captain glanville who is reckoned one of the finest gentlemen in england he was most excessively complaisant to me though all the other ladies in the room were much my superiors     to miss paulet dear sister i thank you for every remembrance of me  but if you will not take it quite ill i must rally you a little about day visiting  to be sure it is considered as a mark of friendship and esteem but i believe in general that it proceeds from little more than a love of dissipation or to gratify an idle curiosity  i remember paying a visit of the sort you speak of and could not help reflecting how little amusement there could be either to the entertainers or the entertainees  those who are to entertain are anxious for the dignity or propriety of the treat and where there is much anxiety there can be little or no comfort  then if any awkward circumstances should occur as the world now goes they know they will be the talk of the whole neighborhood and where servants are not always in trammels some will spill the beer and others trample on your favorite lapdog  on the other hand those who are to be entertained as soon as they have swallowed their dinners talked of the wine the weather and the roads  heard perhaps that sir john strictlys hares are all snared or that dr meanwell has got into a fresh dispute about tithes  are absolutely told that the coach is at the door  this is all the regalement unless perchance the ladies at tea have just had time enough to inform them that the drs daughters are grown as fat as porpoises  nothing more is to be done but to pack up  recall the coachman who has just stepped back for one more draught of ale  to express great satisfaction for the entertainment they have received  hope that the family will return the visit as soon as possible which will make them most inexpressibly happy and lo the last lagging footman is just come out to take his horse  well  all ceremonies are now passed  and as they are safely out of hearing it is high time to turn every thing into ridicule or to recount the miseries of the day  to think says one lady of all the trouble i had with my hair and to see no more company  but that is always the case whenever i am well dressed  the next time i declare i will visit in my nightcap  lord says another i knew very well what the visit would turn out and put on a last years negligee on purpose  however we have certainly been of use to them  we have aired their plate reviewed their footmen and thinned their poultryyard  thus the badness of the roads is beguiled with low sneers and petty detraction till the party congratulate one another on their safe return to their own home  for awhile they sit moped  discontented  call for the cardtable one hates whist and another abominates quadrille are all killed with the fatigues of the day but as home is of all places the worst a servant is immediately dispatched to poor old lady humdrums to acquaint her that they will do themselves the honor of waiting upon her ladyship on the morrow  thus is life wasted without either profit or amusement and people presume to thank their stars that they can lead useful and rational lives whilst mr pedant is poring over his books and mrs conserve is employed in writing out new receipts to preserve apricots  i am etc etc charles paulet cavendishsquare may          to mr paulet dear charles my time of late has been much taken up in assisting the executors to settle mr arlingtons affairs  we now find that from the very advantageous sale of the estate after paying off all the debts there will be something left very considerable for his relations  a circumstance which could he have known poor man would have greatly contributed to have brightened up the evening of his days  but to wave this melancholy subject  so ignorant charles was i of the world that i did not know it was one great instance of politeness to go up to town only just to come down again and that with such rapidity that a bystander might fancy that the national welfare depended on their speed  we have now brought down with us i assure you as part of our retinue a domestic chaplain mr pliant  so silken so supple and so complying that i could almost fancy him to say to his patron  is it your pleasure sir to believe in god  he is i find on enquiry a distant relation and seems thoroughly broke in to the office he is to fill  yesterday as i was returning from my usual ride i met him like justice overdo in the comedy in quest of enormities and we really enjoyed a very pretty kind of a chitchat till at length some how or other i dropped out something about servilities  servilities says he now i reckon you think that i am forced to submit to some servilities as you call them  no sir let me tell you my mode of life is perfectly agreeable to me  mr massem keeps a good table has the choicest liquors  and though your country hereabouts to be sure is dull enough yet we have always company in the house to pass away the time with  and as for business i have nothing to do but to dust the books  clean the birdcages and now and then make rebusses for the ladies  indeed if we had not some amusements amongst ourselves it would be dull enough here for i have been sauntering about says he for these two hours and cannot meet with any one thing worthy the least observation  surely says i sir nature to a mind capable of reflection like yours every where presents a fund of entertainment  to a man who knows how to take a ride this blade of grass or this declining hill affords an infinite scope for contemplation  in this sequestered scene methinks i could say with shakespeare that i  find tongues in trees books in the running brooks sermons in stones and good in every thing but if this retired prospect delights you not i will return with you to the top of the hill and present you with an object that may call forth all your attention  that is at once a cure for pride and a lecture to ambition that reminds philosophy of its true end and makes none but the ignorant tremble to behold it  it leads the languid to hope allays the the thirst of avarice and places wealth on its true foundation  to you and me sir it may be the vehicle to happiness a car more triumphant than ever graced the conquests of a caesar or an alexander  good god sir says my companion what can you mean  i can see nothing but a hearse  in short charles as i found the present delighted him not i thought it by no means unfair to raise his prospect to futurity  i am dear charles etc etc robert paulet marleston june         to mr paulet etc dear father i intended by todays post to have sent you a string of political reports with some large extracts from speeches said to have been lately made in the house of commons but as i find the former are nothing but reports and the latter like dying confessions were printed beforehand i now sit down with an absolute determination to give you nothing but the truth  the grand vehicle of business in this metropolis appears to me to be a lie  it rises in the morning with the watchman bawling out  half an hour past eleven oclock and accompanies the prentice home who pulls out his watch with great eagerness to convince his master that it has not yet struck twelve  through the regions of darkness its operations perhaps are better supposed than described for it stands not unveiled in open daylight till it is circulated through the strand by paragraphs postcripts letters and advertisements  fame in the shape of a newscarrier sounding the trumpet before it  by its aid the tradesman and his wife are enabled to drink their coffee and by its aid the tradesman and his wife are enabled to drink that coffee comfortably for scandal like irreligion gives a relish to many enjoyments  but now the whole city is in a ferment for there its mornings are monopolized and it is exchanged and brokered about to greater or less advantage from its different degrees of sanctity in great wigs and its more or less solemnity in city faces  indeed it is never a moment unemployed there but at dinnertime when it steals away to meet the statesman on his return from the gamingtable or the stews  with him it holds a levee where it is decked in smiles and graces  what it has lost in weight it has gained in politeness  and lends to expectation even the confidence of success  the veil indeed is never taken off for the promiser gives a hundred to strengthen one till time alone convinces you of the uncertainty of a future day  you now plead loudly for admittance but tomorrow is called in to the jugglers aid for this afternoon he is engaged to vote against the articles and at night he must negociate with a jew ere he dares to show his face again before the waiter at almacks  but his servants perhaps are townbred and are taught to descry want and necessity by intuition  lying is their professed science for what mischiefs might not ensue if through ignorance a stranger should be let in to see a patriot barter his integrity or a fair one her reputation and her virtue  if mistakes like these should arise honor must be called in as a safeguard here as goodness is the security of the city  but the evening advances and it is now sold wholesale at theaters lectureshops and all other places of public diversion  like scrub it may be said to be of all professions  one day it drives the coach another it drives the plough another it draws warrants and another it draws beer  it seems to be the desideratum of the philosopher for it operates universally from the speech that is administered at noonday to the dark slander that is only launching into whisperhood  the poet relies upon it for his dinner and the politician for his pay  the divine  but hold  here it can be of no use except now and then to explain a text  till it openly stands confessed and by a nolo episcopari becomes a passport to a bishopric  in short where is it not of use except in the uncontrouled intercourse between a tender and indulgent father and an ever dutiful and affectionate son  i am etc c paulet   to mr paulet etc dear brother i am so angry at your last letter that i could almost resolve not to write to you any more  i told miss massem some of your remarks on dayvisiting and she says that if you give into a way of being so severe you will never be a favorite amongst the ladies  besides brother i receive so many civilities from this family that i should tax myself with the height of ingratitude if i endeavored to give you an opportunity of turning their foibles into ridicule  however as i dare not trust you with my own remarks i have at my fathers request transcribed some of mr arlingtons which i doubt not but you will find both valuable and entertaining  the next opportunity he has of conveying a packet too large for the post he will send you according to promise strictures on landscape gardening  i am etc susan paulet july  d marleston remarks from the late mr arlingtons papers i men are frequently most desirous of talking on those subjects they least understand  for the same reason perhaps as ladies at ninetynine affect to have the toothache ii addison a man of great judgment in other branches of literature is scarce ever right when he criticizes the old english language iii no man can properly criticize milton who has not carefully studied euripides mr arlington here probably alludes to sampson agoniftes many passages of which appear evidently to be borrowed from thence  iv there ought to be an act of parliament against burying authors of eminence under their own ruins  swift will soon be an example of this v it has been objected against studying thucydides that he wrote a large folio comprising only a very short period  the time indeed is short but the writer made ample amends by the force of his descriptions and the sublimity of his style  and it is a sufficient encomium perhaps to say that he was studied by demosthenes and imitated by sallust vi mr popes essay on man is certainly a very masterly performance in point of poetry but the philosophy contained in it is flimsy and unconnected vii stern will be immortal when rabelais and cervantes are forgot  they drew their characters from the particular genius of the times  stern confined himself to nature only viii till my uncle toby appeared i had used to assert that no character was ever better drawn than that of sir roger de coverly ix a man may as well

mirror of former prejudices xii i have frequently thought that the duty of visiting the sick should not be vested in the priest for who knows but the constant sights of dying persons may in time render their hearts like those of butchers and surgeons callous and void of humanity xiii a man by swearing may draw down a curse upon himself but never one upon his neighbor xiv it is said by tacitus that men lose their respect for you in proportion to the favors you bestow  but as few perhaps know how to give with delicacy as others to receive with proper gratitude xv the parliament of england is formed in a manner not totally dissimilar from that of the ancient council of the general attention of this assembly and the invariable object of all its modellers and directors was to form a complete representative of all greece as the good of each individual was subservient to that of his community so the good of each community was considered as subordinate to that of the whole nation their  was the man who considered himself as a member of the state who submitted his conduct to the laws who acted entirely under their direction who gained popularity not by flattering the people but by procuring their good on the other hand the inhabitants did not confine their regards to their own private affairs they did not consider public difficulties merely as they affected their own tranquillity or that of their families they were taught to regard their country as a common mother to whom they belonged no less than to their natural parents while these principles preserved their due vigor and influence greece continued a really united body happy in itself and formidable to its enemies but as soon as the nation began to degenerate its representative of course shared in the corruption  and this degeneracy increased so fast that at length we read the most of those who were deputed to fit in this once famous council of amphictyons were so corrupt that they even came prepared to earn the wages of iniquity  to devote themselves entirely to the service of the crafty and the enterprising who could pay them most liberally without regard to their own honor the interest

it would be one of the most melancholy hours of my life if i could suppose myself capable of giving you any just grounds of offense  that you might not be caught with the glare of falsehood instead of reality i have ever endeavored to give you all the caution in my power  far would i be from debarring you of the least pleasures that are reasonable but wish you only to be moderate in the pursuit of them  if caution of every kind comes not best from a brother from whom can it come he can have no interest but yours nor any struggle or competition but who shall make most happy the tenderest and most affectionate of parents  but i will not suffer myself to suppose that you have ever felt the least resentment  on all subjects let me speak the free sentiments of my heart as you must ever be convinced of my utmost sincerity and affection  i am etc c paulet ps pray tell my father that in his next i hope to receive his permission for my going into orders that as soon as possible i may alleviate the burden of those expenses which have already i fear fallen too heavy upon him     to mr paulet etc dear brother i received your last kind letter and now sit down to give you some little account of the jaunt i have just taken with my good friends into derbyshire  my father for a long time was against my going but miss massem did every thing in her power to teaze him into it  at derby we saw the silk mills and what i liked much better the new assembly room and the china manufactory but we staid there only a short time for there was a low family who found out mr massem and was exceedingly troublesome and impertinent to him so in the evening we went to kedleston where we had a very tolerable dance  next day we saw lord scarsdales which is very fine to be sure but miss massem found great fault with the furniture of the house and mr layout who was with us allowed no part of the garden ground to be disposed in taste  mr massem admired nothing but the large pillars and captain glanville thought there was a great deal of idle money thrown away upon the library  as for myself i liked every thing but particularly the sideboard  from kedleston we went to matlock which if it was not for the company would if possible be ten times more dismal than marleston  however we danced and went upon the water with music and drank tea at the boat house and upon the whole passed our time very agreably  from thence we went to chatsworth  it proved a most charming day and we were all enraptured with the waterworks  in some places cataracts of water fall down stairs twenty yards deep and in others the water is forced up into the air to the most incredible height to say nothing of the artificial tree which would have sprinkled us all over from its leaves if it had not been out of order  from chatsworth we went to buxton where we joined parties with lord canvass and dr and mrs grudgens  at first they took no notice of us but as soon as they found out who mr massem was they were particularly complaisant and civil  my lord is most exceedingly engaging  but dr grudgens talks of nothing but eating and preferment  and then so suspicious that in a morning when he played at allfours with captain glanville if the hand was not out before the bell rung he was sure to keep the cards in his pocket all the while he knelt down to say his prayers  indeed prayers here are merely made a farce of  for people laugh and whisper the whole time  though it would not signify much if they did not for what with the howling of dogs the bawling of footmen and the giggling of ladies maids in the passages it would be utterly impossible to hear one syllable that the parson said  poor man  i was really quite sorry for him and my father would have been absolutely shocked for the company had used to pay him more or less just as they won or lost at cards  indeed i thought he seemed to have no advantage but that of saying grace at the head of the table whilst the ladies were fighting for the wings of the chickens  but i must tell you one circumstance that happened about mrs grudgens  one day she was very busy in carving an immense goose that stood before her when captain glanville desired her next neighbor to help him to some apple pie  mrs grudgens with all the good nature in the world came immediately out of the goose and plunged directly into the pie  to be sure she was elbowdeep in sage and onion  and the captain was so unlucky for he is a man of vast wit as to set all the company into a loud laugh by calling out  for heavens sake madam stop  i asked for apple pie  i did not mean a medley one  whether you are at all entertained with my letter or not you will see at least that my resentments are of no long continuance  and that i am as much as ever  your affectionate sister susan paulet   to mr paulet etc dear charles i must still think you too young to go into orders  i may be particular in my notions perhaps  but i will cheerfully streighten my own circumstances to approve my sincerity  it has been well observed that young men are apt to mistake the completion of their academic courses for the completion of their theologic studies  a mistake which inclines them to aspire to teach others seeing the rather as st paul expresses it that they ought to be taught themselves  those who are appointed to explain the oracles of god should have attended to them most particularly  otherwise they may soon be caught in the delusive snares of modern infidelity or wax old in the pernicious system of not changing the posture of defense and of keeping to strong holds  and i am sorry to observe that true religion has nearly suffered as much from the one as from the other  our savior perhaps has confined the practice of our duty within the limits of his own sermon on the mount nevertheless as a divine it will be required that you should be able to give a rational account of the faith that is in you  a rational and a cautious one let it always be for the scriptures in the hands of controvertists have generally been wrested to the most infamous purposes  each man insisting on that being irreligion which was only not consonant to his own prejudices  st augustine i know asserts that dictum est tamen  non ut aliquid diceretur sed ne taceretur aug de trin lib vc  when any enquiry is made it is not necessary that you should say any thing to the purpose but well or ill that you should always keep talking  but none but such a saint would have said it and this very assertion with me would invalidate his whole authority  in regard to studying the fathers in general i can only say that i hope they were sincere but by their strange interpretations to say no worse of them they have opened a door to ridicule and from their absurdities modern infidels have sought occasion to undermine the main fabric of religion itself what can be said in excuse for writers where some endeavor to prove that it was necessary there should be only quatuor quoniam quatuor sunt parts orbis terrae etc aug de cons evang lib i  it vid iren lib iiic   theophyl prooem in matthew four evangelists because there were only four elements four climates four cardinal winds and four cardinal virtues and others si filius sederet ad dextram pater sederet ad sinistram  that christ could not ascend to sit at the right hand of god for if he sat at the right god himself must sit at the left  these are not merely the testimonies that voltaire rousseau or even dr middleton may bear against them but the more certain testimony that they bear against themselves  from what i have said therefore think no scorn to trace the causes of their mistakes but by no means presume to determine essentials on their fallacious authority and let me require you never to raise scruples in the minds of well disposed people under the pretense of preaching against infidelity for if your arguments are ever so cogent you cannot strike at any great number for very few infidels will ever be your hearers  and there is no such thing as a sect of freethinkers  it is just as ridiculous as dr bentley observes phil lips  as to talk of a rope of sand  and let me particularly enjoin you never to take up ill opinions of or denounce against any man merely on account of his sect or party  for as our savior says in his fathers house there are many mansions so i have no doubt but there are many ways that may lead to them  enthusiasm is the growth of a narrow mind and a heated imagination infidelity is the result of false reasoning and a wicked biass  from the former we are empowered to believe a solid system of old wives stories and from the latter that though the history be ever so authentic we ought never to believe at all  whatever may be their difference in another world in this they equally tend to gloom madness and desperation  by not calling in our reason we debase the religion we profess and by calling in too much we are apt to invalidate faith reject revelation and then our minds will extravagate through all the wilds of error and absurdity  i am ever your affectionate father robert paulet ps in regard to the present dispute about the articles my own opinion is that no other test should be required than the apostles creed but this opinion is not orthodox     to mr paulet etc dear father i am just returned from sadlers wells which does not only lower my idea of the times but even of human nature  i do not so much reflect on the entertainment itself as it is called as on the cruel means that must have been made use of before the managers could have procured so dreadful an exhibition  whence can arise the pleasure of seeing children suspended in the air or tossed about at the utmost hazard of their lives to gratify the avarice of unnatural parents but indeed the country affords almost as strong instances of cruelty as town for wrestling singlestick or even football are never considered as diversions by the common people but as attended with danger mischief or bloodshed  but in town what shocks me most is that continual flocking to executions  in the country from the less frequency of them even butchers weep but here they are accounted the next diversions to sadlers wells and by use men can see a monkey dangling from a wire or a fellow creature expiring at the gallows with equal unconcern  how much care therefore should be taken to inculcate the principles of humanity in youth a term which in general i believe is mistaken for cowardice how little care indeed is taken even amongst the higher ranks of people who suffer their children unmercifully to treat the whole brutecreation and then wonder that in time they become cruel enemies and undutiful children  they think not how early these inhuman principles are imbibed they begin indeed in infancy only with torturing flies but they end in delighting to view the most horrid murders of the inquisition  at other places of great resort a dog shows you what it is oclock bears dance minuets and sparrows countrydances but such exhibitions ought not to be allowed in a civilized country for no valuable discoveries are likely to be made from them that can any ways atone for the tortures which the birds or animals must experience in the training  you find i am desirous of seeing every thing once and giving you my free thoughts as they flow without staying to marshal them in any order i return you my best thanks for the kind advice contained in your last  and wish to receive more hints on the same subject   remain etc charles paulet   to mr paulet etc dear charles the alterations already made at marleston are so great that i hardly know my own village  mr massem every day makes purchases of ground no matter at what expense that mr layout may at least acknowledge he has scope enough for his invention i hear of nothing but obelisks statues gazebos terminations and a laurelbelt  they talk of taste just as if it was to be brought down in a broadwheeled wagon and they had nothing to do but to scatter it at random  mr layout thinks there should be a clump and there is one the squire thinks it would look pretty to cut a vista through it and it is cut and his sister thinks she should like a dairyhouse near the spot and she builds it  so that at last it will be an olio a christmas pie a solomon gundy or perhaps a fools coat  i must own it rather grieves me to find that the grove on the right hand where the rustic seat was with the motto of hae latebrae dulces and si jam credis amoenae should be condemned to be cut down as well as the large one which mr arlington had used to call shenstones grove for the urn to his memory was prettily executed and the placing of the statue of the sibyl in front of it which seemed to exclaim procul o procul este profani was in my opinion a very happy thought  however they are all to be swept away to make room as the squire informs me for a fine mercury with his quiver and a hercules with his trident  i fear some how or other these latin mottoes have called down vengeance on the groves themselves for i am sure that neither he nor his chaplain can construe them  instead of these venerable shades a paltry shrubbery is to be planted which is to be decorated as the squire would say with all the monsters of the internal world  by what i see of the intended alterations of the water it is destined to take any course but its own for the merit of every thing seems to consist only in the sum it is to cost  where the genius of the place is attended to i am as much delighted as any man with modern improvements  but where expense is only considered or mistaken as another name for real taste i feel so much disgust that i turn away my eyes from false ornament to contemplate nature herself in a simple farm unbrokein upon by a mr layout  mr massem has not only qualified himself to act as a justice of the peace but has likewise bought a seat in parliament  from this latter acquisition to his dignity he will be enabled to do very little good or harm but from the former where some preparation is necessary much mischief may accrue to the neighborhood if he should prove as i fear will be the case a law unto himself  indeed i am far from wishing to circumscribe the power of a justice for very few are willing to act as it is without pecuniary advantages  and this i partly attribute to the great increase of attorneys  these sinful men in the flesh as the quakers call them have stopped the free course of justice and turned that food which ought to have proved our nourishment and support into a disease  what could be his motive for going into parliament  except the honor on it i did not foresee but miss massem informs me that this will account for his civility in bowing to many of the shabbylooking people that he meets with in the streets of london  he may now call them his constituents but i believe in reality they are no other than his own poor relations  oh charles this miss massem is i fear a woman of bad principles and though she is particularly kind and attentive to my daughter yet i heartily wish the girl had never been introduced to her  she is artful in her conduct violent in her prejudices and made up of passions  her friends pretend to excuse her by saying that she cannot curb herself and that she is always the same before every body but i should be apt to add except her brother from whom she has large expectations so that you see the god of wealth has infinitely more influence over her than the god of heaven  there is a captain continually with her whom i utterly detest but of him more hereafter  ps mr massem has just been with me and told me the price of his seat and i agree with him that he has bought in very dear for the stocks on that exchange are soon likely to fall  all your letters give me pleasure so pray write as often as you can  your sister joins in all love with your affectionate father  robert paulet marleston  to mr paulet etc dear brother mr massems family intend to go to town immediately after christmas to stay only a very short time and they have been so kind as to offer to take me with them and bear all my expenses  this is a favor that i had no right in the world to expect from them but great as it is i fear i shall not be able to accept it unless you brother will be so good as to throw in your interest with my father  miss massem has lain at him continually but let her say what she will he seems to have no inclination but to mew me up at marleston  whenever i urge any thing of the necessity of my seeing more of the world he always says he does not wish it  that he had much rather see me married to a good man than a great one and i believe he is as likely to meet with the one as the other in this neighborhood unless he can persuade poor old dr snore to make an offer or the ever amiable and charming master patty pipkin but perhaps he aspires so high as to think i may marry squire homebrewd or parson poacher  if i should be honored with the first my employment would be i suppose to make tea all day long to settle his stomach and if i take the other i should be constantly engaged in packing up hampers of hares and partridges to send to town to be exchanged by his correspondents for oysters and brandy  my father seriously i believe means all for my good but i am every day more and more convinced that his not knowing the world will be my greatest misfortune for i am sure marlestone is not the place if a woman as miss massem says is intended to make the most of herself in short brother all my comfort this winter depends upon you for there is nobody else can persuade my father if you cannot and you must have a poor opinion indeed of me if you think both my safety and my prudence are at stake because i shall chance to breathe for a week or two the air of london  let me hope soon to feel the effects of such a letter as you can write if you please which will ever confer a most lasting obligation on your affectionate sister  susan paulet marleston  to miss paulet etc dear sister by all the affection i bear you let me entreat you not to urge this london journey too far  my father is convinced that it is absolutely improper or he never would deny you and i think you could not enjoy pleasures abroad that must be purchased with uneasiness at home  perhaps he wishes not to receive such obligations or perhaps he thinks that it will throw you into a mode of life not calculated to promote your real happiness  whatever are his objections i should think his sentiments should be the rule of your conduct in regard to women making the most of themselves miss massem has borrowed that idea from her brother who has been used in india to make such purchases at a public market and indeed if the plan was as openly avowed here in my mind it would make but very little difference  for what is running from plays to concerts from concerts to routs and from routs to the pantheon but being equally exposed to sale at a public market  and what is the preparation to it but the vilest prostitution of time reason and tranquillity  the mornings are passed in selecting ornaments and the conquests of the evening depend on the skill of the hairdresser in adjusting them  how important he is considered can only be known by seeing the disappointment vexation and uneasiness that are occasioned when after two hours waiting the fatal message is brought that he cannot possibly wait on the lady till next day  and what are the conquests after all that are to be made here  of men perhaps chagrined at having lost their last guinea or of fops who have found out a new way to trim their frocks or tie their neckloths  alas these men are too much taken up with themselves to be sufficiently attentive to the ladies and the wise have long since known that where a womans darling passion is vanity the first fruits of marriage can only be a divorce  i have been obliged to speak out but i make no apology for i am certain that your future welfare depends entirely on your present caution  i am with more sincerity than complaisance  your most affectionate brother charles paulet cavendish square  to mr paulet etc dear father all the diversions i see here contribute to lower my respect for the public  whether the national capacity is weakened or whether the increasing numbers of the idle and the vain make it no longer necessary to consult propriety in entertainments i know not but certain i am that the taste of the town is as depraved as its principles  it was a complaint made some years ago that our operas were disgraced with the lowest insipidity of composition and singsong and that there was nothing to be admired but the mere tricks of the performers  this must always be the case in a nation where a fiddler is more estimated than a composer but now the times are so far altered that neither the fiddler nor the music are attended to at all  if the eye is pleased the ear and understanding are supposed to be gratified of course  those who chiefly frequent operas gape out this part of the performance and wake not till they are caught up with raptures at the unmeaning strut of a celebrated dancer  translations of that miserable dialogue which were heretofore thought only fit to be set to music are now received at the theaters with the greatest applause under the appellation mr paulet surely forgets the west indian which is undoubtedly one of the best comedies in the language editor of comedy  bewilder only the attention with a quick succession of incidents and scotticisms french jargon and irish blunders in short a babel of languages are sure to supply all deficiencies of wit and humor  in regard to tragedies  those that i have seen are merely indebted to the quackery of a manager for their success indeed most of them appear to be made by the same receipt  the ingredients are a tyrant a marriage incest murder and a triumph the poetry once thought essential now seems to make the least part of the production  a scheme is laid between a manager a painter an author and a sceneshifter to fabricate a new piece  the action must be laid in a part of the world that will best suit the scenery of the house for by a little dexterity in the painter the figure of a colossus may be easily changed into an egyptian idol  the next step is to consult the strength of the house in regard to the performers  as there are no tolerable men the lady must recite at least half the play  they have an old man that can make a shift to whine out a small part a roaring tyrant and a d  m your blood lover and then the sceneshifters may supply the rest  whilst the work is perfecting the public is informed by the newspapers that a gentleman of distinguished abilities now abroad will soon favor the town with a new tragedy  the first night of the performance the house is crowded in every corner of it for mankind are not in quest of what is good but of any hash that they mistake to be a new one  the curtain rises to soft music the lady makes vows at the altar the tyrant and his trumpets alarm her  she faints and is ordered to be married  a hermit secrets her from the tyrant  discovers himself to be her father the lover finds out the hermitage and the second acts ends with their embraces  they must then embrace no more  he is her brother  she flies from him to an altar or a tomb this makes variety in the puppetshow  the tyrant sees her and would absolutely bear her off but she is rescued by her brother  in the fourth act her brother is seized by the tyrants guards  is imprisoned  she visits him  the guards drag her from her brother to the tyrant  he then resolves instantly to marry her  she screams and the hermit bursts in and promises to make an important discovery if he will only delay the nuptials  the tyrant still persists  his guards seize the hermit  she rages prays and goes mad  the noise increases and the theater is drowned with tears  expectation is now big for the fifth act  what a scene of distress  she is absolutely forced to the altar but there rather than marry the tyrant the murderer of her race she recovers her senses and murders him herself  the guards take no notice of the matter and the house applauds her for near a quarter of an hour  the hermit then declares that her lover is not her brother but a young prince whom he has educated and therefore with great piety gives his blessing on their nuptials  all then is joy and exultation  and thus agreeable to all the rules of tragedy ends this miserable happy catastrophe  some half dozen in the theater perhaps may be rather discontented but to keep them in humor a favorite actress takes off their attention from the play by giving them the news of the town by way of epilogue  this may not be the exact drama but sethona which i have just now seen is if possible much more ridiculous and inconsistent  i am ever etc charles paulet ps the author of sethona has sacrificed his own better judgment in compliance with the taste of the town  his tragedy of zingis has infinite merit and his history of hindostan intitles him to a high rank amongst the learned and ingenious     to mr paulet etc dear brother mr massems family have been some time in town and i begin to think it full as well that i am left behind however i shall always submit my solicitudes to the prudence of my friends  my father has been very kind in paying off all my expenses on my derbyshire tour though mr massem was very much against it and he says that as soon as ever he thinks it expedient he will give me leave to take another journey  do not think ill of me for the over anxiety i have shown about this but rather view me with an eye of pity for though i share the caution of a father and the affection of a brother yet deprived of a mothers peculiar watchfulness and care what am i but a poor unsheltered bark exposed to every gale  i am in all sincerity your affectionate sister susan paulet marleston  to mr paulet etc dear charles according to your desire i shall now endeavor to point out to you some minutiae as they are called which may serve as proper hints before you go into holy orders  minutiae which not being sufficiently attended to always confirm me in the opinion that a minister is either ignorant of or indifferent to the service he is to perform  by the rubric before the common prayer of the  d of edw vi it was ordered that the priest being in the quire that is in his own seat there should begin with the lords prayer but early in the reign of queen elizabeth reading desks were set up in the body of the church and then the sentences exhortation confession and absolution were generally introduced vide burns eccles law  in regard to the sentences i shall only observe that any of them are proper but if you begin with if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us but if we confess our sins he etc  you must here supply the word god for he has no reference the exhortation which must be read with dignity and earnestness should close i think at heavenly grace and the words saying after me should be pronounced as you are kneeling down  the absolution should not be given as i have frequently heard it as if the minister had power to forgive sins but the voice must be carefully kept up till you come to he pardons and forgiveth etc  the venite which must now be considered as another exhortation was formerly used to hasten people into church and durandus i think mentions that some lazy christians had always used to lie in bed till they heard the venite sung  the psalms in point of composition the    th psalm is a finer ode than any in horace  when israel came out of egypt and the house of jacob from among strange people  judah was his sanctuary and israel his dominion  the sea saw that and fled jordan was driven back  the mountains skipped like rams and the little hills like young sheep  what aileth thee o thou sea that thou fleddest and thou jordan that thou wast driven back  ye mountains that ye skipped like rams and ye little hills like young sheep  tremble thou earth at the presence of the lord at the presence of the god of jacob  the following verse who turned the hard rock into a standing water and the flintstone into a springing well in the translation is an instance of the bathos and i could there wish to have it omitted what a subject is this psalm for setting to music if boyce howard or some other great composer was to undertake it   have been objected to by many as being composed for particular occasions and not general enough in their use but they contain such energy such simplicity and elegance that the finest fervor of devotion must be borrowed from them  the stops you know are calculated for the chaunt and much absurdity will arise if you do not minutely consider the sense and keep up your voice at the end of those verses where the sentence is not complete  nor is this all  the manner must be particularly attended to  a penitential psalm should be read very differently from that of an exultation  in regard to the lessons there is a still greater scope  the manner of reading them should be as various as the matter for what can be more opposite than the commands of pharaoh and the supplication of judah  this is scarce ever attended to for most divines i am sorry to say read even the threatenings of goliath with the meek voice of david  the new testament demands that in the gospel you should plainly recite a narrative  in the fifteenth of corinthians that you should triumph in your redemption  in the belief i confess that i am much hurt that most congregations should bow at the name of jesus and not at that of god the father  this  if it has any meaning exalts the son above the father which is unnecessary in a protestant country  but the custom has crept in from taking a text in st paul in the literal sense at the name of jesus every knee shall bow etc  then follow the collects  and here i must particularly take notice of that on advent sunday which i hope you can repeat with the propriety it deserves  when you come to that passage that at the last day when he shall come again in his glorious majesty etc your own feelings will prompt you to throw in a suitable degree of solemnity  weigh the whole of it i entreat you for it is one of the finest models of petitionary composition  when the order for morning and evening service began with the lords prayer it ended with the third collect for grace  the litany was then a separate service and i could almost wish that it had either remained so or that more prayers were omitted on those days that it is appointed to be read  the recital of it however requires particular attention  oh how frequently has it offended both my ear and understanding when a minister has made a full stop at all uncharitableness as if he had no need to be delivered from it  in regard to the communion service i shall at present only observe that you should not give the commandments from the altar  this is making the old law of more weight than the new  the code to be amended more sacred than the law explained  in short if it must be read at all it should be read at the beginning not at the end but i need not inform you that this likewise was originally a separate service these are the chief remarks which immediately occur and which being weighed may add propriety to the fervency of your devotion  the subject will improve upon you by attention for though i am not so zealous as some divines who assert that our service is perfect in the beauty of holiness yet i am fully convinced that upon the whole it is a reasonable and a holy service controversy about the trinity in my opinion is a disease that wants quiet rather than cure  as to the articles the divines must give up a few to save the rest  they urge that such tests are necessary to keep out arians socinians evansonians etc  why should they be kept out in the name of god i say let them all come in and be made here as i hope they will be hereafter one fold under one shepherd   in regard to sermons let me ask you the following questions  have you studied dr jeremy tailor for matter and not for style have you read dr clarke for fine arguments and nice distinctions  sherlock for strength and persuasion ask the sinner then whether the fears of futurity are all idle dreams and as you like his answer follow his example sherlocks  th discourse  th vol    and jortin for plain reason and sober sense  have you felt the sublimity of warburton those specific attributes from which we deduce all our knowledge of the nature and will of god are formed on analogy and bear relation to ourselves but then we say such attributes are not on that account the less real or essential the light of the sun is not in the orb itself what we see it in the rainbow there it is one candid uniform perfect blaze of glory here we separate its perfection in the various attributes of red yellow blue purple and what else the subtle optician so nicely distinguishes but still the solar light is not less real in the rainbow where its rays become thus untwisted and each differing thread distinctly seen than while they remain united and incorporated with one another in the sun just so it is with the divine nature it is one simple individual perfection in the godhead himself but when refracted and divaricated in passing through the human mind it becomes power justice mercy which are all separately and adequately represented to the understanding warburtons  d sermon  st vol    and admired the concise elegance of hurd  you can answer i hope all these questions in the affirmative  let me then advise you to buy all the sermons that manwaring has ever published  would his pamphlets were folios but for more common use attend to  study bourdalone  the length of your discourses should not exceed twenty minutes few hearers can keep up their attention so long but should you be dull heavy uninstructive nay i will say unentertaining half that time will be estimated an hour  a good sermon delivered with propriety and earnestness always attracts  even the infidel keeps his snuff box in his pocket and the ladies are silent about their fans but once lose their attention the whole air distills the dews of morpheus the prentice recollects his saturdays fatigue and his mistress is forced to pinch her husband to prevent a snore  in short though i hate both i think volatile essence is a better ingredient in a sermon than a downright opiate  but what subjects must you choose for discourses  here i should hesitate  by no means introduce party  never preach at any body this is the fruit of private resentment not of christian zeal  dont pretend to expound very difficult texts  expositions of this kind become the press better than the pulpit  such disquisitions should be read not heard  address the senses and the heart  quote not chapter and verse but give the substance and if you could the manner of st paul for i am convinced that he preached not like  or  but like hinchliffe porteus or hurd  now and then take subjects from the bible but most frequently from the new testament a good comment on any sentence in our saviors sermon on the mount is of itself a full discourse but you may make excursions  i have read excellent discourses against gaming and very lately a most useful sermon against inhumanity to brutes but where are you to preach  by no means for a constancy in a village where your principal auditors will be only a few overgrown farmers it is well mr paulet has confined himself to the overgrown ones for i humbly conceive that the middling farmers like the middle ranks of people were the most attentive as well as the most intelligent of his audience editor  it is scarce possible to do much good amongst them  they will not regard you for your reasoning but for your revenue and i declare i would almost as willingly see you transported to live amongst the new zealanders as after the education i have given you that you should fall at last a dupe to gross ignorance and low conceit  the soldier is brave and the sailor is generous  the mechanic in the course of his traffic has had opportunities of enlarging his ideas but the farmer having never burst the web thinks himself as wise as the parish clerk who is convinced of his own omniscience because he has never met with any one but the parson to tell him the contrary  i allow that i speak here with some degree of acrimony but i am clearly convinced that these men have greatly augmented the distresses of the inferior clergy and it is chiefly owing to them in conjunction with attorneys that there is so much leading into captivity and such complaining in our streets  these are the only men about us my dear charles who have shown neither gratitude nor affection to the memory of poor mr arlington yet are ready on every occasion to bow the knee most servilely to the nabob  this brings on melancholy reflections adieu for the present and believe me ever  your affectionate father robert paulet marleston ps let me give you one more caution in regard to sermons  never introduce any thing ludicrous in them  it may be called preaching in the manner of south or stern but it is a bad manner and i pray you avoid it  atterbury has frequently disgusted me beyond measure with vulgar allusions and even the bishop of gloucester when he talks of hocus pocus tricks in a sermon on the resurrection     to the rev mr paulet dear father i cannot forbear sending you my earliest acknowledgements for your kind remarks  i will give them at least all the attention they deserve  i have not only seen your neighbor mr massem but have heard him speak in the house of commons on the booksellers petition  he enlarged on the nearness and dearness of property in general  that it was for that only that men had been enabled to risque every thing that was valuable to them in this life  that he thought authors were a very pernicious race of men that they caused all that abuse on men of property that appeared so frequently in the newspapers and that the booksellers were a pack of bloodhounds that set them on that he therefore hoped neither of them would have any relief under this here bill  that he thoroughly understood this particular kind of property he had weighed it and viewed it in every light and was fully convinced that the whole was merely a dispute between the statute law and the common law of the land for his own part therefore he should always be for the former  he spoke long and with great confidence and was much better heard on the subject of property than either a burke or a bar would have been had the weight and circulation of it been materially engaged against them  i write with a rapid pen which you must excuse etc  i am your dutiful and affectionate son charles paulet   to mr paulet dear charles i was in hopes to have found more remarks of mr arlingtons on gardening etc than i am at present able to send you  he evidently intended to have said more on architecture which is absolutely necessary likewise to be thoroughly understood by the complete master of modern design  from these papers you will see what notions the ancients held of gardening in general but should you ever wish to dive into further particulars i will show you a most curious book on that subject which i have by me the title of it is stengel de horto  mine is the second edition printed in    0  there are a thousand different receipts to make paradises and his account of the gardens in italy will much divert you indeed i suspect that the italian gardens are not much improved since the days of phflaumeren  in regard to the french gardens you may look over a book entitled voyage pittoresque des environs des paris par m d he begins as you would suppose a frenchman to begin with saying ce nest point un paradoxe davancer que les plus beaux jardins de leurope sont ceux de france  i was surprised to find in maundrells travels that there was so much genuine taste amongst the turks  since lord kamis and mr shenstone published their remarks there has appeared a little essay on design in gardening by a gentleman of the temple and an octavo volume of observations written by mr wh  ley both of them books of merit but the latter i think is too full of technical terms for a novice to engage in  mr arlington differs in opinion from mr mason in regard to avenues  this is combating great authority but if i was to decide i should be so oldfashioned as to give my verdict against the poet but you will say what is all this to me who perhaps may never have ten acres of ground in my possession or ever cultivate any thing better than potatoes or cabbages  this may be very true but i would be equally able to feel and to make proper remarks and to exclaim in the words of goldsmith that lawns lakes towns fields and woods  for me their tributary stores combine  creations heir the world the world is mine   i am your ever affectionate father robert paulet marleston march        strictures on landscape gardening from mr arlingtons papers  longinus gardening says an ingenious author lord kamis  was at first an useful art  but eden sir wm temple was calculated for pleasure and a life of labor succeeded not till after the fall  in modern language the garden of alcinous might be but a kitchengarden yet as eustathius observes ornaments was sought for even there however unsuccessfully unless we suppose the description given by homer to be wholly poetical and made at the pleasure of the painter like the little island of phaeacia  it would not be of much importance to enquire whether the gardens of babylon were brought into use by semiramis syrus or belus  we find in general that they were terraces one above the other carried up to the height of the wall of the city and planted with stately trees in imitation of the hanging woods which amyite had been accustomed to in the mountainous parts of media  as the gardens of solomon were chiefly calculated for magnificence and those of the hesperides celebrated for the excellence of their fruit only i shall venture to suppose the dawn of taste to rise with the old bard in his description of calypsos bower without the grot a various sylvan scene appeared around and groves of living green poplars and alders ever quivering played and nodding cypress formed a fragrant shade four limpid fountains from the clifts distill and every fountain pours a several rill in mazy windings wandering down the hill where bloomy meads with vivid greens were crowned and glowing violets threw odours round a scene where if a god should cast his sight a god might gaze and wonder with delight popes odyssey  it is not improbable says sir william temple but that the most refined pleasures of invention descended earlier into lower asia from damascus and assyria  but as these nations abounded not with heroes the poets make little or no mention of them  it has been supposed that epicurus was the first who introduced gardens into greece  but pliny assures us he was only the first who had a garden within the city of athens whereas before his time they were without the walls like the horti suburbani of the romans  in such retreats this great philosopher gave the most shining precepts of morality however misrepresented by the stoics or mistaken by those gross pretenders to his sect who conceived pleasure to consist only in sensuality  they served the two purposes of assembling the philosophers pupils for instruction and of furnishing them as cowley well expresses it with cheap and virtuous luxury  nor was this luxury confined merely to the philosophers  the greatest warriors sought for hours of reflection in such retirements and the same hands were employed in the service of agriculture which had raised and supported the glory of their country  though utility was chiefly sought for in the gardens of the philosophers yet virgils description of the elysian fields affords a most beautiful specimen of bold imagery and rich design  the full green of the woods  the gayly illuminated lawn the grove with the rapid river issuing from it the dusky thickets the fresh meads watered with rills the sequestered vale rendered more solemn by the thick wood and placid stream  his account likewise of the old corycians gardens makes us greatly lament that haste should have deprived the world of his masterly instructions on a subject he so much admired  father harduin indeed in his notes on pliny thinks the loss is amply made up to us by his brother jesuits poem on gardening which he puts in competition with the georgics  an opinion which will be adopted by such critics as feel no difference between the feeble descriptions of  and the glowing pictures of a mason  in england we have ever till of late most servilely copied our methods of gardening from the italians french flemish or dutch all of whom indeed seem to have offered nothing better in the construction of them than clipped hedges parterres squirting fountains truelove knots and flourishes  sir william temple seems much delighted with the taste brought in by king william of which the evergreen quarter at kensington remains a specimen and offers moore park in hertfordshire as the perfectest figure of a garden he ever saw  indeed he allows there may be other forms admitted wholly irregular but they must owe their beauty to some extraordinary dispositions of nature  lord bacon does not like images cut out in juniper or other gardenstuff  they be for children says he  but can approve of little low hedges cut round like welts with some pretty pyramids  and in some places fair columns upon frames of carpenters work  mr pope severely ridicules the invasion of nature but proposes a place to be copied from which in his time partook largely of the old absurdities a full detail of them may be found in monsr de phflaumeren etc  and whose beauties were but trifling and puerile  stowe when compared with versailles might demand some share of admiration but immense would be the distance from that genuine taste which shenstone vide letters on chivalry and romance and nature have brought us acquainted with  stowe indeed under its modern improvements may be considered as a very fine specimen of taste and design particularly by those who are unacquainted with the exquisite elegance  i had almost said the absolute perfection of lord scarsdales  it seems to me says lord kamis far from an exaggeration that good professors are not more essential to a college than a spacious garden which ought to be tempered with simplicity rejecting sumptuous and glaring ornaments  in this respect the university of oxford may be deemed a perfect model  that the gardens of oxford may be as useful and efficacious as those of ancient rome for the purposes of study and application i will by no means presume to deny  but they are certainly as artful as their buildings  they are formal without unity of design and complex without variety  regularity says the same author is required in that part of a garden which joins the dwelling house  the beauties of a dwelling house arise from regularity and proportion but the works of art and nature have a different destination  utility would suffer if the ground was not polished near the dwelling but this polish to speak philosophically should be i think inversely as the distance  mr burke doubts whether beauty be at all an idea belonging to proportion  surely the effect produced by it in architecture strikes even a common eye with pleasure  the instance produced from vegetables is not much to the purpose for it will appear from an accurate survey that there is more regularity in the parts of flowers than is commonly imagined  their forms indeed are infinitely varied but in the same plant nature seldom deviates from the laws of proportion and some of our best botanists have actually founded much of their systems upon the proportion of the parts  so far therefore from supposing no beauty to result from proportion we may infer that some part at least of the beauty even of vegetables arises from it  it is supposed by modern rules that all avenues of course must be cut down but i am far from thinking that they may not frequently remain to great advantage  they must be long and wide and should properly lead to a gothic castle tower or any other large and ancient building  i know it has been said vide essay on sublime and beautiful that avenues of a moderate length are far grander and that a true artist should always put a generous deceit on the spectator  but though perspective will lessen greatness in height as it gains in length burke  yet i think it is equally certain that the duke of montagus avenues will be considered as far more grand than those in st jamess park  to remedy the ill effects of a straight line an uniform curve is now adopted  but alteration is not always improvement  and it reminds me of the conduct of the matron who to prevent her daughter from dropping her chin into her bosom threw it up into the air by the aid of a steel collar  hogarths analysis has as yet been read to very little purpose  grandeur may possibly be enforced by surprise shenstone  but propriety will suffer for it  a magnificent building will certainly appear more magnificent after viewing a cottage  but where is the connection between a dairy and a chinese temple a rustic seat and a grecian altar  we rarely see the whole of a building with its furniture confined to one expression  some minute article is for ever giving us disgust  we view an hermitage for instance  from the gloomy entrance into it  the crucifix and other emblems placed in order  the strawbed and old seat  we are so struck with the solemnity of the scene that we are even in expectation of seeing the saint himself approach to meet us  till all of a sudden a modern dining table presents itself to view and at once destroys all our enthusiasm  how different this from the taste of him who thought of only putting a few rude planks together and carving the signs of the zodiac upon them                                      elevations of the different parts of blenheimhouse when viewed separately on paper are not unworthy of the greatest architect  but when taken together the whole appears as a most heavy pile of building  there is no contrast no relief though mr pope perhaps made too severe a remark when he called it a quarry of stones above ground  many of our modern houses have been built from italian models without the least reference or conformity to the change of country  on account of heat in italy it is necessary to have but few windows  this must ever make a building not only appear heavy but of course produce a contrary effect to that which ought to be sought for in a northern clime  it was not always a specimen of bad taste in our ancestors that they built their houses in a valley and moated them round about  safety in those times was principally to be considered  and improvements in mechanics had not then enabled them to live with equal convenience above hill as below  the common opinion at present is that a house cannot have too much prospect but i would carefully distinguish between looking at and overlooking objects  the summit may be very proper for an observatory but not always for a dwelling house from which all objects i think should be seen distinctly without the aid of a telescope           a garden on a flat lord kaims  it is said ought to be highly and the ornaments must be very carefully suited for to dress up trifling subjects in grand and exalted expressions will in the end only make them appear the more contemptible variously ornamented in order to occupy the mind and prevent its regretting the insipidity of a uniform plain  artificial mounts in this view are common  but no person has thought of an artificial walk elevated high above the plain  the effect of such a walk is most admirably exemplified in mr garricks but i cannot approve of the statue of shakespeare  surely it would have been time enough to have represented him in marble or stone when the very genius of shakespeare no longer presided there polished ground at hampton  there will always be a material difference where the master himself is possessed of a fine taste when compared with that of any hireling  he will more cooperate with nature  he has a better opportunity of becoming intimately acquainted with the genius of his own place  a difference not to be explained on paper perhaps but strongly to be felt at the mr shenstones leasowes  at mr hamiltons cobham  at sir r newdigates arbory  and lord scardales kedleston  no wonder that our taste in england is still to be condemned since most of ur largest gardens are laid out by some general undertaker who regardless of the peculiar beauties of each situation introduces the same objects at the same distances in all  art should ever be timid of overstepping the modesty of nature for any thing overdone is from the purpose and though it may make the unskilful admire cannot but make the judicious grieve  the censure of which one as shakespeare observes to the actors must in your allowance youtweigh a whole theater of others  gardening then in its highest stage of improvement is of the nature of an epic poem  the plan must be great entire and one dryden even the least portions must have a reference to the whole  nothing of a foreign nature like the trifling conceits which bad poets or bad gardeners are always ready to introduce by which the observer is misled into another sort of pleasure opposite to that which is designed in the general plan one conduces to the designers aim the completing of his work  the other slackens his pace diverts him from his way and locks him up like a knight errant in an enchanted castle when he should be pursuing his main adventure  in short as pope says to build to plant whatever you intend to rear the column or the arch to bend to swell the terras or to sink the grot in all let nature never be forgot still follow sense of every art the soul parts answring parts shall slide into a whole      to the rev mr paulet dear father i have of late forborne to give you any account of my pupil as i could not give you a very favorable one  he is permitted by his uncle to sit up so late overnight that he is generally unfit for business all the next day  a circumstance has lately happened that has given me much uneasiness though i believe i had more reason to be concerned for his principles than his safety  a dispute arose the other evening at cards i suspect and words ran so high that it was at length agreed to decide the important matter by single combat  the heroes met in form at the appointed time  their pistols missed fire and the seconds interposed  and there it ended  this however with the initials of their names  in couched terms  with distant observations  and short inuendoes makes out a very pompous paragraph for the newspapers  i have often in my own mind attributed the great increase of duelling to the accounts that are there inserted  of this i am certain it is one cause at least if not a principal one but duelling will always be practiced in every country where the dread of shame is greater than the love of glory  for instance now we read that a great dispute happened the other day at a certain great assembly the robinhood perhaps or the sixpenny pantheon which was determined to be decided by single combat  on the day appointed mr a  met captain b  mr d  was second to mr a  and captain g  was second to captain b  mr a  received the first fire and asked captain b  if he would then ask pardon who roughly answered  no his honor forbad him  then said mr a  i must fire though it will give me the most inexpressible concern to rob the public of so gallant and so respectable a character  on which he presented his pistol pulled the trigger and the ball grazed captain b  s shoulderknot who instantly fell to the ground  the seconds interposed and mr a  called to a surgeon who stood at a small distance to assist captain b  who was immediately carried home in a chair  then comes we hear that the amiable miss c  was so alarmed at captain b  s danger she did not know we presume at what distance they were to fire that she lay in fits the whole day and her life is even now despaired of  captain b  s misery on this occasion is easier to be conceived than expressed but he was conscious that a man destitute of honor must be totally unworthy of miss c  s love  let your barber only read all this and he sleeps not till he makes himself conspicuous  accept my best thanks for the gardening papers which i have just received  will write again soon  in the mean time believe me etc  charles paulet cavendishsquare  to the rev mr paulet dear father my situation is every day more and more disagreeable to me  my pupil has formed connections that will ruin his peace and destroy my satisfaction  his fortune is come too soon and there are vulturs that already make a prey of him  his uncle says he disapproves of gaming but is for ever speaking respectfully of the most abandoned characters of the times and the young man is taught in the world that to discharge any debts but those of honor is mechanical  to regard money is below a man of rank when so many men without any can cut so great a figure  it is not i find till men have played deep that they know the resources  then they can borrow money and get great names to be bound with them if one does not pay another must  but if none can  they must bilk their creditors by going abroad unless some lady of great fortune will in the mean time make herself happy by marrying a man of fashion and of the world  this year then the whole set are again established they contract new debts and find out new fools to become security for the payment of them  whilst our nobility and gentry are thus squandering away their estates what wonder is it that negociators and attorneys are purchasing all the principal seats about london  their incomes are made great by annuities and their principal is established by premiums  these usurers if they have not the impudence to take seats in parliament themselves can nevertheless carry on the sale of boroughs for their dependents and young men thus seduced are generally compelled to barter their dearest interests to gain petty places in the excise perhaps at the foot of the treasuryboard that they may satisfy the rapacious demands of an usurers clerk  interest in the house arises from connections at arthurs and popularity is gained in the world from the clerks brother being a writer in the news  every day new fools admire and new fools are every day admitted to be plundered  my pupil alas is already a melancholy instance of a slavish subjection to the tyranny of fashion and will soon be irrevocably plunged into the deep and desperate gulf of gaming  last night however he gave me at least a serious hearing but informed me that it was utterly impossible that i should know any thing of life or of the world  gaming says he is as necessary a qualification for a young man of fashion as dress dancing fencing or a knowledge of modern languages  it is practiced universally abroad and play here at a high stake is not only an introduction but become the only key of admittance into most of the best companies  how would sir john rouleau have ever got a seat in parliament if he had not made a good acquaintance at arthurs or newmarket  these are the only schools of advancement and those fortunes says he which you call lost are only transferred for a night or two into other hands  besides if they never return the great can easily make other compensations and where is the difference between receiving a large income from a place or from dirty farms except that the former is here considered as the more honorable  those who value the latter only can never be received into company at all except at countymeetings or raceballs and then they are only admitted like parsons to laugh at bad jokes or dance with ugly partners  all this may be very true but i am yet to be convinced that it is necessary to become a man of fashion if the title must be purchased at the expense of peace virtue honor and religion however no reply can be made to arguments which have no weak side of reason to be attacked upon but of this i am certain that such principles every day increase in the kingdom and in a short time i fear will overwhelm it  from this cursed fount what mighty evils flow gaming  thou source of every human woe thou bane to peace thou cause of every care wives children parents  all the ruin share it is thine to rob the mind of all relief and sink the hero to the midnight thief you will most probably receive my next from bath  on my return from thence i intend to leave my pupil and go into orders  i am ever etc charles paulet cavendishsquare  to mr charles paulet etc dear charles i shoot this letter at random  if you have left town for bath it will only for a while delay some uneasiness  glanville i had been informed had taken such liberties with your sister that i was determined to intercept a letter which i supposed to have come from him  it proved to be the enclosed which i send for your perusal in the mean time i have made no other comment but to forbid my daughter from ever having any more connections with that family  you will see the use that is made of lord chesterfields letters which i have read  his mind poor man was a fine flowergarden overrun with weeds  but he is dead  mr stanhope is likewise dead  they are both dead  to meditate on death is to pass the severest censure on those epistles  had he reflected on death as frequently as on the graces he would not i think have taught his son that to dissemble was to prepare for it  but read the enclosed  i am dear charles ever etc etc robert paulet marleston  from miss massem to miss paulet marlestonhall sunday morn my dear susy after you left us last night you cannot think how captain glanville laughed at your notions of everlasting constancy and that if once you had given your affections you was sure they could never be alienated  do you know that he swears no womans affections ever yet served a regular apprenticeship and that you have arts and graces enough to make any man wind about and serpentine just as you please  apropos  you must read lord chesterfields letters which i will send you  his advice to his son in regard to the world will hold exactly right as to any womans management of a husband  he says very justly that because man is a rational animal you must not suppose therefore that he always acts rationally you must watch his weak unguarded moments get into his secrets engage his heart and you will easily dupe his understanding  dissimulation is the virtue of the great and as you will see from these excellent books the men not only practice it but profess it as a science how then shall we be able to cope with them if we do not fight with as good weapons and play off their own arts against themselves  now for instance suppose you was to marry an old bachelor  i think you might overthrow all his little systems in a fortnight  to be sure at times he would be restive and cross but then you must suppose he never speaks his real sentiments and at others he will quietly enough return to his shackles  this is what mr pope means by  if she rules him never shows she rules   why should she show it for her time to take advantage is only when alone before company she must always acquiesce or the world will not be of her side and as lord chesterfield says the world is always the dupe of deceit and it is therefore much better to seem than to be  i knew a lady that adopted this mode of conduct exactly and was very successful  to be sure the man was very miserable and at last i believe died of a broken heart but the world to this day are almost unanimously agreed that she undoubtedly made him one of the very best of wives  for the future leave all your letters at mary cuttles and i shall be sure to receive them safe  i am ever my dear susys sincerest friend and servant catharine massem but my dearest susy i must of all things caution you against marrying a wit  it is a noxious seeing animal against whom you may play off a whole battery of tears oaths sighs and protestations to no effect  as to money you must be an oeconomist in his pleasures if you mean to be extravagant in your own     to the rev mr paulet dear father i have now been near a week at bath with my pupil  we lodge at the new hotel called york house which is very commodious  indeed more so i think than the noble one just fitted  in covent garden as there are more conveniences under the same roof  you have heard so much of the neatness and regularity of the buildings here that it is unnecessary for me to expatiate upon them  the circus and south front of the square are beautiful beyond description but i cannot approve the crescent though i must confess i never saw any building where so many rules of architecture were violated that altogether looked so well  to describe the manners and fashions here would be far beyond my art though they have many peculiar to themselves  as in town people quarrel for places and preferments and where some great prize is held up to the aspirants so here for want of better employment they have been absolutely compelled to quarrel for nothing at all  not whether one man should have more popularity or higher distinction than another but whether he should go up the hill or down to dance his minuet and whether the important place of master of the ceremonies should be filled by a native of ireland or england  nay to so great a degree has this fashion of quarrelling for nothing prevailed amongst the fair sex that not content merely with the war of the tongue they have even descended to blows  this can be attributed to nothing but the extraordinary fermentation of the waters  the numberless evils to which mankind are always by necessity exposed should make them one would think at all times endeavor to unite in bands of mutual harmony and here especially where so many are in a perpetual state of suffering  yet here from mere fashion the strangest infatuation prevails even amongst invalids who fly as far as possible from the baths and the shelter of the lower town to brave the turbulency of the mountains  the buildings are now extended so far that as the irishman would say bath is run away from itself it is absolutely gone out of its own town and it may do very well for the healthful to follow it but sure it is the greatest absurdity in the world that invalids should fly as far as possible from shelter and from all those advantages for which bath is so peculiarly and so justly celebrated  the waters if you believe the apothecaries are specifics for all disorders there is only one that you can possibly die of which is obstinacy  this becomes incurable from not taking advice enough about the use of them when present or by removing from the benefit of them too soon  it is true lady skinandbone has been coughing up her lungs here these two years but would certainly have recovered had she not obstinately refused to stay one fortnight longer and my lord lastlegs would absolutely have relinquished his crutches in a few days more and hung them up in the pumproom as the most memorable trophies in it  had he not obstinately resolved to change these ever efficacious waters for those of bristol  in regard to the diversions there is a playhouse here where the actors exclusive of garrick are in general full as good as those in town  in tragedy they do not always speak with a good accent and good discretion but i have seen some characters in comedy really supported with great humor and propriety  the new rooms are elegantly fitted up and may be better calculated perhaps than any others for the purposes of dancing and gaming but as i never partake of the latter and not very frequently of the former they afford me but little or no entertainment  for an evening or two i might have been delighted with the splendour of the appearance but soon as some one expresses it  the gay idea palls upon the sense  and coldly strikes the mind with feeble bliss in short if i was obliged to give you my opinion of bath i should define it to be a place in which though life perhaps may not be passed most usefully it may nevertheless be wasted agreeably  amongst wanton widows and debauched wives forsaken irishmen and forsaking men of quality  this place is so fertile of anecdote that i could send you volumes from it instead of epistles  i am ever etc etc charles paulet ps there is a literary society established near bath by a set of gentlemen and ladies where many improvements are made on the prizes that were distributed by the ancients  instead of the bay they give jessamine and instead of laurels artificial nosegays  i have not seen any of the literary productions but hear there will soon be published a most excellent didactic poem on the beautiful arch of lady horatia pedants auburn eye brow     the following letters from the rev mr paulet to his son at bath conclude the volume  to mr paulet woburn sat night dear charles this morning put a period to all my happiness  your sister  your lost unhappy sister is fled with glanville  the care the affection that i have ever shown for her  all the principles of virtue and religion that i have ever endeavored to inculcate have availed her nothing and she is fled at last with glanville  from her infancy i have labored to prove myself a kind and indulgent father and now when i meant to reap the harvest of my toil  behold this is my reward  but i myself have been the cause  i have given up too far  but as she had lost her mother and my notions of life were supposed to be too contracted the opinions of others have weighed against me and i have relaxed my own principles to her ruin  i have got so far on my road to town but can hear no tidings which way they took  nor is it needful for me to inquire  i am rather flying from myself than in pursuit of her  she is for ever lost  she is ruined  she fled alas with glanville  had his intentions been honorable whence this secrecy  but nothing can exculpate her  she knew the depth of misery into which i should be plunged and had she thought of marriage would have saved my desperation  glanville would not marry her  he owns no ties of either honesty or honor  he could violate all engagements if he made any and the infatuated world would call it gallantry  all her principles were polluted  she was deaf to shame as well as virtue who could dare to triumph thus over the weakness of a fathers heart  delay not my son to seek  to inquire  to upbraid  it is too late alas to recall  and should chance or fortune cast her in your way  reproach her with her infamy  tell her that she has violated her duty to herself  to me  and if there needs an aggravation of her crime  to her god  that no penance can obliterate the stain  that she has pulled down ruin on herself and on her father and that his tears will be drops of vengeance on her head for ever  tell her  no no this may be too harsh  tell her only that if she would return  i could forgive her   london dear charles i have now no hopes of seeing you before i leave town for i have at last got some faint intelligence of your sister and shall set off immediately for dover  should she have set sail for i hear he is carrying her to france i shall then relinquish all pursuit and leave her to the protection of that power that can amend her heart and assuage my sorrows  when you perceive me thus torn and distracted with my grief harbor not a thought that your sister was ever dearer to me than yourself  she is lost  and now awakens all my anxiety but thou art ever with me and all that i have is thine   dear charles let those only talk of bearing up against afflictions who have never felt them  there may be such situations that no principles can fortify the mind against and under which the greatest and the best must ever fall  into such a one is your unhappy father plunged  i pursued my journey so much faster than i expected for man neither knows his weakness nor his strength that i thought by night i should even reach dover but gaining no tidings i began to sink under my fatigue and to hope only from time for that aid which philosophy could not afford me  as i was passing through a small village i saw all the people running out with unfeeling curiosity after a poor wretch who they told me was falling into labor  the officers i found were persecuting her to save expenses to the next parish and had refused her not only harbor but relief  no situation can dispense with our humanity  i determined therefore to allot some few shillings to succor at least if not to save this victim of distress  as i came nearer the rabble stopped and for a while i even forgot my own miseries to contemplate hers  i inveighed against their cruelty in the bitterest terms  broke through the crowd and insisted on their affording her some relief  they told me there was no occasion for the woman entreated only for to die  i demanded that they should convey her to the next alehouse  that i would leave my watch  my money  my aid to carry her into it alas i was unable to give for she was now from agonies become an object too shocking for humanity to behold  i was at length responsible for her charges and the crowd were indifferent to her distress  as soon as they had borne her in i entreated her to take comfort  bewailed her miseries  assured her that if either by leaving my watch or some money i could procure her cordial medicine or assistance i would relieve her  she looked up wistfully in my face and told me she wished me only to forgive  think my dearest charles what must be my feelings when i found this object of misery to be no other than my poor unhappy daughter whom that villain glanville had thus basely deserted  for a while i fear i was unable to yield that assistance as a father that she would have found from me as a friend  but recovering my tranquillity  i assured her that all resentments were lost in her distress that i had even forgot she had offended me and that if she could recover  alas says she it is now too late for i have languished whole days from want  without friend  without money  and without that comfort that innocence could have afforded me but that to see me once again was more than her fondest wishes ever formed nor had she another hope than by the blessing of a father to look up for the forgiveness of her god  but here i pause for the scene became too affecting and i believe i was carried away from her before death put a period to her distress  fondly bewailing her untimely fate i sit by her faded corse and shed the tender tribute of unavailing tears  thinking that i still see her only as asleep  that i shall again enjoy the sweets of her converse and that we shall again be happy  happy indeed we may be in another world but never more in this  but i blush to refer myself only to futurity when on earth i can feel no more comfort  oh charles think not that i mean to vindicate wrong or that my fondness gets the better of my principles  i know her errors but will not with a malicious world think this the only fault that a woman can never expiate  it is not believe me an horror at the crime but the pride of life that begets these distinctions let the cold the selfish and the unfriendly speak rigidly of her offenses a father could feel only for her distress  when this first burst of my grief begins to subside i shall endeavor to take some measures for her removal for at all adventures i resolve to bury her at marleston not with those honors perhaps as if adorned with virtue yet nevertheless with a decency that is due to the unfortunate and lest ill tongues should hereafter be too busy with her fame i will inscribe something like the following epitaph upon her tomb  stop  gentle maid  whoever thou art   the end
