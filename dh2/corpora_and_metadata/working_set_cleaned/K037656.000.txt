row mdcclxxxvi  price one shilling and six pence  dedication to mrs montague madam though i can boast no acquaintance with mrs montague but that intellectual one which the world of taste in general claims with her i trust she will pardon the liberty of prefixing her name to a comedy the writer of which feels an admiration equal to her own for shakespeare when research and criticism seemed exhausted in throwing lights on the works of this great fountain of english dramatic genius you madam as if a spirit more congenial to his own approach still nearer to the immortal poet dispel the last mist which time had shed around him and unveil the full glory of his mind the small tribute of respect i have presumed to pay your talents in the course of my comedy madam was believe me the

circumstance which on the first blush of the business must appear rather singular he would be a soldier was presented to mr colman in the course of last summer and returned  because that gentleman did not like a line of it and left this comfortable intelligence were not sufficient to wound the feelings of the writer mr colman added he did not know what could be done with it or in what shape it could be produced so as to contribute to the entertainment of the public  the author declares that he then entertained such notions of mr colmans judgment taste and high sense of honor that his opinion was final with him he laid by his performance in despair of ever acquiring profit or same by it  fortunately an intimate friend one day advised him to show the piece to mr harris imagining even mr colman might be mistaken or influenced by motives the writer of this address neversuspected any man harbored till bitter experience convinced him of the contrary mr harris to the very great surprise and no doubt very great pleasure of the author happened to be totally of a different way of thinking from mr colman and what is more he heard the latter gentlemans opinion of the comedy but had too strong and too good a mind to be biassed by it the success which has attended the piece makes all farther comment on this short history of it unnecessary and with the liveliest sense of gratitude for the marked attention kindness and liberality of mr harris the author submits his production to the perusal of the world  prologue written by the author of the comedy and spoken by mr

going abroad was privately married to a beautiful girl who waited on his mother he had a son by this girl and as the child came into the world just as he was obliged to embark with the army for portugal the war before last he left him in my care desiring me to let him pass for my own till his return and in case he was killed to continue the deception till the death of his father   mrs will and has the colonel never been in england since   will never till within these few days therefore his son continued with me till he was twelve years old when i lost him   mrs will in what manner did you lose him   will i cannot be certain but as he was a boy of great spirit and ever prattling of being a soldier i suspect he was inveigled off by a recruiting party which at that time was beating up for men in the village   mrs will didnt you acquaint his mother immediately with what had happened   will she was dead   mrs will you wrote to the colonel to be sure   will there i was to blame i could not summon up resolution sufficient i thought he would have attributed the childs leaving me to neglect or cruel treatment   mrs will the best advice i can give you is to tell colonel talbot his son is dead   will but how shall i produce a certificate of that should he examine the parish register and no record of such a childs death be found i should be taken up and tried on a suspicion of murder   mrs will then tell him the truth at once   will worse and worse  he will suppose this a mere invention of my own to screen my villainy else why was i silent so long and that i had been bribed

writing to him so long   mrs will you must say you never received one of his letters and your quitting the country will make it probable enough they might have miscarried   will then to give his son no better education   mrs will you must say he would not take any better and you may find instances enough of as dull heirs to large estates to give color to your story   will and make a drawer of him too   mrs will well he will not be the first great man that has cried coming up sir  what do you stand confounded for away away man and let me break the matter to caleb   will it goes against my

father    exeunt mrs wilkins ridiculing him scene a drawing room at the house of sir oliver oldstock enter charlotte and harriet char how you teize me about this allaccomplished sir charles  i cannot abide him   har cannot abide him  i dont think it possible for any woman actually to dislike him   char yet he is the last person breathing i should elect for my caro sposo the mans well enough as an acquaintance he is lively does not want for understanding but the best of him is the talent he possesses for discovering the ridiculous wherever it is to be found  then he paints it in colors so high and so pleasantly ill natured that a woman takes him in her suite as the natural appendage of superior understanding to show that her wit has raised her above the power of ridicule and that she has the chief laughers in town upon her own side   har what you praise him for is in my mind the only exceptionable part of his character   char lord what harm is there in a little goodhumored ill nature  besides what would you have people talk of when they meet as politics are to the men scandal is to our sex  these two subjects are the vast magazines of the major part of our ideas between them the heads of half the nation are furnished   har have you seen mandeville today   char poor harriet now do i perceive the cause of all this extraordinary zeal for the interests of the handsome baronet you still are apprehensive if you dont provide me with a husband i shall take your beloved mandeville from you   har as he is sole heir to colonel talbots immense fortune i know your father will proceed to the last extremities   char dear harriet rest perfectly satisfied in my friendship for you i never will have him i dont know what i would not do to avoid it my heart is at present a virgin tablet on which love has not written a single character however should things come to the worst you yourself must be my deliverer   har as how   char even by taking wing with your beloved swain for that blessed spot where law forges no setters for the heart and hymen with a smile upon his cheek and his torch burning clear lights consenting votaries to the temple of real and lasting felicity  heaven and a generous uncle be praised who bequeathed me ten thousand pounds independent of my father i am not obliged to sacrfice my own and my friends happiness  o glorious independence  thou parent of every virtue  no wonder so many noble hearts emptied their crimson fountains to preserve thee   har i am ashamed charlotte to have harbored a suspicion but for a moment that a mind like yours could act unworthy of itself   char now to put my theory into practice  here comes mandeville do you step into the next room where you may overhear our conversation and you shall be entertained with a prologue truly antimatrimonial   har dear charlotte i am already perfectly satisfied   char but i insist on your going it will enterain you    exit har enter mandeville char my dear mandeville i was just wishing for you if you had staid much longer i should have been insupportably vapourd nothing runs in my head but our marriage but i was thinking as the fondest couples have certain dull hours that hang heavy upon their hands how we two shall kill time during those spiritless seasons   man i suppose we shall follow the example of other people do all we can to make one another uneasy   char that is one way to be sure of killing time but we shall grow tired of that at last dont you think so mandeville   man when i entertain a good opinion of a ladys wit it rids me of all apprehension on that score   char sir your most obedient   man i thought your cousin harriet was here   char my cousin harriet  lord what is my cousin harriet to the purpose  i shall grow jealous of you at this rate  i wonder mandeville what star shed its influence when our marriage was first talked of no two people breathing agreed better   man i always thought you the pleasantest companion imaginable   char we were continually laughing at one bodys expense or another   man and as soon as we are married i fancy every body will be even with us   char heigho   man what is that for madam   char not for a husband i assure you it was only a requiem to friendship going to be laid in the grave of matrimony methinks we two are preparing ourselves for the penance of our future union as knightserrant of old prepared themselves for the toils of chivalry i have read somewhere that those champions of distressed damsels at first wore heavy weights to their armor which they fancied on removal would give a comparative lightness to the galling load with which they were about to tax their shoulders   enter harriet har just now mr mandeville as i parted from my cousin a servant came and told me that your uncle colonel talbot was arrived  your father charlotte has received a letter from him  but what do you think it seems he has a son nobody ever heard of before   char a son  now mandeville if you can be content with your mistress and a moderate income i am satisfied you may have her as the bulk of colonel talbots fortune will certainly devolve to his son depend upon it my father will no more press my ladyship on your worship   man madam my uncle may dispose of his property as he pleases  i sincerely rejoice at his safe arrival in england and as he has an heir i shall be the first to congratulate him on the event and i hope that heir may prove an heir to his virtues   char you are a generous fellow mandeville and if it did not cost you so dear i should congratulate you on the certain prospect you may indulge that we two shall never be one   man my dear harriet    char now why dont you say my dear mandeville one as naturally follows the other as the echo does the found   man the occasion ladies i trust will apolo gize for my leaving you thus abruptly   char oh go go you have my ample consent  but harriet will you let him go off easily   har how can you be so ill natured   char she says she gives you leave to go but it is on condition that you do not dedicate a second of your time to any human being but her self longer than common decency requires it  but mandeville do you and i part as we ought a betrothed pair   man yes charlotte for we part wedded friends again   exit manent harriet and charlotte  char now harriet are all your apprehensions removed   har they are my friend hope sits smiling at my heart and once more chears it with a prospect of happiness   exeunt end of the first act act ii scene an apartment at sir oliver oldstocks enter sir oliver alone this is a devilish lucky hit the colonels having a son it enables me to provide for both my niece and daughter  i expect from the latter a good deal of contradiction in this business but i like that i shoudnt love her half so much as i do if she had not spirit enough to contradict me  it shows she has an opinion of her own and gives me an opportunity to prove that i have one also but of a much superior kind and upon occasions of a very coercive quality it is one time in a hundred i can get any body to contradict me but men of large independent fortunes never hear the truth  nobody has spirit enough to oppose them in discourse  henceforward i am determined to take no man by the hand who does not speak and look when we come to debate as if he would knock me down in an argument well i think i shall be as happy as a married man can be when my girls are disposed of my wife to be sure has a most unaccountable humor to suppose i am jealous of her now she is in her fiftyfifth year  to do lady lucretia oldstock justice she was once a charming woman but at present i think her as plain a piece of goods as a man could meet between temple bar and whitechapel  here she comes brimfull of news  enter lady oldstock la old was ever any thing so wonderful   sir o nothing upon earth what is the matter my love   la old why havent you heard that colonel talbot has a son   sir o a son  a dozen i dare be sworn if he would but own them an old soldier has generally children in all the quarters of the globe   la old sir oliver youre a censorious man and judge of every body by yourself   sir o upon my soul my dear you allow me too much credit i never was a man of all that gallantry no no i had a domestic magnet that attracted and fixed all my affections united to such a woman as lady oldstock who could be a rover   la old why to do you justice sir oliver you have upon the whole made a very good husband and if it was not for the weakness of your temper in one particular we might live very happily   sir o aside now she is off   la old if indeed i was one of the giddy flirts of the day it would be another thing  but a woman of whose truth you have had so many years experience to be jealous   sir o i tell you again and again i am not jealous   la old ah sir oliver i wish you would make your words good if any man of the least tolerable appearance pays me a common mark of respect dont you immediately sneer and say that fellow has a design upon you   sir o so i do i always think that person has a design upon another to whom he gives their own way in every thing no no if i am to choose a friend and an agreeable companion give me the honest fellow who contradicts me   la old then you are not jealous   sir o no   la old no   sir o no damme if ever i was jealous of you   la old you are now more provoking if possible than ever when you find i hold your ridiculous suspicions in contempt you would wound me another way and mortify my pride by insinuating that i never had attractions sufficient to have a civil thing said to me like other women   sir o then it seems my lady you have had your civil things said to you like other women in your time   la old there there it broke forth what it is to be married to a jealous husband   sir o well all this i can bear because i like contradiction  i consider the mind like a spring the more you press it the more vigor you lend to its elasticity since i can remember i always delighted to be of a different opinion from other people there is something wonderfully flattering to human pride in being singular  but in marriage it is absolutely neccessary  man and wife are like the contending qualities of bitter and sweet they naturally quarrel and exist by downright opposition   enter charlotte la old i will submit my cause to the judgment of charlotte   char submit your cause to my judgment my dear maam by no means in all cases of matrimonial litigation the parties should be tried by their peers   sir o right my girl now in order to qualify you to be impanelled on suits of the kind i was that moment thinking about moving the court of hymen to show cause why a rule should not be granted to provide you with a husband   la old whenever you marry charlotte if you wish to be happy above all things avoid a temper like your fathers   sir o and like your mothers also if you wish your husband to be happy   la old i clearly perceive my company is not agreeable   sir o your strange turn of mind i confess lady oldstock is not altogether so agreeable but you see it does not make me angry   la old it is that that tortures me  if i could vex him it would be a proof i had some power left but he treats me like a child   exit lady oldstock sir o it is a spoilt one if i do   char dear sir let me follow her   sir o you shall not budge a step after her  soothing her in these humors is only adding fuel to fire your mother charlotte was born a coquette and will die one she was a reigning toast in her youth and to this hour expects the adulation of those days she had a whole army of lovers and what you will say ought to make me set a very high value upon her indeed either from necessity or choice she hung like an overblown rose on the virgin thorn full four and thirty years waiting for me but come sit down and let me talk to you they sit i have for some time back observed charlotte that the match i proposed to you with mandeville does not meet your wishes   char i confess sir it never did  besides i know that gentlemans affections to be engaged elsewhere   sir o i understand you he is fond of my niece harriet well in the name of happiness let them go together i will never mention his name to you again nor indeed shall i propose any match to you upon which i may expect rational contradiction   char now sir you speak like my father  oh how my heart springs with gratitude and joy to hear those generous words from your own lips   sir o no my girl you shall never be sacrificed at the altar of plutus  i say sacrificed  for what is it in fact but a sacrifice to throw away a fine young woman upon a man it is impossible she should like as many fathers do every day who love money more than their children   char the liberality of these sentiments delight me they are so exactly in conformity with my own dear sir you have given me such spirits  do you know when you asked me to sit down i expected to have a quite different kind of conversation with you   sir o i suppose you thought i had some golden calf to propose to you for a husband   char i own i was so ungenerous   sir o a fellow with nothing but gold in his pocket and lead in his pate ha ha ha   char ha ha ha   sir o how liable we are to be mistaken in our surmises of other peoples thoughts no no my girl i have no such match to propose to you  i have a husband for you it is true in my eye and a rich one too  but it is not to riches you object  it is to the man and provided he be agreeable i imagine no woman in her senses can suppose a husband may be too rich   char provided riches be obtained without leaving a stain upon the principles it is happiness to possess them as they give us so much more ample power of distributing felicity i never was that romantic fool to imagine there can be happiness where there is not independency grant me that and all the wealth beside which the earth contains or the seadevours should not bribe me to sell the free election of my heart or barter for gold what gold could never restore me   sir o give me a kiss you jade you are your fathers own daughter but every body tells me youre the picture of me and if the colonels son be but as like his father as you are yours you will be the handsomest couple in great britain   char rising the colonels son sir   sir o yes my old friend colonel talbots son one of the finest young fellows i am told  but no sop  he has none of the vices and follies of your young butterflies of fashion   char no sir nor any of their accomplishments or i am misinformed   sir o it was an excellent thought of his fathers to have him brought up in a snug private way   char and yet i am told he has lived some time in a snug public way   sir o what charlotte have you been listening to any scandalous reports of the youth   char a pretty youth i understand he is for the husband of your daughter  i am told he was actually a waiter at some horrid place near smithfield   sir o oh infamous scandal  he a waiter at some horrid place near smithfield  the next report i suppose will be that you were bar maid at the same places and that i am an old tobacconist who supplied the house with cut and dry from the sign of the black boy in a neighboring alley   char i am petrified as the very thoughts of the brute   sir o look you there now she knows i love contradiction in my heart and therefore seems averse to the match because she thinks it will please me but come you and your mother and my niece shall go pay the colonel and his son a morning visit   char sir as you insist upon it i will go as i would to see any other great natural curiosity   sir o was ever any thing like this she has heard a scandalous report of a man and she will not wait to be undeceived by her own eyes and her own ears this is downright inconvincible obstinacy not rational wellfounded contradiction and i hate the one as much as i love the other besides i ever thought you a girl of too much sense to lay any kind of stress on a tale of mere rumor   char but if rumor should speak truth   sir o he is so great a liar i would not believe him   exeunt scene an apartment at mandevilles enter johnson and colonel talbot johns he is a rough diamond sir he requires a little polishing i must confess   col good masters may remove his ignorance and good company polish his manners but there is a meanness in the turn of his person and the cast of his features which is insuperable but take man in every point of view and he will be found the creature of habit his body like his mind is subdued by education   johns i wonder sir you never wrote to any particular friend in england to have inquired about him when you received no letter from this man to whose care you committed him   col who could i trust none of my own family  then what solid friendships do you suppose are contracted at the age i left england i was then but twenty all my intimates were young fellows sunk in pleasure and dissipation if any thing like friendship had subsisted between us the many years we were asunder had dissolved the tie his mother i knew was dead and from wilkinss silence i concluded that he also had paid the debt of nature therefore i defisted from writing thinking it was in vain to hope for any certainty till i had myself reached england   johns i should not have believed it possible your honor could have had such a son let his education be what it may   col i own johnson the weakness of a father induced me to believe i should have found him very different i fancied i should have seen him emerging from the low contracted sphere to which his fate had consigned him by the native energy of his own powers and flattered myself with the pleasing dream of surprising a young man with affluence and distinction who in obscurity had acquired virtue to deserve them   johns i beg your honors pardon  but as i cannot see the least likeness of you in this young gentlemans face i suppose he resembled his mother   col his mother  she had the countenance of an angel   johns then he differs from you both most devilishly  but sir the sooner you provide him with a fencing and a dancing master the better the latter of these gentlemen seems indispensably necessary if it is only to teach him to walk for no raw recruit on the first day of drilling was ever more pigeontoed   col where is he now   johns i left him sir very busy over his luncheon   col his luncheon   johns yes sir a small morsel he takes before dinner just to stay his stomach consisting of about a pound of beaf steaks and a tankard of porter   col send him to me  exit johnson  i fear he is incorrigibly gone beyond the power of reformation   enter mandeville col dear mandeville what course do you advise me to pursue with this untoward boy with all his faults i must consider he is my son and pity whilst he compels me to blush for him   man sir we must endeavor to form him as well as we can but i am rather inclined to think we shall never be able to give him the graces   col he is not three and twenty  that is young we have many begin later in life to acquire the rudiments of those sciences in which they afterward arrived to the highest pitch of eminence  have you been able to discover how the natural bent of his temper inclines or if he has any strong propensities   man why sir from what i can collect in my short acquaintance with him the natural bent of his temper seems inclined to gallantry and if he has any strong propensity it is to the game of skittles   col no matter how low and vulgar the game be it shows a spirit of play in him and it must be crushed but if he has a turn for gallantry it gives me the greatest hopes of his reformation the society of an accomplished and beautiful woman softens and refines the roughest nature she imparts by a secret magic her elegances and her graces and to converse with her is a kind of study that insensibly polishes her admirer  but what reason have you to suppose he is inclined to gallantry   man he has imparted all his amors to me but one in particular which very much diverted me indeed  after having been successful with bar maids young milleners and taylors daughters out of number cupid shot him from a cheesecake battery and he fell in love with a pastrycooks daughter which oh terrible was the cause of his having an affair of honor with an attorneys clerk in which both parties were bound over but in painting this helen who bred the contention how shall i do him justice at second hand teniers lent him his pencil for her waist and titian for her head for she was shaped like a dutch cheese and her locks were as red as a carrot   col i have sent for him and as i shall examine him closely in order to search if there be any latent seeds of ability which culture may bring forth i wish you mandeville to be present and that you will also assist me in the inquiry   man certainly as my cousin i think it a duty i owe him  oh here he comes with johnson   enter caleb and johnson call speaks as entering you dont know what is taste my hairs the nattiest thing in town as it is dressed now   call dont you know sir i sent for you   ca ah father  cousin are you there too   man you dont attend   ca attend no i hope i shall not attend anymore  well father you sent for me now what do you want my old cock   col turning away with disgust it is in vain to think of cultivating a soil like this   man his manner is terrible to be sure but we must correct him   ca correct him why what have i done to be corrected i thought i was corrected enough by my last father   col would that correction had taught you to speak   ca that it did and often to squeak too till you could hear me two streets off   col speak to him mandeville  there is something so barbarous in every thing he says or does that i cannot bear to look at him   man you will excuse me dear cousin for giving you a little advice but as i mean it well i am sure you will not be offended   ca bless your heart you cannot offend me i am one of the besttemperd boys breathing  but what is the matter with old firelock he seems in the sulks   man he is not pleased with your manner and address it is too rude and abrupt you should never approach him without evident marks of respect   ca oh i understand you i should always make a bow when i come into a place where he is  ecod with all my heart but what set me wrong was hearing it said that to have no manners at all was the best of breeding   man ceremony is altogether as ridiculous as udeness is offensive you must avoid both   col have you ever read any thing in your life   ca why do you think i cannot read then i tell you i can and write and cipher too   man he does not doubt that he only wishes to know what kind of reading or books you are fond of   ca then you may tell him i am fond of histories   man that is a good hearing faith if he is fond of history he must possess from nature a strong inquisitive mind under all this unpromising dabord men educated in a low sphere of life however uncouthly they express themselves often manifest a strong intellect and on being put to the test discover a fund of knowledge the bettereducated man would not expect from a slight acquaintance with them i consider such minds like rich metals as yet unpurifyd from alloy but let it once be known that the ore is gold and the refiners hand will soon bring forth the bullion  as you are fond of history you have no doubt dipped into the histories of greece and rome   ca the best of their histories   man whose were they   ca why in the first place i have read don bellianiss history of greece and the seven wise masters history of rome   col ask him no more questions   ca then i have read the history of colonel jack and the history of the english rogue and the history of moll flanders   man he appears as well read in modern as ancient history   col i dont know any thing more mortifying to human pride than to pass the better part of a mans life in toil anxiety and danger accumulating wealth to leave it to a fool at last   ca you cannot think father how sensible money makes a fool look and how foolish a wise man looks without it   enter servant serve mr serge your honors tailor   man he is come to take measure of my cousin for his regimentals

  ca why if you was to cry out as thus now caleb bawling out i should cry coming up sir though you made a duke of me    exit caleb col well mandeville what do you think   man hope is left us in the worst of times however i do not despair of making something of him yet what i dread most is introducing him to charlotte   col why cannot man make over his mind like his property to his children any distinguishing quality in all other animals survives in the same species by hereditary descent for ever man continues upon the earth only in his name and his revenues  oh that he should leave behind

mandeville is an officer of infinite merit he was my prisoner during the war and is warmly attached to english manners and our glorious constitution  but creveit  to know the merit of such a man you must be acquainted with him   man is he an englishman   col yes and you may judge of his merit as a soldier when i tell you he has risen from the ranks at the age of three and twenty to the commission he now holds of captain he is the reverse of this illfated boy we have been speaking to he is selfeducated for with scarce any advantages but those he derived from a most noble and excellent nature he is the man of sense the scholar and the polished gentleman his father old crevelt was no more than a sergeant and served in germany under lord granby he brought this young man with him to india whilst yet a boy the first day he ever was in action he saw his father fall and he was found after the battle amongst the slain close to his body apparently lifeless with loss of blood as if he had died in

act act iii scene mandevilles house enter mandeville crevelt and colonel talbot crevelt i quitted england mr mandeville when a boy and never was in london in my life before i am charmed with the appearance of this noble city in which the ease convenience and safety of its poorest inhabitant seem consulted   col there is no token seen in the streets of an exhausted people drained by a tedious and expensive war during which great britain fought at more unequal odds than any nation on the earth ever did before   crev so much the reverse that i am astonished at the appearance of opulence and prosperity to be met with every where and the pleasing sensation i feel to find my country in that state is indescribable   col let gloomy politicians continue to predict and foresee calamities that exist only in imagination whilst the genius of industry continues to smile upon the labors of the husbandman the mechanic and the manufacturer and whilst strict probity is the character of england in her dealings with all other nations the resources of this country will be found inexhaustible and though its glory may be veiled by a momentary cloud it soon recovers its former splendor   enter caleb

to insult i cannot receive it without indignation even from the son of colonel talbot   col i insist upon your asking that gentlemans pardon   ca why is he a gentleman   col a man of his worth his honor and abilities is a gentleman though sprung in the lowest vale of society   ca nay if you say he is a gentleman i ask his pardon with all my heart nothing so common nowadays as one gentlemans asking pardon of another it makes up a quarrel in a trice   crev sir i accept your apology   col  to caleb but sir i will go farther with you  you must ever consider that man with respect learn to

which if you neglect your provision from me shall be merely independence my name you may disgrace but i think it a crime to bestow riches on one who would abuse them even that youth whose birth is so inferior in your eye i should consider as united to me by his merit in nearer ties of kindred   exit colonel ca strutting about so then i am to be disinherited after all and for an old soldiers son too   crev what is that you say sir   ca say sir  damme he looks so fierce i dont know what to say to him  these old soldiers sons are so used to cutting of throats it is the devil to quarrel with them   man i am ashamed of you cousin  if you proceed in this manner you must be looked up from all society   ca i will beg his pardon again i know that is all he wants   crev i will spare you sir the mortification of descending to so humiliating an act in respect to your father i overlook every thing you have hitherto said  i now coolly behold all that had past through a different medium and rather feel for a youth who from his prospect of immense wealth has been perhaps from his childhood surrounded with sycophants who never let him know what it was to be acquainted with himself and persuaded him into an opinion that wealth supplies the absence of every accomplishment and virtue   ca i dont rightly understand you captain but i fancy only you mince the matter that you meant to say i was much better fed than taught  well no matter  are we good friends again   crev very good   ca then give me your hand aside he he he i cannot help laughing after all to think of such a fellows

quit friends who of all things covet your society is the business which calls you from us of that urgent nature you cannot postpone it for a few days at least   crev it is what i ought not to do  for my relations in england if i have any living have never heard from me since i quitted the country but perhaps it is better to prepare them for the meeting so i shall write to them by this nights post and continue your guest a little longer   man now this is truly friendly  i would nt for the world have you leave town till after my cousin talbots wedding   crev then he is going to be married   man so his father intends as the only means of reforming him the lady is one of those two who came here within this half hour and whom we left with count pierpoint admiring his magnificent present from the different princes of the east at whose courts he has been occasionally envoy   crev but which of the ladies is intended for mr talbot   man charlotte  she whom you so much admired and short as the counts acquaintance with them is he appears already smitten with her cousin harriet  unluckily for him she happens to be engaged   crev but charlotte it is she then who is intended for mr talbot  i think i never saw a finer girl   man she is a divine creature and though her adonis is so near a relation i confess i wish her a better husband  but i dont know how matters may terminate  she is a girl of great spirit  has a a very fine independency and such is her disposition that i am confident there is no temptation in wealth could induce her to marry any man whom she did not like   enter harriet har ha ha ha i beg your pardon mr mandeville for laughing so much at the expense of your cousin talbot but his manner person and conversation are all so truly original that gravity itself must be provoked to laughter in his company   man it is very true harriet he is a most extraordinary being i must confess   han he introduced himself to charlotte this moment and such a figure does he cut he can neither walk sit nor stand still with gazing at his person  charlotte and he are together she seems delighted with him   crev then maam she likes him   har she likes to laugh at him sir  do

yes johnson as you came to london before me i wished to ask you if you knew any thing of the family of this young lady your master intends his son shall marry   johns why sir i understand she is the daughter of a sir oliver oldstock an old acquaintance of the colonels  her father i hear meant she should marry mr mandeville supposing he would be my masters heir but when a son made his appearance like all worldly men sir oliver changed his note and the poor young lady is to become a sacrifice to this  i wish he was not my masters son   crev but she will not johnson be made a sacrifice   johns i hope not sir  but lord what will not money do dont we see money every day couple age and deformity to youth and beauty a young creature like an angel linked to an old skeleton of dry bones  as if the demon of avarice and sin had acquired such ascendancy in the world as to bring about an union betwixt death and immortality   crev why johnson you speak with great feeling and spirit on the subject   johns ah captain crevelt what a charming couple you two would make  i who have seen your honor in the field would expect a granby or a marlborough from such a marriage   crev musing i promised to follow them but the less i see her the better for my peace it is only feeding a passion i should banish from my heart for ever  johnson take no notice that i have asked you any questions concerning miss oldstock should i be inquired for i am gone to the library  books or my own thoughts are the only society i am fit for    exit crev johns well as long as i live i never will think

turn about and let me see your shapes  mercy what a long sword they have tied you to   ca that was all my own thought i havent learnt to sense yet and as i am told a gentleman is nobody till he has fought about a score duels i was determined the first time i fought not to be overreachd by any body   char a very prudent resolution i must confess valor is by no means incompatible with discretion but pray sir are you so very quarrel some that you expect to have all those duels upon your hands   ca me quarrelsome  bless your heart i am as quiet as a lamb   char then why do you expect to fight so much   ca because it is the fashion and you know a man had better be out of the world than out of the fashion   char then i think you are taking an excellent method to have your choice   ca yes fightings quite a gentlemanlike amusement  besides it will be put in the newspapers and i shall read my own name in print along with the debates of lords and commons and that is the cause i suppose of all duels   char i believe duels have been fought more than once  and oh fatal delusion perhaps a valuable life lost for a cause altogether as frivolous   ca but now i am dressed do you see me i wish to show myself to some of my old acquaintances therefore suppose you and i go this evening to bagnigge wells and drink tea  the hot rolls are so nice there you cannot think   char some other time i cannot possibly go this evening   ca mayhap you think i will not pay for the tea but i will and moreover than that i will treat you to the halfplay afterward   char you must indeed excuse me sir

actually rivalld me   ca with great delight dress i see is every thing such a suit of regimentals would make any man a great officer  how this world goes fine fellows are made by tailors and tailors undone by fine fellows   char my narcissus is so engaged with his person it would be foolish to lose this opportunity of getting rid of him i will drop carelessly into the library  i never saw so

contradictions my hobby horse i mount him every hour of the day and he more he kicks and flings the greater delight i ake in riding him  i know you think me a whimsical old fellow but you are new to our clime and our manners  we delight in thinking for ourselves  opposition is the very soul of an englishman  he likes it in himself and in others also peace and prosperity with good eating and drinking would throw him into a lethargy if imagination didnt supply that spur to goad him on constantly to action   count now mon chere pere me ville settle    sir o odso that is right  mind the

how my accounts stand i hay secured the french nabob for my niece now it would be a master stroke if i could obtain the english one for my daughter and thus center the two nabobs in my own family this son of the colonels is a down right savage charlotte never could like him or if she could interest tells me i should not therefore her likings out of the question there is to be a division of the colonels property between the son and mandeville i want the whole if possible the colonels not fifty and in my mind he is a better looking man than either his son or his nephew charlottes having ten thousand pounds independent of me makes her very obstinate debates will run high i fear as indeed they very often do in my family where though i am constantly left in a minority i never lose a question  it is true i have open mouths upon me from all sides till like greater men i am fairly badgerd but it is only waiting till the strangers are all out and i tell the house as i please afterward  zoonds here comes mandeville i wish i could get decently out of his way   enter mandeville man i have been in search of you sir oliver   sir o i wish i had known that i would have saved you a good deal of trouble  well my good sir had you any thing particular to say to me   man is your conduct toward me consistent with honor   sir o i dont understand you   man how convenient it is to assume ignorance of a subject on which it is painful to hear the truth even to the man incapable of respecting it honor though shut out from the heart will still knock at its gates and tell the guilty there is a register kept in the avenging court of remorse for every act of injustice   sir o upon my word mr mandeville you speak to me in a very strange style this is not a manner in which i am accustomed to be addressed you bounce in all of a sudden transported with rage for what cause is best known to yourself and with a knockmedown countenance treat me as if my age and my rank had no kind of respect due to them   man sir no man honors age more than i or more readily yields rank every respect it can claim when that rank does not forfeit its title to esteem by meanly sinking and degrading itself  but when men in superior stations behave as if their actions were above all censure and control they must be told that they are deceiving themselves as well as the world and that no man is suffered to injure another with impunity   sir o well sir in what particular have i injured you to provoke the thunder of this terrible phillipic   man can you seriously ask me that question when you sanction the addresses of count pierpoint to your niece   sir o well and what then   man have you forgot your prior engagement to me   sir o mr mandeville the poet says that every days a satire on the last now i say that every days a contradiction to the last as circumstances vary or events fall out we are compelled by necessity to change our minds as to my niece whom i consider in the light of a daughter i think it my duty in providing her with a husband to make the best bargain i can for her   man sir have you no regard to what the world will say on this occasion the world sir that harsh blind misjudging multitude whose slander if it soil the ermine purity of virtue what will it say when it has justice upon its side   sir o nothing that i value  young man when you have lived as many years with the world as i have you will learn to make your happiness independent of its opinion  dont you see knaves and fools every day rise into consequence and all from the opinion of the world  the opinion of the world sir it is a mouthful of moonshine   man i believe with you that the world is too indolent  too much occupied with its pleasures or its miseries to take up the business of a censor  i fear it never examines thoroughly any mans pretensions to its favor the more he asks the more he generally obtains from the world hence folly confidence and vice revel in the arms of luxury whilst merit proud and retiring from the conscious dignity of genius and virtue is suffered to perish for want of bread  but sir    sir o but me no more this debate mr mandeville  the question is put and i am going  partial as i am to a polemical mode of discourse i find that there may be sometimes even too much contradiction   exit man what shall i do with this deceitful unfeeling man but can i hesitate whilst i have a particle of spirit left i will go this moment state the matter to count pierpoint and he shall resign or fight for his mistress   enter harriet har dear mandeville what is the matter  my uncle has just parted from you seemingly much out of temper and the wildness and disorder of your looks terrify me   man my heart is torn to pieces harriet  indignation at the ungenerous treatment i have met with from your uncle added to my fears of losing you distract me   har but can you doubt your harriet there is no power upon earth shall force me to
