preface i am sensible that this performance will come into the world much more imperfect than i at first thought it would but i have labored under so many difficulties in the compiling of it that when but a few of them are mentioned i hope for a candid and favorable judgment  after i had collected in private what materials i could i was then obliged to go publicly in quest of more upon this i published an advertisement desiring the assistance of such as had ancient writings or deeds or any other things that might contribute to the helping of the work  this immediately occasioned the following reflections that it might be of dangerous consequence to show ancient writings that he was but a curate that undertook the work that his abilities therefore of pocket and mind must be vastly unequal to such a task in short above    months before the publication of it some have made it their business so great has been their ill nature and prejudice as to take all ways and methods of decrying it by print by manuscript lessening it in all companies to hinder it is publication and speaking as freely of of it as if they were acquainted with every line of it is composition and by a prophetic spirit knew it to be as they talked of it  by these means i am certain i have been hindered of many materials  but there are two grand disappointments i met with in the compiling of this performance which must not be untaken notice of the one is my not being so happy as to see dr ellisons collection of the antiquities of this town a few indeed were sent me but having the same copy from mr douglas they were of no service and excepting these i saw no more it is to be hoped as the dr must have made a large collection having been about it as is said for many years that the present possessor of them will oblige the town with the publication of them and cure the imperfections of the present performance  the other disappointment is the not meeting with those large collections of sir robert shaftoe taken notice of by bishop nicholson in his english historical library i endeavored after a sight of them but they were then either lost or so mislaid that there was no coming at them  and if i add to all this an illness of many months and which it pleases god still to continue the author did live but few months after he wrote this preface dying feb         which too frequently obliges me to trust the copies of others and depend upon them i hope a few errors and failings will fall gently to my share  however in the midst of all this malice and ill nature and these disappointments there were some so communicative and generously assisting as to give all the help they could they are the gentlemen following  mr josuah douglas who assisted me with a great number of materials john milbank esquire who sent me a manuscript which is frequently mentioned chrstopher hunter of durham m d who has obliged me in the kindest manner with several curious manuscripts which

account of the roman walls in the country of the ottadini particularly the walls of hadrian and severus which went through this town the most ancient name of this town it was about an hundred years after the landing of julius caesar in this island when the brigantes a populous and warlike nation of the britains whose country extended from the north of humber to the river tyne containing the present counties of yorkshire durham lancashire westmoreland and cumberland were first assaulted by the romans the britains behaved themselves in the war with great courage and resolution till at last in the reign of vespasian the greatest part of them were conquered after this in the reign of titus julius agricola the lieutenant of britain who was at least equally famous for his conquests over the customs and manners of the britains as for his many victories over them in battle did in the third year of his lieutenancy make a discovery of other parts of this island which were not brought under the roman yoke upon which he marched northward into the country of the ottadini which extends from the north of tyne to the river taus wasting and destroying all before him till he came to the tay it self and now according to some was the first wall made in britain but it was not properly a wall it was only a line of garrisons placed upon that slip of land between edinburghfrith and dunbritainfrith for the security of what they had already gained and if the valor of agricolas army and the renown of the roman name could have suffered it there was no need of a further search after the bounds and limits of britain the friths abovementioned called then glota and bodotria might have been very sufficient being the arms of two opposite seas and only separated by a small space of land which was well fortified with the roman garrisons so that the romans were lords of the whole south and had cast the enemy as it were into another island tacit in vit agricol  but what could ever bound the roman glory and limit their never satisfied ambition it was not enough that they had entirely secured themselves for any attempts of the caledonians but they also were to be subdued this was effected in the  th year of agricolas lieutenancy in the reign of domitian  however after this cambd that further part of the island was left to the the inhabitants went naked had no houses to live in neither did they till the ground as one writes de praeda and venatione frondibusque arborum vivant degent in tentoriis nudi and sine calceis gray ex xiphilin barbarians as neither pleasant nor fruitful but this nether part was fairly reduced to a roman province which was not governed by consular or proconsular deputies but was counted praesidial and appropriate to the caesars as being a province annexed to the empire after the division of provinces made by augustus and having propraetors of its own  hadrian who was made emperor about the year of our lord     made the second wall cambd he drew a wall says spartian of eighty miles in length to divide the barbarians from the romans which one may gather from what follows in spartian to have been in the fashion of a mural hedge of large stakes fixed deep in the ground and fastened together with wattles the same authority from the scotch historian who wrote the rota temporum tells us that hadrian did first of all draw a wall of a prodigious bigness made of turf of that height that it looked like a mountain and with a deep ditch before it from the mouth of the tyne to the river eske i e from the german to the irish ocean this is supposed to have been done about the year      the cambd third wall was built by lollius urbicus lieutenant of britain under antoninus pius about the year     who by his great success removed back the bounds to where julius agricola had set them and raised a wall there  the cambd fourth wall was that of this emperor died at york about the year     feb  th severus which was built about the year of christ   0 which extended from sea to sea quite cross the island this was a wall of stone built much about the same place where the wall of hadrian was it had it is beginning at bulness on the irish sea and crossing the island went as far as wallsend a village about   miles east of newcastle  a cambd fifth wall was built between the two arms or bosoms of the seas for many miles together that where the waters did not defend them the wall might be a security against the incursions of the enemy this wall was made by carausius governor of britain in the reign of dioclesian and stood in the same place where lollius urbicus had built his  this being finished the romans left the britains to their own valor and conduct being called away for the defense of gaul but no sooner were they gone than their enemies returned and slew all before them upon this they sent ambassadors to rome to solicit the assistance of the romans which was granted them for valentinian sent three companies under the conduct of gallio of ravenua who routed the enemy and relieved the province after this cambd p    ex gild they made a wall of stone not raised at the public and private costs as the other was with the help of the poor natives built after the usual manner quite cross the country from one sea to another by those cities which were perhaps built there for fear of the enemy they exhorted them to be courageous and left them patterns to make their weapons by upon the southren shore of britain also where their ships lay because the barbarous enemy might enter there they built turrets at some distance from one another that looked a long way to the sea and so the romans intending never to return more about the four hundred seventy sixth year from the coming of julius caesar took their last farewell  this last wall according to bid was eight foot broad and twelve foot high and stood in the place where the walls of hadrian and severus had stood cambd it had great number of towers or little castles a mile one from another called now castlesteeds and on the inside a sort of fortified little towns called chesters the inhabitants tell you there was also a brazen trumpet or pipe whereof they now and then find pieces so artificially laid in the wall between each castle and tower that upon the apprehension of danger at any single place by the sounding of it notice might be given to the next then to the third and so on  these are all the walls of the romans and that three of them went through this town is something more than probable for severuss wall was in the place of hadrians and the last wall mentioned in the place of severuss and that last wall went through this town mr camden is so sure of this that he declares it is most certain that the rampire and afterward the wall passed through this town and that at pandongate there still remains as it is thought one of the little turrets of that very wall there is indeed to this very day a part of that turret in being above pandongate which as the same authority justly observed is different from the rest both in fashon and masonry and undoubtedly carrys along with it a very great age  near this turret is the wallknoll a very ancient place which our historian gray says positively was a part of the pictswall and indeed the very name of it speaks as much for the word wall upon the knoll which signifies an hill or eminence cannot be understood of any other than the romanwall because it had this name from very ancient times long before the building of the townwall to which it almost adjoins  a little above this place is a tower commonly called the vide wallknoll tower carpenterstower this was one of the romantowers as was very visible before the taking down of the upper part of it lib de rebus novocast for it was of the same size model and stone with the tower of this village is now in the possession of john rogers esquire of newcastle who has turned the inner part of the tower into modern rooms but left the walls of it still entire rutchester in northumberland which was undoubtedly one of the roman towers by the pictswall  it must also not be omitted that there is an ancient tradition among the inhabitants of this town that the romanwall went through the westgate and the vicars garden along that ground where st nicholaschurch now stands along netherdeanbridge by the wallknoll sallyport and so on to wallsend  now to these reasons and authorities let us add what hollins descrip of brit p     hollinshead says where he gives an account of the course of the romanwall it begins he says at bolness upon burgh and so he brings it from place to place till he brings it to rutchester then to heddon then to wallbottle then to a small village about   miles west from newcastle belonging to john rogers esquire denton and to newcastle where it is thought st nicholas church stands on the same  to this i shall add the authority of a manuscript i am obliged to a very worthy johnmilbank esquire gentleman for hadrian built a wall of turff or sods from the seaside beyond carlisle unto tinmouth it was demolished after he was gone and after him severus built near the same a wall of stone and made towers and watching places at every miles end and a passage all along by the help of an horn or such an instrument that they might speak through the wall and tell where the enemy was this ended at the river of tyne near wallsend this authority goes on i my self have seen it at thirlwall and it comes by portgate near stanchebank by halton near the longlane where both the walls are apparent as also at denton over bonwellhill down to the westgate and he also adds you may see it down the hill by mr this house was in pilgrimstreet on the west side a little before you come to silverstreet leonard carrs house and over walkermoor to it has been a vulgar error in many who from the name wallsend have imagined that the wall did actually end at that village but it could never have been so because that place is half a mile from the river side it is therefore not presumable that the romans would have begun or ended the wall but at the side of the said river seeing all to the eastward of this place the river was the continuation of the praetentura or fence from hindering the northerly incursions the first track is half a mile south from wallsend near cousinss house beginning a little to the east of it at the side of the river tyne and here certainly the  st station of segedunum was originally placed for     paces a saint track of the wall appears running north twelve degrees and a half westerly then forms an angle pointing south westerly for     paces to the abovementioned mansion of cousinss house about     paces west of this the fossa begins to appear pretty distinct measuring about  0 foot in breadth and a little beyond it is the foundation of the stone wall from hence it passes by a few houses called the beehouses next through a small village called walker here the fosta is  0 foot broad beyond which the foundation of the stonewall appears plain then it ascends the bykerhill running betwixt the village of byker and the windmill thence going down the hill passes through the euesburn crossing the rivulet there then i found it ascend the high ground to the westward of it passing by the mansion house and through the garden to the redbarnes from thence it is visible through the fields going straight to the sallyport gate of newcastle gordon itiner septent p  0  this place where the end of the wall is belongs to mr henry waters of newcastle   wallsend  thus i think it very clear that these romanwalls went through this town let us now see what this town was in these ancient times p     mr cambden gives his opinion thus gateside is commonly believed to be of greater antiquity than newcastle it self and if i should say further that this and newcastle for they seem formerly to have been only one town parted by the river were that frontiergarrison which in the times of the later emperors was called gabrosentum and defended by the second cohort of the thraces and that it retained it is old name in a due sense and signification notwithstanding this newcastle has changed it is name once or twice i hope it will be no ways inconsistent with truth for gaffr is used by the britains for a goat and hen in composition for pen which signifies an head and in this very sense and meaning it is plainly called caprae caput or goatshead by our old latin historians  thus far this learned antiquary but notwithstanding this his judgment and that no tolerable reason can be brought against the two places having been but one yet some will still have it that gateside exclusive of newcastle is the ancient gabrosentum because of it is name for my part i cannot help being of mr cambdens opinion and for this among other reasons that if the name of caprae caput discovers the gabrosentum then it is more probable that the principal part of it lay on the northside of the river than on the south because gabrosentum was one of these frontier garrisons which lay ad lineam valli within the very range of the wall for all these garrisons ad lineam valli were placed on the same side of the river with the wall it self consequently gateside could but at most have been a part of gabrosentum and the meanest part of it too a sort of suburbs to it as it actually was to this town of newcastle in the reign of edward the sixth as shall be shown hereafter  but if this is not allowed and yet it must be allowed if gateside has it is name from the gabrosentum yet most certainly it was a vide chap of the upper parts of the town garrisoned fort in these very times for still there is the remains of a roman turret and the under part of one of the roman towers to be seen and the name of pandon is no small corroboration of the truth of it as may be seen in our account of that place  thus i think whatever is boasted of the antiquity of gateside it plainly appears that if caprae caput or gateside points out the ancient gabrosentum newcastle must be her elder sister forasmuch as a town must be earlier than it is suburbs and if it does not newcastle is by mr cambden called the old gabrocentum where the  d cohort of the thracians lay but according to the course of the forts in the notitia imperii gabrocentum is the seventeenth station on the wall if therefore we follow the noticia strictly newcastle would rather seem to be the ponsaelii the  d station on the wall where the cohort of the cornovii lay in this i have the concurring opinion of the learned and judicious antiquary dr hunter of durham gord itin septent page    the ancient orrhea mentioned by ptolomy has been thought by some to have been the original of this town but for what reason i know not   point it out it will then be a certain conclusion that there is an indisputable account of this town in these very times of the romans which was some hundreds of years before caprae caput or gateside is mentioned by the most early of our latin historians  chap ii of this town after the time of the romans after the departure of the romans it seems to have changed it is name as i shall show immediately and probably by the latter part of it is after name monkchester it was a place of defense or garrisoned fort during the times of the saxons and danes this name of monkchester it retained till after the conquest thus we are told from simeon dunelmensis a monk of the church of durham that newcastle upon tyne was anciently called monkchester civitas monachorum or the town of the monks not because it belonged to the monks but because the monks of those parts dwelt there ex collect mr j douglas   some are of opinion that newcastle got it is name of monkchester because the monks in time of danger came for protection to it and not from their inhabiting it this is quite contrary to the authority abovementioned and all others that i have met with mr eachard in his history of england says that monkchester was so called from certain monks who lived there in great austerity and retirement and the monasticon gives us the following account in the year  0   there was a certain man in the province of the mercians a presbyter and prior of the monastery of winchelescumbe who was a monk whose name was aldwin this man preferred a voluntary poverty and contempt of the world to all it is honors and riches and having learned from the history of the northumbers that that land was formerly famous for multitudes of monks and religious men who though in the flesh lived not according to the flesh but whilst they were on earth had their conversation in heaven he desired greatly to visit the monasteries of these places though he knew they were forsaken and left desolate and there to lead a poor life in imitation of them coming therefore as far as the monastery of evesham he made known his purpose to certain of the brethren upon which two of them associated with him one of them was named elfwie who was a deacon and after that a priest the others name was renifrid he was ignorant of letters these the abbot gave leave to accompany him but not till he had set aldwin over them and committed to him the care of their souls after this they set forward on their journey a foot having an ass to carry their books necessaries and their sacerdotal vestments to celebrate divine service in at length they came to york desiring of hugh the son of baldrick who was then sheriff ut eis ducem itineris inveniret usque locum qui monkcester i e monachorum civitas appellatur nunc novumcastellum nominatur quo per ductum venientes ad tempus ibidem sunt morati ubi nullum antiquum sanctorum christi reperirunt vestigium dugd mon tom   p      that he would procure them a guide to monkchester that is the city of the monks which is now called newcastle whither being brought by their guide they staid awhile but found not any remains of it is former sanctity no footsteps of the religious people who had formerly dwelt there walcher bishop of durham hearing of this sent for them and gave them the monastery of jarray which at that time was unroofd and had scarce any thing remaining of it is ancient grandeur  and now how long it had been in this desolate condition we may gather from mag brit nov and antiq ex holbius hollingshead by the invasion of the danes says he the churches and monasteries throughout northumberland were so waisted and ruined that a man could scarcely find a church standing at this time in all that country and as for those that remained they were all covered with broom or thatch and as for any abbey or monastery there was not one left in all the country neither did any man for the space of two hundred years take care for the repairing or building up of any thing in decay so that the people of this county knew not what a monk meant and if they saw any they wondered at the strangeness of the sight one place there was in this county famous for being the habitation of monks from whence it was called monkchester but that also was so ruinated and destroyed that when the monks of mercia the monks mentioned before came to it they found no token or remnant of any religions persons who had had an habitation there all was defaced and gone  now with respect to monkchester this seems to be punctually true for as hollingshead observes that it was about  00 years from the ruin of the monasteries to this time after the conquest anno  0    so it must be taken notice of that the danes in the year hollin     which was the  th of the reign of king alured divided themselves so that king haldon with one part thereof went into northumberland and lay in the winter season near he sat down with his men at tamesmouth which is between gateside and whickham sim dunel to the river of tyne where he divided the country amongst his men and remained there for the space of two years and oftentimes fetched thither booties and preys out of the country of the scots and picts  it appears then from this that the monasteries of monkchester had been in ruins about  00 years that is to say from the year     to the year  0   the time of the coming of the mercian monk  let us now see if we can form any probable conjecture when it was first inhabited by monks and got the name of monkchester and this i imagine happened toward the later end of the  th century for in the year     the monastical life was brought in among the northumbers by aidan who was that year made bishop of northumberland and had his seat at lindisfern is a small island on the northern shore of england made only by swelling tides for at ebb it is joined to the main land of england by a ridge of sandy earth it is as we are informed called the holyisland from it is first bishop living in an holy society with his clergy he died aug   st anno     and was buried in the church of lindisfern he was succeeded by finan a monk of the monastery of hy who died feb    in the year  0  coleman succeeded him and was bishop about   years but being worsted in the controversy about the keeping of easter he gave up his bishopric and left lindisfern tuda succeeded him and died the same year he was made after this the sea was vacant fourteen years and then filled up by eata in the year     who continued till the year     being then chosen to the sea of hagustald he was succeeded by st cuthbert who was consecrated at york by theodore archbishop of canterbury upon easter day which happened march    the archbishop was assisted by seven other bishops and king egfrid and many of his nobles were present when he had been bishop about two years he gave up his charge and foreseeing his death approaching he resigned his bishopric and retired to his former solitude the island of fern where he died in two months time viz march the  0th     and was buried at lindisfern eadbert was chosen after him he governed the sea about ten years and died in the year     eadfrith or egfrith succeeded him who is said to have wrote a very fine book with his own hand containing the gospels in latin which ethelwold his successor adorned with gilding and jewels bilfrid the anchorite painted and aldred the priest enlarged with an interlineary version in the saxon tongue my authority says further that this very book is still preserved in the cottonlibrary  this famous library had the misfortune this last year      to be set on fire and part of it and its manuscripts were burnt but we hope this valuable piece of antiquity has escape  this bishop died anno     and was succeeded by ethelwold after the sea had been vacant near three years he died in the year   0 keneuif or kenulf succeeded him the same year who died in the year     henulf was succeeded by higbaldus who died may the twenty fifth  0  ecgbert succeeded him who was consecrated by eanbald archbishop of york eanbert bishop of hagustald and baldulf bishop of whithern at bigwell june   th  0  he died anno     heathured succeeded him and died anno   0 ecgredus was his successor who died in the year     he was succeeded by eanbert who died in the year     eardulph succeeded him this bishop left lindisfern in the year     on account of the invasion of the danes and wandered up and down for some years at length he and his company fixed at cunacestre now called

under this jurisdiction it continued till the reign of king henry the  st when the town of hexam and the church anno      were taken from the diocese of durham and given to that of york the king being highly displeased with ranulph bishop of durham  ex mag brit p     this church at the time it was built was supposed to exceed all the churches on this side the alps for it is pillars porches and allies leading round it afterward in the time of bishop acca that bishop superadded to the buildings of his church many decorations and curious works he got from all parts some relics of the apostles and martyrs and erected several altars in reverence to them and for that end made distinct porches in the walls of the church he also with great diligence and no small charge gathered the histories of of their sufferings with many volumes of ecclesiastical writers and of them he made a very large library he also provided several sacred utensils as flaggons cups pattens candlesticks and other vessels of the like nature which belong to the service of god he also brought a famous chorister who had been taught to sing in the church of canterbury whose name was maban to instruct those of his church of hexam mag brit ex bed lib   c    he is also said to have gilded the walls with gold and silver and covered the altars with purple and silk  that part of this church which is now standing for the west end of it is entirely demolished is still grand and noble and speaks what it was in ancient days about   years ago it was repaired by contribution no small part of which was raised in the town of newcastle  this church was honored with the sepulcher of the good king alfwold who was murdered by sigga a certain nobleman at silcester some remains of which place are yet to be seen on the west side of the north tyne in the grounds belonging to walwick grainge between that place and the roman wall rich and lies buried under the arch at the south end of the north east isle a monument is erected since the foundation in honor of that prince rich p     stav p     ex richard pri hagulst de stat eccl stavely in his history of churches gives us the following account that privilege which i read to have been granted unto the church of the once eminent monastery of hagulstad is very remarkable that is there were   crosses set up at a certain distance from the church in the four ways leading thereto now if any malefactor flying for refuge to that church was taken or apprehended within the crosses the party that took or laid hold on him there did forfeit two hundredh in hundredh viii librae continentur if he took him within the town then he forfeited four hundredh if within the walls of the church yard then six hundredh if within the church then twelve hundredh if within the doors of the quire then eighteen hundredh besides penance as in case of sacrilege but if he presumed to take him out of the stone chair near the altar called fridstol or from amongst the holy relics behind the altar the offense was not redeemable with any sum but was then become sine emendatione botolos i e bootles vid gloss w somner and nothing but the utmost severity of the offended church was to be expected by a dreadful excommunication beside what the secular power would impose for the presumptuous misdemeanour  the canons dug mon vol ii p    regular of this church which were appointed by thomas the  d archbishop of york about the year   0  continued till they were displaced by king henry the  th anno      when the revenues of the monastery was valued at     l    s   d it was of the augustine order several rents were paid to it out of the town of newcastle  it is still very stately and magnificent and by far exceeding any thing in that town it is now inhabited by sir edward blacket bart but is the property of walter blacket esquire among the eminent persons of this place i meet with two in particular stephen addit vol   p  0  the  st is john of hexam born in that place and first monk then prior of the monastery there he was a man grave modest meek courteous assable yet severe and rigid in punishing the faults of those under his charge learned and eloquent and a diligent searcher of history and antiquities and though he taught philosophy and divinity publicly in his monastery yet in private he as much as time would permit read historians and particularly venerable bede he made an addition of    years to the history of simeon of durham beginning at the  th year of king henry the  d and proceeding to the first of king richard calling it an history of    years he also writ of signs and comets a description of the scottish war sermons and some other things and flourished in    0  the other is richard of hexam first monk and then prior of that monastery educated there in monastical and school learning and in all sorts of piety so diligently imitated his master john prior of that place that he succeeded him in that employment and in teaching when made prior he in all things most exactly copied after his said master for though he in public taught his brethren philosophy and divinity yet in private he read history and accurately writ the affairs of his time especially in england by the titles the actions of king stephen the actions of king henry the  d and proceeding to the  st of king richard the war of the standard a short chronicle from adam to henry the emperor of the state and bishops of the church of hexam he died and was buried in his monastery about the year        hexam was made a bishopric in the year     and had eata for its first bishop churches and monasteries were built in several places and religion flourished in this whole kingdom this account hollingshead gives in the following words great numbers of persons daily offered themselves to be baptized insomuch that within the space of   days as is left in writing aidan christened    thousand persons of the which no small part forsaking the world betook themselves to a solitary kind of life thus by continual preaching the gospel in that country it came to pass in the end that the faith was generally received of all the people and such zeal to advance the christian religion daily increased amongst them that no where could be found greater hereupon were no small number of churches built in all places abroad in those parts by procurement of king oswold all men liberally consenting according to the rated substance to be contributors toward the charges by this means the kingdom of the northumbers flourished as well in fame of increase of religion as also in civil policy and prudent ordinances  when now it is considered that the business of religion went on so briskly throughout the whole kingdom of the northumbers it is rational to suppose that this place as it was not only convenient for the monastical life as to retirement but also a security to it too being at that time a garrisoned fort was certainly as early inhabited by the monks as the abovementioned time and besides if we consider the veneration it is mentioned with by many historians for the severe rigid lives of it is monks how it was the most eminent place in the north for the monastical life so very famous on that account as to change it is former name to that of monkchester there can scarce be allowed it a later time to arrive at such a pitch of eminency and glory before the name of monkchester i imagine from it is being a place of fortification that it had the name of chester as weremuth was the original name of that place but was afterward called monkweremuth from the monks inhabiting there it seems all along to have been a place of defense and fortification it was the ancient gabrosentum according to mr cambden or as others more justly imagine the pons aelii of the romans was a garrisoned fort till inhabited by the monks and was such from the time of the monks till the conquest  the name of monkchester continued till the building of the castle and after that from the building of it it got the name of new castle the occasion of which was this malcolme king of scotland having entered with his army into the confines of england came with it into northumberland and waisted and plundered the whole country as far as the river tyne the conqueror being all the while in normandy and also his son robert curtois but no sooner were the king and his son come into england than robert was sent with an army against malcolme to drive him out of the country the scots being apprizd of this retired into their own country and robert with his army encamped upon the banks of the tyne where he built the castle to defend these northern parts from the incursions of the scots for the mag brit p  0  poly virg etc future the chronicle of mailros says that the conqueror sent his son robert into scotland against malcolme in the year  0 0 who having done nothing upon his return built the new castle from hence it is easy to conclude that the castle was founded the same year toward the latter end of it for dugdale tells us in his monasticon that anno domini mlxxx rex willielmus autumnali tempore robertum fillium suum contra malcomum misit sed cum pervenisset ad egglesbreth nullo consecto negotio reversus castellum novum super flumen tynae condidit dug mon tom   p    king william in the year  0 0 about the time of autumn sent his son robert into scotland against malcolme but having got as far as egglesbreth he returned having done no exploit and built the new castle upon the river tyne  thus the town lost it is name of monkchester for that of newcastle which it retains to this day but however by the building of the castle it lost nothing else for the building of the said castle did not destroy or take away the right or interest which the townsmen had before but that still remained as before  after this the town grew more populous and increased in trade and wealth had great privileges granted them by the kings built churches monasteries walls bridges etc as shall be seen in the following treatise  chap iii of the walls of this town new castle is seated on the northern bank of the river tyne and is bounded on the east by the land of byker on the west by the lands belonging formerly to the prior of tinemouth on the north by the lands of kenton and coxlodge and on the south by the county of durham  it is surrounded with a stonewall which at the time it was built and for many ages after was undoubtedly of very great strength this has several gates belonging to it round towers and square turrets which shall by and by be considered on the outside of it is a ditch or trench and on the inside it is ramperd with earth  gray the cause of building this great wall was the often invasion of the scots into this place and country they continually infested it and the rich monasteries in these northern parts the religious houses of this town and the adjacent places being above forty  some are of opinion that the walls were begun in the reign of king henry the third but the author just now mentioned imagines them to have been earlier king john he says gave great privileges to this town and probably the newgate and walls thereabout were built in his time the north part of the wall being the oldest and of another fashion than the other walls  in the reign of king henry the  d the same author says the west part of the wall was built but i am rather inclined to believe that that part of the wall was not built till the reign of edward the  st the wall from the time it was begun went on but slowly till this reign when an accident happened which revived the former fears of the townsmen and put them in mind of the neglected wall which till that time had got no farther than evertower as appears by the old part of the wall ending thereabouts the accident was this cambden in the reign of edward the  st a very rich burgher being carried off a prisoner by the scots out of the middle of the town first paid a round ransom himself and afterward began the  st fortifications of the place  it is true that this accident was the occasion of carrying on the wall but mr cambden is mistaken in saying it occasioned the beginning of it for it was begun some years before the reign of edward the  st for from newgate to the evertower as has just now been observed is a work older and vastly different from what the wall is from evertower toward the westgate this wall leading to the westgate was it which was begun in the reign of edward the  st for in this reign it was when leave was granted to the preaching friars to break out that little gate which now leads into the wardensclose then their garden that this wall was called the vid durhamtower and blackfriars newwall and surely a newwall will imply that there was an old one before was the thing itself not still a matter of fact as it really is to any observer  how long the walls were a building or who they were in particular that contributed toward the building of them is a matter pretty much in the dark however it is gardener chap    this author whose name was ralph gardener lived at chirton a village east of newcastle near the town of shields which village is now in the possession of robt lawson and edward collingwood esqrs he was a bitter enemy to this town and did all the mischief to it that lay in his power as appears in every page of his book in which are numbers of falsities   supposed that king edward the  st was a contributor to them the names of some of the roundtowers also give us some light which to this day do seemingly bear the names of their ancient founders which may in some measure occasion a guess at the time of their building  the town after the completing of the walls was divided into    wards according to the number of the gates and round towers in the wall which towers and gates were wont be defended in times of hostility with the scots by the particular wards appropriated to them  the  st gate i shall begin with is the closegate which is so called because it stands in a narrow street called the close it had in ward from the closegate upon the southrawe so going eastward unto the javilgrippe but nothing of javilgrippe then going westward upon the north unto the closegate  from the closegate there are stairs leading up to a roundtower called the whitefryertower this tower had in ward from the east end of bailiffgate opposite to the javilgrippe with all that dwell upon the highstairs in the close unto and with the west side of these stairs that lead unto the southpostern of the castle with all javilgrippe eastward and from the javilgrippe to the southrawe of the close and with all the bridgeend  this tower with the wall leading to the little gate commonly called the posterngate but originally the gate of the whitefryers or whitefryergate were together with the gate itself probably built by the whitefryers for the whitefryers were situated in the southwestend of the street of westgate in the same grounds were are now the houses of mr anderson george gray esquire and others and as it is reasonable to believe that whatever religious house or nobleman built a tower or piece of the wall that it would be built chiefly for their own security so the buildings now mentioned being so situated as i have just now observed are a proof that the whitefryers were the founders and if it be considered that the whitefryers were see whitefryers founded by king edward the  st in whose reign the abovementioned accident happened which occasioned a fresh beginning of building of the wall it will appear still more probable that these friars were the builders it may indeed be said that as they were sounded in this reign it cannot be imagined they had sufficient riches for such an undertaking this is readily granted but when it is considered that these friars were newly founded by king edward the  st that they were the first of that order that had been in this place that they were carmelites or originally coming from mount carmel in syria and that the prayers of all monasteries were thought more particularly available for the souls in purgatory it will follow i think rationally that they were more able then to do such a thing by getting the contributions of others than they could have been of themselves  00 years after the name given to these walls is also another argument it is more probable that the whitefryertower the wall and gate now mentioned were so called as other towers were from their founders than from their bare situation for the walls behind the blackfriars are not called after their name because they were not built by them but by king edward the  st as shall be shown below  this tower is now the meeting house or hall of the company of masons  gray in mentioning the ports or gates of newcastle says there were besides these posterngates belonging to the religious houses i have met with no more than three and this whitefriersgate is undoubtedly one of them it seems to be much of the same kind with that which leads into the wardensclose it has been an outlet to the friars that they might walk to the forth and the neighboring fields and that it might be of use and service to the castle in times of hostility with the scots i imagine it was out at this gate that the townsmen made that famous sally mentioned by gray who says that in the reign of edward the  d see a more perfect account in the year of the mayors      three hundred valiant men issued out of the town through a posterngate and came suddenly in the night upon a great army of the scots which lay in the west part of the town and raised the army put them to flight and took earl murray prisoner in his tent and others  the next round tower to whitefryergate is dentontower or neviltower which had in ward all the hairyhugh on the south side of the whitefryers with all the houses standing there upon the burnbank betwixt the fryerkirk and a burn unto the stone bridge in bailiffgate with all bailiffgate upward that same raw unto dentonchare with dentonchare  why it was called dentontower i can give no reason unless it was from it is having in ward the lane called dentonchare but it has the name of neviltower from the nevil family of raby who built it which family was honored with the title of earl in the reign of richard the  d ralph nevil lord of raby being created earl of westmoreland in the   st of that reign his house in westgate called westmorelandplace which shall be considered when we treat of that street had this tower built behind it for it is security and defense the tower is now the hall of the wallers bricklayers and plaisterers and was repaired by them anno dom      richard fletcher and william johnson wardens  the next round tower is westspittletower which had in ward the side upon the west raw under the castle moat from the castlegate so downward on that raw to and with a great waste belonging to laurentius acton opposite to a corner shop of a chauntery in st johns kirk next the pant also from that pant upwards upon the eastrawe in the side with the south kirkstyle of st nicholas by the east side of st nicholas  this tower has it is name from st mary the virgins hospital which was otherwise called westspittle to which it almost adjoins it must have been built by the master and brethren of that hospital for the same reasons that the other two towers beforementioned were built by their supposed founders  the tower next to this has the name of stanktower it had in ward all now called backrawe gallowgate opposite to the castleyates so going northward from the east end of gallowgate upwards that same raw unto the east end of dentonchare with the ironmarket with all the houses opposite to the ironmarket down to st nicholas pant as their doors open toward the ironmarket or toward the pant or toward st nicholas kirkyard  gunnertower is the next it had in ward from allhallowpant beside cordiner so going downward the same raw toward calecross and so going upwards by that flesherrawe unto painterhugh beside swinburneplace unto a place called pencherplace beyond painterheugh as it stands beyond lorkburne  between this tower and one next to it is a postern which leads to the forth it was made anno   0  when thomas wass esquire was mayor matthew matfin esquire sheriff there is also another passage from it into westgate  pinktower this tower had in ward in the close from the highstairs that lead from the south postern of the castle toward the close so going eastward on that same raw by the northside of sandhill unto and with st marylane with the houses upon the corner called st marylands in allhallowkirk and so going upwards all the westrawe in the side to a great waste upon the castlehugh sometimes called old laurentius actons waste opposite to the pant at lorkburne  westgate is the next which is the highway west into the counties of northumberland and cumberland and is gray said to have been built by roger de thornton in memory that he came from the westcountry according to the old saying at the westgate came thornton in with a hap and a halfpenny and a lambskin   this gate had in ward from the vennel that leads into whitefryerkirk so going upon the west raw of westgate unto the westyate with all that dwell without that yate also from the west end of denton chare so going upward upon the eastrawe of westgate unto the westyate with all that dwell in st johns kirkyard and with all that dwell from the said kirk unto the westgate it is now the hall of the housecarpenters  durhamtower is the next and it had in ward from st johns chare to going upward by urdplace upon the westrawe of beermarket unto the shodfrierchare with all the shodfrier chare  hebertower is the next it had in ward all the mealmarket from dentonchare to puddingchare with all puddingchare and st johns chare  this tower is now the hall of the armourers curriers and feltmakers who were made one fellowship in the   th of henry the  th they were ordered to associate themselves in the feast of corpus christi and go together in procession as other mysteries and sustain the charges of the lights pageant and place on the same feast according to old ancient custom and the ordinance therein was to be devised by their wardens when the hour was assigned upon pain to lose and forfeit one pound of wax to be applied to the use of the whole fellowship of the said occupations the best account i have met with of these kind of plays is of one that was played in the city of coventry step  st v p     before the suppression of monasteries the city of coventry was very famous for the pageants that were played therein upon corpus christi day which occasioning very great confluence of people to it from far and near was of no small benefit thereto which pageants being acted with mighty state and reverence by the franciscanfryers had theaters for the several scenes very large and high placed upon wheels and drawn to all the eminent parts of the city for the better advantage of spectators and contained the story of the old and new testament composed into old english rhimes as appears by an ancient manuscript entitled ludus corporis christi or ludus coventriae that is the play of corpus christi or the play of coventry in bibl cotton sub effigy vesp d    a specimen of them is as follows

the blackfriars is a little gate in the wall which i imagine to be one of those which gray calls posterngates it leads into the wardens close and was made in the reign of king edward the  st the black friars petitioned the king he being then at durham that they might have a passage though his new wall into their garden which was accordingly granted the original grant is still in being with the

that in the corner of the carliol croft now the hall of the weavers who repaired it anno      it got it is name very probably from it is founder for the carlills or carliols were several of them magistrates of newcastle and as this appears probable from the name so it is also equally probable that the founder of this tower had his house somewhere at the head of pilgrimstreet nigh his own tower as nevels tower was behind his house and that the field called vulgarly carling croft had it is name of carliol croft being at that time of day the property of this founder the last mayor of this town of that name before the completion of the walls was nicholas de carliol in the  d year of edward the  d so that this tower could not be much later in building to say the least of it is antiquity imaginable but it is rather probable it was built a good while earlier it has to ward all the east raw of pilgrimstreet within the yate and without the yate from and with the maudlins so coming inward upon the eastraw unto the austinchair  carlillcrofttower otherwise called plummertower it has in ward from the austinchare in pilgrimstreet upon that eastraw of pilgrimstreet unto the

lorkburne all that raw toward calecross to and with the corner called oliverrent and so upward all that corner unto the northend of grindonchare  austintower this tower was built by the friars of st

pampedenyate is so called from the ancient town of pampeden where was the pictswall and a roman turret part of which is still to be seen out of this gate is a causey that goes into a place of recreation and perambulation called the shieldsfield and a way to a village called wallsend is a village fast from newcastle about three miles nigh it was the station of the  st cohort of the fraxagi as the liber notitiarum says which calls the place itself vindobola or as antoninus names it vindomora which last seems in the provincial language of the britons to have signified the wallsend as the later does the rampiersend for they anciently named a wall mur and a ditch or rampire gual or val or bal cambden  but with this a late ingenious author cannot agree because mr cambden brings no proof from inscriptions and also because pancirolus in the same notitia places vindomora at the ninth station per lineam valli where the fourth cohort of the galli lay and which appears by inscriptions to have been the little chesters upon the wall he concludes therefore that where the wall begun which has already been shown the first station of segedunum was certainly placed gord irinerar septontion p  0  the present walsend is a very agreeable place having about it very good grounds and in it some beautiful houses and gardens some of the possessors of which are mr henry waters of newcastle hoastman mr charles atkinson of newcastle hoastman mr thomas waters of newcastle merchant mr james monkcaster of newcastle merchant mr william dixon of newcastle brewer etc  there is a chapel belonging to this village which is very inconveniently situated on the top of an hill the present incumbent is the reverend mr thomas dockwray lecturer of st nicholas in newcastle   walsend by bid villa ad murum this is certainly a mistake for according to mr cambden that was walltown which from the agreeableness of the name and as he goes on it is    miles distance from the eastern sea was the royal burrow which bid calls ad murum  but the learned dr smith upon this passage of bid is of another opinion he says it is commonly supposed to be walton but this he adds cannot be true for it answers not the distance at which bid places the ad murum from the sea but wallbottle both as to it is name and as to it is distance which is not far from newcastle and from the sea about    miles will answer exactly well  but be this is it will certain it is that the ad murum is famous on account that sigebert king of the east saxons and penda king of the mercians together with his whole train of courtiers and attendants were baptized in it by the bishop finanus  one matilda of this village of wallsend had some lands in pampeden confirmed to her at a court held at byker anno       in a charter of william de carilepho bishop of durham which he granted to the monks we have mention made of this place for the bishop is said to have given this and willington to the monks ultra ampnem tinam duas villas wyllynton and walleshend cum suis appendiciis   and so into tinemouthshire this gate had in ward from galewayrent in crossgate beside allhallow pant both the rawes of that crossgate so goingeastward down to the pant called broadchare pant with bellplace that stands upon the pant and with all the broadchare and narrowchare otherwise called collierchare with michaelplace cutting upon the west side of pandonbourne  wallknowltower and habkintower are now but one ward and they have in ward from the broadchare part beside bellplace so going to a burn called cogo both the towers unto the south side cogoburn as it runs beside the stone brig unto pandonburn from pandonyate to the sandgate either in pandon or fishergate or in other places from the said burn eastward with the wards with all that dwell upon north raw in sandgate  this tower commonly called the carpenters tower because the company of carpenters or shipwrights meet in it was one of the towers of the old romans this company in the year      built upon the under part of it a very grand and stately squaretower adorned at the top corners with   fair turrets built in the form of a lanthorn  lib de reb novocast but before the taking down the top of the old tower it was much of the same size model and stone with the tower of routchester in northumberland which was certainly one of the towers belonging to the pictswall  there is under it an ancient posterngate which leads into the field called the garthheads the most part of which was last year enclosed and turned into gardenground by richard ridley esquire the owner of it  from sandgate which is so called because it was built upon the sand or the riverside is a wall having many little gates in it extending itself as far as the merchants hall along the street called the keyside  it must not be forgot what is mentioned in the manuscript of mr john milbank that between every one of these towers there were for the most part   watchtowers made square with the effigies of men cut in stone upon the tops of them as though they were watching and they were called garret which had square holes over the walls to through sons down  when these walls were finished is not exactly found gray gray   seems to think they were finished some little time before the reign of henry the  th  but this i imagine is a date too late for the finishing of them for henry the  th in the  th year of his reign aug    granted at the castle of porttefract that all fines redemptions amerciaments issues forfeitures and profits as well of pleas as that of justices of the peace etc be received by the mayor and burgesses of this town and their officers for supporting amending and repairing the walls bridges and gates of the town the walls then in this reign must have been completed forasmuch as they then probably wanted repairs  but further had gray remembered his own story abovementioned of the  00 valiant men that issued out at the whitefryergate and put the scottish army to flight he would surely have concluded that the walls were finished before that accident which happened in the reign of edward the  d certainly the scottish army which is said to have been a great one would not have lodged without the town if they could have lodged in it and what should hinder their lodging in it but the walls of the town well guarded i conclude therefore that the walls of the town at the latest were completed in the reign of king edward the  d before the year      for it was in this year that this transaction happened  after they were finished it gray    was famous for being a bullwark against the scots all the power of scotland could never win it but of late viz in the time of the civil wars being assisted by the english it was stormed and our churches and houses defaced and the ornaments of both taken away  it is now going fast into ruins several of the turrets and some of the round towers being fallen but the towers which stand together with some little parts of the wall adjoining to them are kept in good repair by their respective companies  the circumference of this wall from the closegate to the same is two miles and     yards  chap iv westgate this street has it is name from it is being on the west part of the town  from the gate eastward is a little street called rattenrawe at the end of which is a narrow passage turning up to the north which leads to the monastery of the blackfriars  sect i of the blackfriars the dominicans commonly called blackfriars preachingfryers and jacobine friars came over into england in the year of our lord fuller c hist      or as others say      and had their first residence in oxford they were a prior and    brethren their priors name was gilbert de fraxineto the name of the order was taken from st dominick born at cologona in spain of this order were no sewer than fourscore famous english writers  de reb novocast this monastery was founded by sir peter scott who was the first mayor of newcastle anno      and sir nicholas scott his son who was one of the   bailiffs of the town           and capital bailiff      but the site of it was given by   sisters whose names have long since been ingratefully buried in oblivion  when was the particular time of it is building i have met with no account but it is not difficult to give a probable guess the order itself of the dominicans or blackfryes came into england as is mentioned above in the year      consequently it must have been founded after that time and that it must have been founded some years before the year    0 is plain to a demonstration for in that year which was the eight of edward the first the blackfriars had license from the king to break a door through this new wall vid town wall into their garden which proves them a regular settled body at that time and therefore that their priory was built some years before that license  blackfriars gray  0 we are told that this monastery was in old time called the greyfryers which in my opinion is a thing highly improbable for the greyfryers or franciscans came not into england till about the year      and if as i have proved above the blackfriars were a settled body some years before the year    0 how is it possible to have been called of old time the greyfryers this is therefore a mistake and beside the dominicans came into england before the franciscans or greyfryers and therefore more probably were sooner in this place  it has been a very stately and beautiful building as appears by the present remains of it the area or grassplat is about    foot in length and as many in breadth on the east side of it was the chapel which is now the hall of the company of smiths in this town on the west side of it is a curious old well which served the monastery with water called our ladys well on the south may still be seen the ruins of a curious front on which side is the hall of the cordwainers in which i saw a pair of winding stairs which they told me before they were walled up led by a vault as far as the nunnery of st bartholomew on the north of it were their gardens a part of which was the wardens close before the building of that part of the townswall this appears by the charter granted to this monastery in the reign of edward the first about breaking out that narrowgate in the wall between westgate and newgate in which grant it is said that the wall went through the middle of their garden this monastery was dependant upon the priory of tinmouth  in the reign of edward the  d the brethren of this monastery had license granted them for the building of a drawbridge beyond the new ditch of the castle  who were the priors of this monastery what eminent men belonged to them or what things were transacted by them from their beginning till their dissolution were things undoubtedly preserved among themselves whilst they were a body but after their surrender were either destroyed or have not yet come to light  one of the priors of this monastery was one richard marshall i take this gentleman to have been the last prior of this monastery for in the   th of henry the  th a grant of a tenement nigh the whitecross signed by friar richard marshal dr and prior and friar david simpson and friar john sowrby was given to anthony godsave upon his paying to the said priory or monastery   s per ann this grant is now in the possession of mr thomas marshal of newcastle joyner who purchased this tenement and has lately rebuilt it he pays the same rent to the town of newcastle which the tenement paid to the monastery  about   years after the signing of this deed in january the  0th of this reign this monastery surrendered it consisted of a prior and twelve friars  the nature of surrendering was this according to bishop burnet who says burnets records p     at the surrendering of monasteries and abbeys etc there was generally a confession along with the surrender few of them are remaining the following one is one of the six the bishop had seen and is a copy from him page   0 coll rec  forasmuch as we the prior and friars of this house of carmelites in stamford commonly called the whitefryers in stamford in the county of lincoln do profoundly consider that the perfection of christian living does not consist in same ceremonies wearing of a white coat disguising of our selves after strange fashions dockying and becking wearing scapulars and hoods and other like papistical ceremonies wherein we have been most principally practiced and noseled in time past but the very true way to please god and to live a true christian man without all hypocrysie and feigned dissimulation is sincerely declared to us by our master christ his evangelists and apostles being minded hereafter to follow the same conforming ourselves to the will and pleasure of our supreamehead under god on earth the kings majesty and are not to follow henceforth the superstitious traditions of any forensecal potentate or power with mutual assent and consent do submit ourselves unto our said sovereign lord and with the like assent and consent do surrender etc signed by the prior and six friars  what became of the brethren of this our fryery after their surrender what they had allowed them annually for a maintenance or whether they had any thing allowed at all i have no where met with some account indeed i meet with afterward of the prior himself but none of the friars it is this which follows  collier eccl hist vol ii p  0  richard marshal prior of the blackfriars in newcastle about the year      went into scotland and preached at st andrews that the pater noster should be addressed to god and not to the saints some doctors of the university being disgusted at this assertion prevailed with one tofts a greyfryer to undertake to prove that the paternoster might be said to the saints whose ignorance in doing the same was so manifest that he became the common jest and quitted the town  after the surrender of the monastery on jan the  0th  0th of henry the  th the blackfriars was granted to the town of newcastle in consideration of    l   s   d the annual value of it was   l    s   d  the king says in the grant that he gives to the mayor and burgesses of newcastle the whole house and site lately a priory or a house of brethren called vulgarly the blackfriars in newcastle upon tyne the chapel houses edifices gardens etc the hall two chambers a chamber called the crosschamber and the two gardens with their appurtenances and the whole close within the westgate and another close near the site of the said priory on the north and a close containing   acres and a house in the same close without the walls of the said town and a house called the gate house situated near the street  it also appears from the grant that the king reserved to himself and successors the bells and lead that was upon the church belonging to this fryery and the other buildings of it the lead in the gutters together with the stones and iron of the church etc  the nine crafts of this town had their meeting houses or halls in it and still have except two of them the tailors and the cordwainers who have bestowed these upon some poor widows and got themselves others in other places these halls are of great service to this ancient building in preserving it from an entire ruin such is the hall of the smiths which was repaired by them in the year   0  john kellet thomas turner jonathan gibson roger haddock being wardens the hall of the dyers the hall of the bakers and brewers which was repaired ann      christopher rutter lionel dixon william dove john makepiece being then wardens these halls are on the east side of the fryery such also are those on the west side of it viz the hall of the this company has belonging to it an ancient manuscript beautifully wrote in old english rhyme it relates to our saviors sufferings i take it to be the play they were obliged by their ordinary to maintain on the feast of corpus christi sadlers which was repaired by them in the year      cuthbert berkley and matthew anderson wardens and the hall of the skinners and glovers which was repaired by them in the year      john emmerson robert barnes robert shutt philip smith being wardens such are those also on the south side of it viz the cordwainers hall which was turned into appartments for three widows in the year      john wheatley and george alder being wardens the hall of the butchers and the hall of the tanners was repaired in the year      thomas anderson william harrison thomas dixon william slaiter then wardens  by means of these halls there is still some visage of the fryery remaining which had otherwise been entirely in the dust it is a pity that those people who are permitted by the companies to reside in some of those rooms are not threatened into more cleanliness and that the companies themselves are not at the expense of repairing the area were these things done it would be a beautiful piece of antiquity and an entertainment to the curious from whencesoever they came  sect ii the vicarage in coming back by the narrow lane which led to the blackfriars we face a little street called fennel street which leads into westgate a street more retired than any other in this town there being no artificers or mechanics in this street nor any market it is chiefly inhabited by the clergy and gentry and indeed it seems all along to have been inhabited by such more than by others in some writings above  00 years old we meet with the names of some clergymen who lived in this street viz robertus de gonwerton thomas abelot etc not to mention those who belonged to the monasteries and hospitals and gray tells us that the men who lived in this street in his time had employment for both town and country he says also that in old time the earl of westmoreland had his house in this street  at present several of the houses in it are large and beautiful such are the houses of the lady clavering of utrick whitfield esquire thomas ord esquire mr abraham dixon etc in the upper part of it and of george gray esquire and others adjoining to him in the lower parts of it  on the north side of this street a little above st johns church is the vicarage house the dwelling of the vicars of newcastle it stands at least equally pleasant with the other houses in this place being situated in the middle of fields and gardens and more retired being at some distance from the street  who it was that built this house i have not been able to learn but it is not improbable that it was the town of newcastle who has been always famous for it is generosity to it is clergy as the vicarage itself in particular must always acknowledge it is at present more beautiful and convenient than it was wont to be having been repaired and enlarged in the year      by the rev and worthy dr ellison the then vicar  there is a hall belonging to this house built in a very grand and stately manner according to the hospitality of the times it was built in in particular it was the place where the vicars of newcastle were wont to entertain the inferior officers of churches the clarks sextons etc at the season of christmas if i am not very much mistaken there are many still living who remember this laudable custom  the garden belonging to this house though beneath some others in this street for art and curiosity and beauty of flowers yet in this it glories above all the others that the romanwall which was undoubtedly one of the great works of the roman empire is said to have passed through the middle of it  sect iii of st johns church this church is situated almost close to the vicarage it is dedicated to st john the baptist but who was the founder i never met with i am inclinable to believe it was founded by the townspeople notwithstanding a conjecture of an anonymous gentleman which is that robert rhodes was the builder of this church but this i think is impossible for the earliest he can be supposed to have lived is about the year    0 in the reign of henry the  th when john rhodes who was perhaps his father was mayor whereas it is certain this church was built at least an hundred years before for the grant of adam of durham to the the priest of st thomas the martyrs chantery in this church bears date the   th of march      in the reign of edward the  d consequently then the church must have been in being at this time and so could not have been built by robert rhodes nay in a charter dated      belonging to the rev mr smith of melsomby to whom i have been obliged for a sight of a great many writings i meet with these words venellum quo itur ad ecclesiam sancti joannis so that this church was still earlier in being viz in the   th of edward the  st however it is supposed that the steeple of this church was either built or at least beautified by him as also the southcross of the church for his coat of arms as also these words orate pro anima roberti rhodes are upon both of them which indeed makes it somewhat probable  this church as gray informs us was commended by an archprelate of this kingdom because it resembles much a churches were usually built in form of the cross to represent and commemorate the cross on which our lord died cross which indeed it does more than any other in this town  there were three chanteries consisted of salaries allowed to one or more priests to say daily masses for the souls of their deceased founders and their friends these were adjectives not able to stand of themselves and therefore united for their better support to some parochial collegiate or cathedral church full chapter hist p   0 chanteries belonging to this church one of which was the chantery of sciant presents etc quod ego adam de dunelm burgensis villae novi castri super tynam etc pro salute animae meae and pro animabus rogeri patris mei etc hac presenti carta mea confirmavi domino rogero de burneto capellano  singulis diebus ad altar beati thomae martyris in ecclesia parochiali sancti joannis de novocastro divina celebraturo totum illud messuagium etc et volo quod post decessum meum major and

praedictae ad hoc eloctis possint ad dictam cantariam quotrescunque ipsam vacatam contingat vtrum capellanum honestum discretum er honestum eligere and instituere etc st thomas the martyr which was founded about anno      in the reign of edward the  d for adam of durham burgess of this town according to the opinion of the times he lived in for the sake of his own soul and the souls of his father roger and agnes his mother etc gave an annual salary to such priests as have the addition of sir before their christian name were men not graduated in the university being in orders but not in degrees whilst others entitled masters had commenced in the arts note that generally founders of chanteries preferred priests not beneficed to those places as best at leisure constantly to attend the same fuller c hist p       sir roger de burneton the chantrypriest for celebrating divine service every day at the altar of st thomas the martyr in this church i take this chantry to have been situated on the north side of the said church extending as far as and adjoining close to the northcross of the church  when this priest of the chantry dyed another was to be chosen after the decease of the benefactor adam by the mayor and bailiffs of this town for the time being together with four of the most discreet and judicious men of the parish of st john elected for that purpose the mayor etc had also the power of turning out the priest of this chantry st johns church and putting another in his stead if he neglected his duty upon any canonical impediment beyond  0 days if he was taken with a fit of sickness he was obliged to provide another at his own expense to wait upon the altar they had a power also of turning him out and putting another in his stead if any scandalous crime was proved upon him  this writing was sealed by the seal of the benefactor and the common seal of the town of newcastle and witnessed by richard de emelden then mayor thomas de frismarisco richard de acton william de burneton gilbert de hankyn bailiffs of the town sir nicholas scot knight nicholas de carleol thomas de carleol peter graper etc  the yearly value of this chantry was   l   s which was raised out of certain tenements in the sandhill and westgate  another chantry belonging to this church was that of our lady founded by edward scott in the reign of edward the  d the yearly value of which was   l   s   d which arose out of tenements in the sandhill and westgate  the  d chantry was that of the holy trinity founded by john dalton william atkinshawe and andrew accliffe clerks the yearly value of which was   l    s   d which arose out of tenements in westgate side without westgate and a close without westgate  i have been told that the painted glass on one of the south windows of the quire of this church had on it the representation of the trinity it does indeed still resemble some such thing but if the knowledge of it was needful it might be queried whether it ever was any such representation  there is another thing at the top of this quire which though little known is yet of greater certainty and that is the funnel or wood box in the form of a spout which hangs from the top of this quire this was a conveyance for an artificial dove on the day of pentecost in the times of popery to represent the descent of the holy ghost that there were such things in churches though in none that i know of in this town but this is matter of fact for thus we are told that beehive of the romish church  geo gelding p  0    on whitsunday the papists begin to play a new interlude for then they sent down a dove out of an owls nest devised in the roof of the church but first they cast out rosin and gunpowder with wildfire to make the children afraid and that must needs be the holy ghost which comes with thunder and lightning  there was formerly an organ in this church this appears from the last will and testament of mr john wilkinson merchant of this town who was one of the ancestors of the present mr john wilkinson merchant to whom i am obliged for a sight of this will it bears date feb      0 and has these words i john wylkinson etc commend my soul unto

street is the hospital of st mary the virgin which contains two foundations an old one lib cart and a new one as they were called upon the founding of the latter the old one must have been founded not many years after the nunnery of st bartholomew which was founded by king henry the first for in a charter granted by king henry the second to the nuns of st bartholomew there is mention made of st marys in this town as may be seen in our account of these nuns but this conjecture will be more confirmed if it be considered that a charity was bestowed on this hospital by the lord walter de bolbeck as is mentioned below who gib camb p     as we are told in a charter dated the first year of king stephen conveyed some lands to the church of winchester if this was the same walter with him below and there appears nothing to the contrary then it is a strong reason that this hospital was founded in king henry the firsts reign the latter hospital and chapel were founded by one ego aselack de killynghowe fundavi hospitale sancta mariae virginis and capellam super terram meam in novo castello super tynam and ibi posui duos fratres regulares and unum capellanum ad serviandum deo and pauperibus reddidi meipsum deo and beatae mariae and fratribus ejudem hospitalis ibidem deo serventibus ad hospitandum pauperes and egenos clericos and peregrinos transeuntes pro salute animae patris mei matris meae and omnium pertinentium and pro salute animarum omnium hospitalis benefactorum lib cart   aselack of killinghow or killingworth as he himself acknowledges in his charter for that purpose i aselack of killinghowe have founded the hospital and chapel of st mary the virgin upon my own land for two brethren to be regulars and one chaplain to serve god and take care of the poor  we learn also from the same charter that the founder devoted himself to god and religion as he himself says according to the way of that age i render my self to god and the blessed virgin mary and the brethren of the same hospital there serving god to do works of hospitality to the poor the needy clergy and pilgrims and this he says he does for his own soul st marys hospital for the soul of his father and mother and his other relations together with the souls of all the benefactors of the hospital  some of the witnesses to this foundation charter were gilbert parson of eland richard parson of standfordham waldon parson of newburne eustachius parson of benton  the particular time when it was founded cannot be exactly learned there being no date at the charter but it is probable from a charter of king richard the first that it was founded some little while before he began to reign for when he confirms the sciatis me dedisle and concessisse domino and sanctae mariae and sanctimonialibus de novo castello pro salute animae meae and antecessorum meorum aselack burgeum meum de novo castello etc lib cart foundation of aselack he speaks of him as then living otherwise he would not call him his burgess of newcastle as he does in the charter  we meet also with an account of a third foundation belonging to this hospital which account is this the hospital of our lady called westgate spittle was founded by the inhabitants of newcastle for a master and chaplain to say divine service for   bid folks in the almshouse and to lodge poor and wayfaring people and to bury such as happened to die there and to distribute yearly nine chaldron of coals among poor people the yearly value of this was    l    s de rebus novocast  after the founding of this hospital and chapel there were several donations and charities bestowed upon it as had been before upon the old one some of the benefactors of both which and masters among a large number which might be mentioned are these following  benefactors mayors other witnesses masters robert de heddon clerk gave by the will and consent of his lord walter de bolbec a yearly sum on condition that the fraternity would pray for the souls of his lord and his ancestors and also for his own soul and his ancestors this was confirmed by the said lord to this hospital it is no small confirmation of the conjecture abovementioned the antiquity of this hospital from the donation of walter de bolbeck that there is no mention made here of the mayor of newcastle which is a proof that this donation was before the time of mayors and consequently that this hospital was founded at the time supposed reginold de benwell john morress and several others julian daughter of agnes blanch gave a charity to this hospital that her soul and the souls of her ancestors might be prayed for and that she might be entitled to a lodging in the said hospital when she came to town henry de carliol mayor about the year      in the reign of hen  d adam clerious thomas de carliol john flemmynge john sante bailiffs of the town robert lacy was now rector of the hospital martin corman gave a message to it for the sake of charity as he himself says in his grant and for the sake of his soul to this writing was annexed the seal of the town of newcastle henry of carliol being mayor that year which probably was the year      the  th year of his mayoralty for he was mayor  0 years together robert de mitford who was probably one of the northumberland family of that name was witness to this deed as was also adam de blakedene roger de quintingham nicholas scott      gilbert de tindale robert scott nicholas essot hugo de carliol      william de oggel walter de cowgate hugo de pandon magister      robert tunmbysiman and matilda his wise peter le graper   0  nicholas scott walter de cowgate richard emmelden hugo de pandon william herringe richard de immelden thomas de morpeth james magister       there were a great many more benefactors which would be tedious to mention here such as alan de wylam alan de gateside john porter thomas de gosforth radulphus de causi william son of robert de corbrigg gilbert de mora etc  besides the masters already mentioned i meet with one radulphus master but at what time is not said  simon was master       another simon was master in the year       robert lacy being master between them  john norrys was master about the year       james master       robert morden was master about the year       william de burnham   0   john colman       john fitzherry was master about

bewick was master       edward the third sent letters patents to this hospital to compensate for the losses it had sustained by the frequent incursions of the scots in these days and therefore gave them liberty to receive to the value of a hundred shillings tam in feodo suo quam in alieno  richard de bury bishop of durham granted a confirmation of all lands rents rights privileges etc belonging to st marys in westgate it was given at gateside jan        in the second year of his consecration  in the year      when william harding was mayor we have an account of the things belonging to this hospital some of which were as follows  imprimis tres calices deaurati etc  three chalices gilded with gold one entire vestment of bloody velvet woven about with goldon fringe with one cap one casule three albs for the principal festivals  also one cap of cloth of gold of red color wrought with golden images with one casule three albs  item one cap of a black color woven with dragons and birds in gold  item one single vestment wrought in with peacocks with a corporal belonging to the same  item another single vestment for the priest only of white bordered about with roses and with a corporal belonging to it  item another single vestment for the presbyter of a bloody color with a corporal belonging to the same  item another vestment for the presbyter of cloth of gold  item another vestment of cloth of gold interwoven with leopards and birds  item one hood or cap one casule one alb with a stole  item one single vestment for one priest in the hands of john fitzherry the present master  item one single vestment for the priest of st nicholas  item one hood  item a cover of bloody velvet for a sepulcher  item two casules the middle part of the casule of white color  also one hood of a red color for an ornament to the altar of st nicholas  also two linen clothes of a red color for the side ornament of the altar  also one frontale of satan of a bloody color woven with golden images for the altar  item one quadrigessimal vale of linen cloth of white color with a red cross below in the same  item one table set apart as an ornament for the linen of the altar  item one table gilded with the image of the blessed virgin mary  item two tables with the pax one of them gilded and beset with precious stones etc  in the   th of the reign of queen elizabeth the hospital of st mary in westgate and st mary magdalene without pilgrimstreetgate were granted to theophilus adams and james woodshaw under the yearly rent of   s   d  in the  th of king james the first a charter was granted for the hospital of st mary the virgin  the grammar school of this town which is now at westspittle was originally founded by thomas horsly who was mayor of newcastle in the year of our lord      by his last will he devised all his lands in newcastle after the death of him and his wife to erect a grammar school which was to be free for any one within and without the town in the manner directed by the said will  but in the year      it was removed from st nicholass churchyard from that house which is on the north side of the church over that place where the privy now is m s milbank where it had been from the time of it is institution to the westspittle the reason of which was this queen elizabeth ordained and granted that within this town of newcastle and the liberties thereof there should be erected and for ever there be one free grammar school which should be a free grammar school of queen elizabeth in newcastle and should consist of one master and scholars to be instructed in the same and that they the master and scholars of the same should for ever be one body corporate in law fact and name by the master and scholars of the free grammar school of queen elizabeth in newcastle upon tyne etc and by that name should have perpetual succession and should be in perpetual times to come able and capable in the law of having purchasing etc lands tenements etc to them and their successors in feesimple or for term of years so they exceed not the yearly value of  0 l and so they were not holden of the said queen her heirs and successors in chief nor by knight service and that the mayor and burgesses of newcastle and their successors or the greater part of them etc should have power to make an honest learned and discreet man to be the first and modern usher in the said school there to continue during the good pleasure of the said mayor and burgesses etc and that if the said master and usher should die or leave the said school etc then they might choose other men to be master and usher etc  it is very probable that the town of newcastle who always presented a master to this hospital as it did to st mary magdalens and st thomas the martyr upon tynebridge did at this time make the master of the grammar school master also of the hospital gray tells us that the first master of the head school was the rev master robert fowberry a learned and painful man to indoctrinate youth in greek and latin to be sure he was the first master after the removing of the school to the westspittle for undoubtedly there were masters before that as the school was so much earlier founded and accordingly in the manuscript abovementioned it is said that when mr burras gave over the the free school in st nicholas churchyard the mayor and    more sent for mr fowberry to hull and he came and first taught in the writingschool until the chapel of st marys hospital was made into a schoolhouse and the electionhouse was at the east end of it which had been the vestry but sir george selby who was then mayor set up his arms on the eastwindow made a traverse over it and sent to london for    chairs of mustinie leather and there is the election though the mayor lays down his staff in the old school  the masters of this hospital and school since robert fowberry m a      are  edward wigham clerk  francis gray clerk    0  walk suff clergy amor oxley had the free school

in london and rector of whickham in the county of durham near newcastle upon tyne who is also master of the chapel of st thomas the martyr upon the bridgeend and the hospital of st mary magdalen at the barrasbridge he became master in the year      the present master of the school is the rev mr edmund lodge who has under him two ushers the rev mr james fern and the rev mr george carr the three last mentioned gentlemen have each of them appartments where the hospital was which is a pleasing situation and in some of the best air of this town there is also in this place a writingschool erected by the town for the children of freemen the present master mr henry benson has also an appartment here  the town allows to the master  0 pounds per annum  to the first usher    pounds per annum  to the second usher    pounds  0 shillings per annum  the writing master is allowed    pounds per annum  this town allows to every one who goes from the grammar school to either university   pounds per annum  in our ladys chapel which still carrys it is name along with it having the effigies of the virgin mary with her son upon her knees at the east end of it is now the place of electing mayors aldermen sheriffs and the other officers of the town and is therefore now called the electionhouse but formerly the mayor was chosen in the writingschool this is constantly done the monday after michaelmas day which is therefore in this town called michaelmas monday  sect v earl of westmoreland s house next to st marys on the same side of this street is a very old building which was lately the dwelling house of sir robert shaftoe knight recorder of this town now the property and dwelling house of mr charles clark junr it has the magnificence and grandeur of antiquity in it is looks but what it has been formerly i could never find out gray tells us that in this street the earl of westmoreland had his house which indeed is true it was built by the baron of bywell and bolbeck about the  th of edward the third much about the same time he built a house within the bounds of the castle for the defense of it as may be seen in our account of the castle this house in westgate was called bolbeckhall but afterward upon it is founders being created earl which was in the reign of richard the second in the year      when ralph nevil lord of raby was created earl marshall it got the name of westmorelandplace in wesgate some have conjectured that sir robert shaftos house abovementioned was part of it and indeed it looks much liker a part of such a building e westmorland s house than any other thing remaining thereabouts i am sure much more so than the house which is supposed to have been it which i am told was the house opposite to the west end of dentonchair which the rev mr cowling lately lived in and which belongs to mr ord  however be this as it will whether it was this house now mentioned or whether westmorelandplace reached from this house to sir robert shaftos including it which some have conjectured yet this is certain that it must have been hereabouts for nevil tower is directly behind this piece of ground we are speaking of which is a sure token this must be the very place because whoever in the town built a tower at their own expense it was generally nigh them for their own security thus the whitefryers the brethren of st marys hospital the brethren of st austin etc built their towers over against their monasteries for their own safeguard and security but what i think puts it out of dispute that sir robert shaftos house was no part of it is that in the eleventh of queen elizabeth upon the attainder of charles earl of westmoreland this house where mr cowling lived was in charge which the other never was before the auditors and in the third of charles the first was sold to the citizens of london  lib de rebus novocast it was afterward in the tenure of james bertram and after that in the tenure of robert bertram  opposite to this house is a chair or lane called dentonchair which leads into the groatmarket middlestreet etc  this street is continued till you come to the street leading westward to the postern and eastward to the backraw from thence the street changes it is name and is called tuthill till you come to the tuthill stairs which lead into the close  sect vi bailiff gate on the east side of this street is a street facing the west side of the castle called bailiff gate which is said to have got it is name from the coming of the fellons of the county of northumberland along that street attended by the county bailiffs they came as is said to the westgate then down an old way close by the outside of the townwall and so in at the whitefryer gate from whence they went along bailiff gate and so were conveyed in at the posterngate on the west side of the castle opposite to this street of bailiff gate this is only traditional and has been therefore denied by the town of newcastle greys account is that at this gate the prisoners were brought in who were taken in times of hostility with scotland and carried from thence privately into the castle where the goal for the county is now  the same author also tells us that this street of bailiff gate formerly belonged to the castle and county of northumberland but i imagine had this been true the king would long ago have had his right the town of newcastle indeed has sometimes been made uneasy about that bailiffgate but still had it surer fixed to her as her undoubted property  in the year      the year after the king was beheaded there was a survey taken of bailiff gate etc  in the year following april   th    0 an order was sent down for annulling and vacating the survey made etc which was as follows    th april    0 at the committee of parliament in removing obstructions in the sale of the honors etc of the late king queen and prince whereas the mayor burgesses and other the inhabitants of the town of newcastle upon tyne did prefer their petition unto this committee complaining that certain persons employed for the common wealth have returned a survey to their trustees for sale of the late kings lands of and concerning diverse lands tenements and hereditaments within the said town of newcastle and precincts thereof to the value of  000 l   s   d per annum for which they have paid only a fee farm rent to the crown and in which the petitioners declare they had an indoubted inheritance further complaining that the premises in question were not in the possession of the crown anno      neither was there returned any special matter in the survey whereby to entitle the late king to the same the petitioners being the undoubted proprietors and owners of the things in question and whereas upon reading of the said petition and the certificate of the trustees and survey made in pursuance of an order of this committee grounded upon the said petition and the hearing of this cause this day before the committee concerning the premises in question in the presence of council for the common wealth as also the council in behalf of the said town the council in behalf of the common wealth did acknowledge that the said survey was returned without any just grounds and forasmuch as the council for the said town of newcastle were ready to produce their charters and evidences whereby to make it evidently appear that the inheritance of the premises in question have been for  00 years and upwards in the possession of the petitioners and their predecessors it is therefore this day ordered by the committee that the original survey returned of diverse messuages lands and tenements and hereditaments within the town of newcastle upon tyne and precincts thereof held by the said town now remaining with the trustees surveyor and register for sale of the said lands be annulled and void and is hereby vacated and that no further sale or other proceedings he had or made thereupon and that an entrance of this order be made upon the said survey and a memorandum be made thereupon that the said survey is vacated to the intent that the mayor burgesses and other inhabitants of the said town of newcastle may not for the future be questioned or molested concerning the premises mentioned in the said survey and the transcript of this order be likewise entered with the said trustees and contracters for sales of the said lands  james chaloner nath rich john garland tho lister jo jones   at the east end of this street upon the right hand is a way to the long stairs which lead into the close and on the left you

same side of the street where are the houses of george gray esquire mr anderson etc was the house of the carmelites or white friars  the carmelites are so named from mount carmel in syria they were first brought into england by ralph freeborne and by him placed near alnwick at a place called holm in a wilderness which was in his opinion likest to mount carmel in syria the place they came from the first provincial of this order was ralph freeborne himself who began his rule in the year    0 and ruled    years he lies buried at alnwick fullers hist of abbeys   speed this monastery was founded by king edward the first and dedicated to st mary i have met with little else relating to them except that they were a prior seven friars and two novices and that they surrendered jan  0th

constable calgarth in villa novicastri super tinam and quae contigua erat clauso and placeae dictorum fratrum in eadem villa  this place called calgarth which the abovementioned king gave to the brethren of the penance of jesus christ otherwise called brethren of the sack was supposed by sir john fenwick to be in the close of the whitefryers late in the holding of sir ralph delaval then called by the name of domus fratrum de penetentia i christi p    de reb nov   from the whitefryery this street leads to the tuthill stairs which is a passage into the street called the close  chap v newgatestreet of the upper and higher parts of this street toward the north the old part of newgate together with that part of the wall leading as far as evertower being visibly older than the other towers and the rest of the wall is a sure sign that when the walls were began this part of the town was then inhabited  it is probable that hereabouts was the ancient monkchester where the monks and religious men inhabited this appears from a place in this street viz that row of houses which stands almost in the middle of the street called to this day the hucksters booths for the people who dwelt in these houses were hucksters and supplied the religious houses with provisions there is a tradition still among the inhabitants of this part of the town that in old times there were many markets between the newgate and the whitecross nay some of them according to the tradition they have received will point out the very ground where such and such markets were  now this i think is a sufficient proof that these upper parts of the town were first inhabited by the monks the lower parts as far as the castle yard were the habitations of the towns people the castellum or fortification having been thereabouts from the beginning of hadrians wall as we are informed by a mr horsely of morpeth who died a few months ago a little before the publishing of his romana britannia the book referred to  this gentleman was of he was of the public grammar school of this town and afterward studied in one of the scotch colleges he was master of arts there and fellow of the royal society he is supposed to have been equally knowing with any in his time in the british roman antiquities romans britt       late ingenious author he says there must have been a station in this town for these reasons if we consider the importance of this place it is distance from the first station at the end of the wall and the turns the wall makes especially at the east side of the town in order to it is passing through the heart of it we can scarce question but there has been a station here and it is old name of monkchester seems to put it out of doubt the former part of the name is taken from the settlement of the monks in this place and the latter part from the word castra which is a pretty sure mark of a station besides the name newcastle given first to the castle it self and then to the town has been thought to imply as in other instances that there was an old vid chap of the castle castle or fort there before and near the place where the new one was erected and as this newcastle was built by robert son of william the conqueror the old castle must have been undoubtedly roman and some years ago a coin of vespasian was found near the castle as i was told by the person himfelf that found it  the same learned author goes on thus the next thing is to determine the boundaries and situation of this station which i persuade my self may be done i hinted before that there was a traditionary account of the walls passing through st georges porch near the north west corner of st nicholas church but it is certain that the line of the wall lies a little to the north of this end of the church and i think has not touched this porch though it comes near it and therefore i conjecture that the wall which has passed through this porch must have been the east rampart of the station for the supposition will reconcile these seemingly differing accounts and if a line be erected perpendicular to that of severiuss wall so as to pass through that porch and be continued along the brow of the hill at the head of the side till it meet the line of hadrians vallum near the east end of balygate and not far from the castle this line seems to answer so well in respects that i cannot much doubt it is having been the eastern limits of the ancient station for this brings the station near to the castle which probably has been built a little more to the south east in order to bring it nearer to the top of a steep hill and fixing the eastern boundary of the station here leaves a plain and level area for the station it self and without it a descent toward the south and the river for the town to stand upon which might extend it self to the bridge supposing the ancient bridge to be near the same place where the present one stands from which bridge the ancient town and station might probably take the name of ponsaelii this eastern boundary of the station must at that time have been nearer the river than it is now now since it is certain that the river formerly flowed farther up toward this part of the town the position of the eastern rampart of the station being thus determined the other boundaries may be also defined for the distance here between the lines of the walls seems to be about six chains and it is not much to be questioned but the two walls here as in other cases they frequently did have fallen in with the northern and southern ramparts of the station so that these six chains have been the breadth of the station and if we suppose the station to have been of a middle size we must make it a square and allow six chains for the length of it if at this distance another line be drawn equal and parallel to the former and between the lines of the wall it will be the western boundary of the station as the two respective parts of the two walls make the northern and southern limits and upon this supposition a line drawn from the foot of the fleshmarket to bailygate near the east end of it will be the eastern limits of the ancient station that part of the vallum which reaches from bailygate to mr ords house will be the southern limit and a line drawn from hence to that part of the line of severuss wall which is about thirty yards east from the end of rosemarylane must be the western boundary and the part of severuss wall included between this and the foot of the fleshmarket remains for the line of the northern rampart  sect i of st andrews church nigh to newgate on the west side of the street is st andrews church this is questionless the oldest church of this town not only from it is situation which is that part where was principally the ancient monkchester st andrews church but also from the model and fashion of it is building it appearing in these things older than the others  de reb novocast it is supposed to have been built by one of the kings of scotland david king of scots is mentioned in particular as it is founder but for what reason i know not indeed that david who died in the year      was a great benefactor to churches and religious houses and he is said in particular to have founded in this town collier eccles two religious houses but there is not a word of his being the founder of st andrews which in all probability would as soon have been taken notice of and handed down to posterity had it been true as the building of two religious houses but besides if st andrews be the oldest church in this town and this i think ought to be allowed for the reasons already given as also from the constant tradition of it is being so then it is undoubtedly older than st nicholass and if so it must have been built before the time of henry the first for st nicholass was built in that reign at latest and therefore it will follow that this church of st andrews was built before david king of scots was born  i am therefore rather inclinable to believe that it was founded by the towns people and the religious houses which at that time of day were chiefly in those higher parts of the town  there were three chanteries belonging to this church one of which was dedicated to our lady which was of the yearly value of   l    s  0 d no deed of foundation is showed but however it must at least have been founded in the reign of edward the first for in the latter end of that reign in a charter which one roger amyas granted to one stephen  it is ordered that he shall have such a particular booth for the term of  0 years provided he pay so much to the tyne bridge and to the altar of st mary in the church of st andrews in newcastle upon tyne  it had a house of seven shillings per annum belonging to it it abutted on the north next to the newgate and on the east on the high street on the west on st andrews churchyard and on the south on a tenement which in the nineteenth year of the reign of queen elizabeth belonged to robert hallyman  there belonged also to this chantery a house and a rig lying in the croft value   s   d  another was the chantery of the trinity which was of the yearly value of   l   s  0 d there is no deed of foundation to be seen of it but however to give some account of it is founder it may not be amiss to copy what i writ a few years ago on parchment and presented to the church of st andrews  to the rev mr john ellison minister and to the churchwardens of st andrews in newcastle upon tyne mr christopher rutter mr fenwick lambert mr thomas shevil mr percival bell  gentlemen i had the curiosity lately to search among the old writings in your vestry for that famous indulgence which is said to have been vid gray p    granted to your church by the pope for nine thousand years to come but found no such thing  there is however another indulgence which discovers a piece of antiquity relating to your church which i chused to acquaint you with in this manner that the ancient name of a part of your church now worn out of the memories of our townsmen and almost entirely lost might again be brought to light  this indulgence was granted in the reign of king richard the second in the year      an age in which indulgencies were common and when they were of particular service toward the building or repairing of churches for at that time of day when the building or repairing or adorning of a church was requisite an indulgence was granted for such a term of years or days to all such as would be assisting in the things aforesaid by which means many churches have been built repaired and beautified and accordingly this indulgence of yours was granted partly for the same end that the church of st andrews might be kept in sufficient repair for it promises an indulgence or pardon for qui ad reparationem seu ornamentum sive emendationem ecclesiae sancti andreae villae novocastri super tynam lin  0 indul  quadraginta dies indulgentiae concedimus  0 days to every one who shall contribute toward the repairing or beautifying of the church of st andrews in newcastle upon tyne and then follows the antiquity designed  that whoever ac capellae sanctae trinitatis in part aquilonari ejusdem ecclesiae aurum argentum etc lin  0 indulg offers or sends or causes to be sent to the chapel of the holy trinity in the northern part of the same church either gold silver vestments books chalices or any other ornaments which are wanting to the aforesaid chapel or altar or image of the holy trinity which is in the same chapel  or who shall fall down upon their knees before the image of the holy trinity aforesaid and pray for the health of sir adam de athol knt as long as he lives and for his soul after his decease and for the soul of the lady mary his wife whose body lies buried in the same chapel of the holy trinity shall as often as they perform those things or any of the things beforementioned have the benefit of a forty days indulgence  now from this it is observable that that waste place in the northern isle which opens into the quire must be the chapel here spoken of for there lies the body of sir adams wife which is said in the indulgence to be buried in the et pro anima dominae mariae sponsae suae cujus corpus in eadem capella sanctae trinitatis qutescit lin   indulg chapel of the holy trinity as also the body of sir adam himself the building itself is after the manner of chapels which were added to parish churches and it is still observable that at the top of the north window in the chapel there seems to be a picture of the holy trinity represented according to the superstition of these times by the face of an old man our savior upon the cross and the figure of a dove it having been always customary in these times not only to have the image of the saint set up to whom the church was dedicated but also to adorn the windows with it  i am of opinion that sir adam de athol himself was the founder of this chapel and my reasons for it are these   st it was customary formerly for people of better figure to build a small chapel at a convenient part of their parish church that they might have a convenient place to worship god in or that it might be a burial place for them and their families now it is evident that this chapel of the holy trinity is such a one for if you suppose the chapel away the church itself will appear exactly uniform which shows the chapel has been added to the church and as sir adam and his lady are buried in it is pretty clear that they were the founders it may also be presumed that he built it because it seems to have been built when sir adam lived for it is said in the indulgence to want books chalices vestments etc which implies it at that time to have been a new chapel and besides indulgences were granted toward the adorning of churches or chapels immediately after they were built this chapel was therefore built a little before the granting of this indulgence which was when sir adam was living and as his wife was then dead and buried in this chapel so she seems to have been the first that was buried in it and consequently her husband must have built it  but my last reason i think makes it amount to a demonstration it may be observed in all indulgences of this kind that it was not only required of the people to offer church ornaments but also to put up prayers for the founder thus for instance in an indulgence granted in the reign of king henry the eighth for the repairing and maintaining of the church and convent at kirby belers in the county of leicester it was not only required that money should be given but that they should also say a stavely chapter hist pa  00 pater noster with an ave for the souls of sir roger beler and alyce his wife founder and foundress  now from hence it is plain that sir adam and his lady must have been the founder and foundress of this chapel because they alone are mentioned in this indulgence and prayers were to be put up for them as they were for sir roger and his lady just now mentioned  thus i think i have found out the ancient name of your chapel and who was the founder it it may perhaps be somewhat satisfactory to those who are curious in those things may retrieve the ancient name of your chapel and establish the deserved remembrance of it is founder but be this as it will as i have only these things in view in making these observations so i hope you will be so good as to accept of them and allow them a place among the parchments of your church  i am gentlemen your most humble servant henry bourne silverstreet oct          the indulgence on which these observations are founded are granted by oswald the bishop of candida casa which is in gallaway in scotland it is dated at york      the   th year of his consecration  the  d chantery belonging to this church was dedicated to st thomas this i learn from an account i have met with of a house in this street which is said to have belonged to the chantery of st thomas in the church of st andrews  it bounderd on the west by st andrews church end and on the north by a house which in the reign of q elizabeth was in the possession of richard atkinson and on the east by the high street and on the south against the churchstyle it was valued at ten shillings per annum  that there was such a chantery in st andrews notwithstanding the two former are supposed to be all belonging to this church is further evident because i meet also with an account which says that the chantery of st thomas in st andrews had an orchard belonging to it which paid a yearly rent of three shillings and four pence to it but where it stood is not mentioned it was occupied by sir robert brandlin  that there were lands belonging to the chantery of st mary in this church which were situated in this street is certain but where to fix them at this time of day is pretty difficult but wherever they were situated there was an house situated near them which paid to the priory of hexham six shillings per annum  this is mentioned when rowland was prior in the year    0 in the reign of henry the  th de reb novocast   i meet with no account of the lands belonging to the chantery of the trinity except that of an house situated in a place called le cowgarth in this newgatestreet which paid one shilling per annum to this chantery and a tenement in westgate which paid   s   d  the altar of this church is very pretty and decent it was beautified a few years ago at the charge of the parish  there is at the west end of this church a beautiful gallery which was built in the year      at the charge of the parish in the year      the old porch was taken down and the present one built mr christopher rutter mr fenwick lambert churchwardens mr

belaysys to universitycollege in oxford the site of it is thus described situatum est infra praedictam villam juxta novam portam ejusdem villae in quo quidem tenement thomas gray lidster modo inhabitat viz inter tenementum roberti daunt ex part boreali and vicum ducentem ad fratres minores ab ecclesia sancti andreae ex part australi but the same writing goes further ac tria tenementa and duo tofta inde in simul situantur in eodem vico ducente a dicta ecclesia sancti andreae usque fratres praedictos etc  opposite to st andrews church is a lane which leads to pilgrimstreet gate called the highfryerchare because of a friar which was in it and because it is higher up in the town than the other friar chare  in coming down this street southward from the church of st andrews on the right hand is an ancient street called darncrook in which street were some wastes and house belonging to the nuns of st bartholomew as there were in almost every street in the town opposite to this place on the east side of this street of newgate is a little running water which goes into lorkburne this little bourn is taken notice of in the account of the ward belonging to fickettower and is called there a bourn beside lamplace that runs toward lorkburne to this bourn it is that the prisoners belonging to newgate have liberty to walk during the time they are not confined to the goal  from thence going still southward the street changes it is name from newgate to huxters booths for thereabouts it was that the huxters lived as has been observed above who supplied the religioushouses and the other people of this part of the town with provisions a part of these houses are still to be seen they stand by themselves almost in the middle of the street nigh the whitecross gray says that this part of the town was in his time called the huxtersbooths that is as i understand him from the bourn abovementioned to those houses  opposite to the booths was a great gate that led into the blackfriars it was situated between the house of william wilkinson smith and the house of elizabeth bell widow the place now is the entrance of a garden belonging to mr nicholas baily of newcastle this i think is evident from a grant of a tenement from the blackfriars now in the hands of mr tho marshall of this town wherein in describing the situation of the tenement are these words sicut jacet in villa antedicta prope crucem vulgariter vocatam whyttcross inter magnam portam praedictorum fratrum e regione praedictae crucis ex part boreali etc the tenement described is the house lately rebuilt by mr marshall aforesaid since this conjecture from the writing abovementioned i have met with the manuscript of mr milbank which very much corroborates it the words are these the gateway to this house was from the whitecross and was called when our author lived winds hole the way was a narrow lane to the fryery which in his time was joining to mr brandlings ground whereupon there was and still is a mill  the business and trade of this upper part of the street is chiefly that of the tanners  whitecross from the huxters booths to almost the nungate the street changes it is name again for the name of the whitecross because of a cross which stood there to which from the huxsters booths was the ancient market of this town as there is at this day at the calecross this cross was pulled down that very night after sir george selby dyed and king james of sacred memory march    milbank m s   on the place where the cross stood was a cistern for receiving of that water which goes by the name of the newwater this was lately pulled down and there is now in the place where the cross was a pillar of stonework the street hereabouts is wide and spacious and having in it several good buildings such are the houses of william carr esquire thomas clennell esquire etc there are four fairs kept in this street in the year one at lammas for horses and another at st lukesmass for horses the other two are for blackcattle the one on all souls day and the other at martinmas  near the cross is a lane called the lowfryerchare it got the name of fryerchare from it is being situated near the blackfriars and of the lowfryerchare because it is not so high up the town as the other fryerchare  it was also called formerly shodfryerchare because the blackfriars were also called shodfryers  sect iii nunngate from the whitecross southward the street leads to the nungate which gives name to a small part of the street thereabouts  this gate was not the greatgate of the nunnery but a back passage to it for nunnery was situated lower down as may still be seen by the ruins of some old walls in their garden probably it was situated about the place where mr hebdon a few years ago built a large house which is built upon the same ground where the old stone house stood inhabited by mr green which seemed to have been built out of the ruins of this nunnery here it was that king speed hist

that side of the street from the nuns to newgate belonged to these nuns for their garden reaches to highfryerchare this indeed is highly propable for the nine tofts or crofts confirmed to them in this charter seem to be a good proof of the truth of it  in the garden which belonged to them called still the nuns garden is a low square vale at the south west corner of which tradition says there is a vault which leads to the blackfriars mr richmond the present steward of mr blackett told me he had seen the entrance into it but that now it was filled up with earth  de rebus novocast stella an ancient village situated on the south of the river tyne belonged to the nuns of this hospital  on september the   th  d of charles the second after the death of sir nicholas tempest of stella of the county of durham knight and baronet it was found that he dyed possessed of the manor of stella in the parish of ryton in the county of durham which had been part of the lands of the house or monastery of st bartholomew in newcastle upon tyne the following writing for which i am obliged to the worthy dr hunter of durham and from which i had this confirmation is as follows    0 die september anno  0

in gateside commonly called gatesidehouse was according to some a sort of infirmary for the nuns of this hospital  dr smith in his ecclesiastical history of bid ubi nulla remanent antiqui monasterii

inveneris smith in not bed lib   c      says that in gateside there are no footsteps remaining of the ancient monastery of uttanus but of a more modern one we see a most beautiful chapel which is not as yet in ruins there is a tradition that this was a cell of the nuns of newcastle though we cannot readily quote any authority for it  the tradition mentioned by these gentlemen appears somewhat probable for in the charter beforemetioned the nuns of st bartholomew received two shillings annually from this cell  it is also not improbable but st marys hospital in westgate was also a cell to this nunnery it appearing plainly from the charter above that st marys was dependant on it  and it is said in leland that the hospital of st mary in newcastle upon tyne was given to the use of these nuns lel vol   p      it appears also from the charter just abovementioned that among the other things confirmed to this hospital the church of st bartholomew was one i may be asked therefore where this church was situated in answer to this i dare venture to say that there never was any such church in this town i mean a parish church and therefore it must have been the church or chapel belonging to this hospital and consequently must have been seated where the hospital was and this appears to be the rather true because we have no other mention made of their chapel and because when it is mentioned in the charter it is said to be given them that they may serve god in it  in the year      thomas hatfield bishop of durham confirmed to the nuns of this house the abbess they had elected

the property of walter blackett esquire and is a very delightful meadow  sect iv scotch inn opposite to this nunnery on the west side of the street is an ancient building with a large gate which has formerly been a piece of stately workmanship de rebus novocast this sir robert shaftoe recorder of this town was of opinion was the house of the earls of northumberland and was called the earls inn gray says it was called the scotch inn because it was there that the kings nobility and lards of scotland lodged in time of truce or league with england  this street from the scotch inn or thereabouts takes the name of the bigg and oatmarket because in the middle of it is kept a market of bigg and oats every tuesday and saturday here the street is broader than almost any street in the whole town and adorned with good houses at the end of it southward is a very great market for poultry which gives the name of the pullenmarket to this part of the street  chap vi of the division of this street having now got as far as the end of the broad part of this street we have the breadth of it divided into three streets the first street or that on the right hand is called the mealmarket the oatmealmarket or groatmarket because of the oatmeal which is sold there every day of the week but more especially on the saturdays what name it had formerly or whether it ever had any other i cannot say but this is certain that it has retained it is present name above two hundred years  at the upperend of this street or the northend of it is the post house of this town which is adorned with a pretty area of a quadrangular figure together with a good garden it belongs to mr james bell the present postmaster  as you descend from this end of the street you turn the corner of this house upon the right hand into a lane called the puddingchare or as i have seen it in some ancient writings buddingchare which leads into westgate there were three houses in this lane which paid an annual rent to the chantry of the holy trinity in st johns church one paid  0 d per ann another   d and the third   d the lane called rosemarylane which turns upon the right hand as you go down this chare into westgate was formerly called st johns chare because it led from the puddingchare to st johns church  in this lane there is a waste which belonged to the nuns of st bartholomew boundering on the west on the common gutter and on the north on the chantery lands  this waste is the ground where are now the gardens of mr james bell postmaster and the old houses on the north of these gardens now the property of mr ralph trotter are the chantery lands here mentioned  over against the southend of this lane which so leads to st johns church is an ancient almshouse in which live seven poor people who have a small allowance at christmas from the town  having past the east end of the puddingchare we go southward which leads into the body of the mealmarket aforesaid  there is little in this street worth taking notice of the houses generally are very ancient and mean the few good ones are one which was built the last year by mr prior of this town cooper an ancient inhabitant in this street and another the house below it which belongs to mr william harrison dyer which was formerly the dwelling house of timothy robson esquire alderman of this town and sometime mayor and some few others  in the reign of queen elizabeth a house in this street belonging to one william penrith whose site is now lost paid an annual rent to the chantery of our lady in the parish church of longbenton  romans britann p     the late mr horsely tells us of another house in this street in the laying of the foundation of which about    or    years since the masons struck upon the roman wall at each of the side walls so that the building stands cross the roman wall but where the site of it is he does not say  toward the lower end of this street is a large open where is a market every saturday for wool below this again a lane leading into westgate called dentonchare  passing by the east end of this chare we come to the ancient ironmarket which was opposite to st nicholas church in that piece of ground leading to the side from the house of mr charles clark and from below the shop of the late mr john kellot smith  another street which the broad street of the bigmarket is divided into is the middlestreet so called because it stands in the middle of the streets in this part of the town for it has on the east side of it the fleshmarket and pilgrimstreet and on the west the oatmealmarket and westgate  this street bore anciently three names the upper part of it was called skinnergate the lower part of it spurriergate and sadlergate  it is a street as it was in greys time where all sorts of artificers have shops and houses  we come now to the  d street viz the fleshmarket at the upperend of which is the upperdeanbridge so called because of the two bridges which cross this dean or rivulet which runs into lorkburne this is that which is the higher or upper one  having passed by the west end of this bridge we go southward into the fleshmarket  gray tells us that when the goodmen of this town began to trade and venture beyond the seas they built many ships and procured a charter from the kings of england to carry fells beyond seas and to bring in foreign commodities the staple was then at antwerp in brabant called commune totius europae emporium the charter of the merchant adventurers was the first charter that was granted by any king to any town  after this grant this town flourished in trading built many fair houses in the fleshmarket then called clothmarket the merchants had their shops and warehouses there in the backparts of their houses the river of tyne flowed and ebbed where boats came up with commodities which trade of merchandises continued many years  in this street the mayors aldermen and richest men of the town lived  part of the present fleshmarket was called the clothmarket and part of it the fleshmarket and fishmarket an anonymous authority says that in pilgrimstreet was the market for fish that came up to the netherdeanbridge but this in my opinion is a mistake for in the ward belonging to mordentower part of it is over the fleshshambles from the north west church style of st nicholas unto the fishshambles consequently the fish that came up to the netherdeanbridge must have been sold in the fleshmarket not in pilgrimstreet the shops of this street are at present the shops of artificers and the houses either chiefly coffeehouses or taverns or alehouses  in some ancient writings belonging to that worthy gentleman the rev mr smith of melsonby i find that several houses in this street paid an annual rent to university college in oxford one of them in particular nigh the church yard paid   s in the year   0  and so did many houses in the other streets of this town to the same college several of these were the gift of the lady ann bellasys to this college an       the fleshmarket in this street which is held every saturday is a very great market not only as it supplies the town in a great measure but as it also furnishes the country for several miles round besides there are several thousands of people belonging to the coalworks such as staithmen waggoners pitmen wrights keelmen etc all which for the most part have their provisions from this market  the provision also for ships is got from this market and this indeed must be very considerable when there will be sometimes   or   hundred sail in at a time  there are   fairs kept in this market every year for   days together the one begins upon lammas day or the first of august which gray calls a remarkable time of the year but why he calls it so he gives no account this fair is in some measure of an ancient standing for we meet with some account of it in the reign of king john mentioned in a charter of another of our kings the words are these insuper cum dicti burgenses per chartam praefati joannis regis habeant in dicto burgo unam feriam singulis annis per duos dies duraturam viz in vigilia and in die sancti petri ad vincula etc  now from this it appears that king john granted to the town of newcastle lammas fair which he ordered should be held on the eve of st peter ad vincula and upon the day it self blount in verb i suppose gray calls it a remarkable time of the year as well because it is called lammas day as because it is called st peter advincula as it is lammas day it is a remarkable time of the year for it is called lambmas because lambs were not then fit to eat they were grown too big aliter from the sax iii asmaesse q d loafmas because on that day the english made an offering of bread made with new wheat on this day it was that tenants that held lands of the cathedral church of york which is dedicated to st peter ad vincula were bound by their tenure to bring a live lamb into the church at highmass on that day  it is also a remarkable time as it is st peter ad vincula and as it is called the gule of august from the latin gula a throat the reason is set down in durands rationale  lib   c    who says that one quirinus a tribune having a daughter that had a disease in her throat went to alexander then pope of rome the  th from st peter and desired of him to borrow or to see the chains that st peter was chained with under nero which being obtained the said daughter kissing the chains was cured of her desease and quirinus with his family baptized tunc dictus alexander papa hoc festum in calendis augusti celebrandum instituit and in honorem beati petri ecclesiam in urbe fabricavit ubi vincula ipsa reposuit and ad vincula nominavit and in calendis augusti dedicavit in qua festivitate populus illic ipsa vincula hodie osculatur so that this day being before called only the calends of august was upon this occasion termed indifferently either st peters day ad vincula from the instrument that wrought the miracle or the gule of august from that part of the virgin whereon the miracle was wrought blount in verb  after this fair granted by king john it was by a succeeding king ordered to begin at the same time and to continue    days when it was reduced to the time abovementioned i have not met with  the other fair held in this market is at st lukesmas it was granted to the town in the reign of henry the  th during the time of these fairs there is a court of pyepowder all the privileges and power that a court leet can have is granted to this court gray     toward the southend of this was a large cross with a lead cistern at the top of it to hold the water called the newwater which was pulled down about   years ago beyond this at the end of this street is the cordiners meeting house  chap vii of st nicholas church at the end of the fleshmarket on the south side of the cordiners meeting house just now mentioned stands the church of st nicholas it is a very grand and magnificent building being in length    yards two foot three quarters in breadth    yards two foot three quarters and of an height equal and proportionable who it was founded by i have no where met with but if a conjecture may be made it was perhaps founded by henry the first but be this as it will it is certain it is as old as his days for henricus rex angliae archiepiscopo ebor and episcopo

   it was this king that gave it to the church and canons of st marys of carlisle and also at the same time the church of newburn  in a book belonging to the vestry of st nicholas it is said to be founded in the year  0   but what authority this account depends upon i know not however it is somewhat probable  the ordering of the vicarage was not till some years after the king indeed in his charter makes a general provision of what is necessary for the minister of this church but does not say what that is this was done by hugh pudsey bishop of durham as thomas hatfield one of his successors gave it under his episcopal seal at auckland june  th    0 for having searched the register of hugh his predecessor he found that he with the consent of the prior and convent of carlisle ordered the vicarage of st nicholas in newcastle upon tyne on the day before the conversion of st paul or january   th      and gave the vicar for the time being a portion or maintenance viz all the fruits annual profits oblations obventions whatsoever of what kind or thing soever they were belonging to the church of st nicholas except the great tithes belonging to the same church  this account i

testimonium sigillum nostrum fecimus hiis apponi dat in manerio nostro de auckland sexto die mensis junii anno dom    0 and nostrae consecrationis quinto decimo  the steeple of this church is in height    yards one foot three quarters it is supposed as to it is model to be the most curious in the whole kingdom it is adorned with    pinacles and a large and beautiful lanthorn which stands upon two very bold arches of stone and at the top of the said lanthorn stands the tall spire by much the largest belonging to the steeple on the corners of the old tower upon which stands the said beautiful structure are four images one at each corner cut at length in stone it is said that been johnson the poet made the following lines upon it  my ex gray altitude high my body four square my foot in the grave my head in the air my eyes in my sides five tongues in my womb thirteen heads upon my body four images alone i can direct you where the wind does stay and i tune gods precepts twice a day i am seen where i am not i am heard where i is not tell me now what i am and see that you miss not it is said and indeed confessed that robert rhodes was more probably the builder of this steeple than any other person his name being at the bottom of the belsry  orate pro anima roberti rhodes but who this robert rhodes was is more uncertain gray tells us that robert de rhodes was the lord prior of tinmouth in henry the  th days and an anoymous authority seems to suggest that this robert rhodes was one of the bishop of durhams justices because in a register at durham there is mention made of robert rhodes ab anno      ad an      and agnes his wife  but neither of these seem to me to be the true one i am rather inclinable to believe that one robert rhodes esquire who lived in this town in the reign of henry the  th was the true person we meet with this gentlemans name in an inquisition that was taken at the castle of newcastle in the   th of henry the  th      for two of the gentlemen present were roger thornton the son of the famous benefactor of that name and robert rhodes and they were also first mentioned after the mayor  lib de reb    in the year      we meet again with the same person who together with the said roger thornton by an instrument bearing the same date conveyed some houses for the use of a chantery priest to pray for the soul of william johnson we have also a further account of this gentleman in the year   00 for an instrument bearing that date informs us that the mayor and inhabitants of newcastle gave a tenement to a priest to live in who was to pray for the soul of robert rhodes and agnes his wife at the altar of st john the baptist and john the evangelist in st nicholas church  now when it is considered that this robert rhodes i am speaking of was so great a man in this town that he lived in the same reign in which gray acknowledges the lantern to have been built namely in the reign of hen the  th and that he was so commemorated by the mayor and inhabitants after his decease i dare say it will appear much more probable that he was the builder than either of the others  there might indeed be and probably there was a robert rhodes prior of tinmouth in the reign of hen the  th but i never met with any benefactions of the priors of tinmouth to the town of newcastle they were on the contrary mortal enemies to this place and always jealous of it is increasing glory as to the other robert rhodes one of the bishops justices he was alive in the year      which was the   th of henry the  th and so comes too late to build a steeple in the reign of henry the  th i have been told by a worthy gentleman and one who is curious in these things that this robert rhodes so taken notice of by this town was escheator  there is a traditional story of this building i am now treating of which may not be improper to be here taken notice of in the time of the civil wars when the scots had besieged the town for several weeks and were still as far as at first from taking it the general sent a messenger to the mayor or of the town and demanded the keys and the delivering up of the town or he would immediately demolish the steeple of st nicholas the mayor and aldermen upon hearing this immediately ordered a certain number of the chiefest of the scottish prisoners to be carried up to the top of the old tower the place below the lantern and there confined after this they returned the general an answer to this purpose that they would upon no terms deliver up the town but would to the last moment defend it that the steeple of st nicholas was indeed a beautiful and magnificent piece of architecture and one of the great ornaments of their town but yet should be blown into attoms before ransomed at such a rate that however if it was to fall it should not fall alone that the same moment he destroyed the beautiful structure he should bath his hands in the blood of his countrymen who were placed there on purpose either to preserve it from ruin or to die along with it this message had the desired effect the men were there kept prisoners during the whole time of the siege and not so much as one gun fired against it  there were only five bells originally belonging to this church but of late years the number is increased to eight the great bell called the common bell was sent to colchester to be new cast in the year      it weighed      lb they are very large ones have a bold and noble sound and yet exceedingly sweet and harmonious the three latter bells were given to this church by the corporation  in the year      william ellison esquire mayor and robert sowersby esquire sheriff the steeple was repaired at the expense of the corporation  at the north door of this church it is observable that the large flagg which is the first step into the church is cut all along the surface with uneven lines in imitation of the waves of the sea this is a silent remembrancer of the saint the church is dedicated to for st nicholas the bishop of myra who lived in the time of constantine the great is so famous among some for his miracles and apparitions by sea that he has merited the title of the patron of the sailors  there were no fewer than   chanteries belonging to this church which are valued at    l   s   d per annum  the chantery of st john the baptist and st john the apostle was on the in ecclesia sancti nich de dicta villa novicastri ad altar boreale joannis baptistae and joannis apost and evangel lib cart p     northside of the church it is said to have been founded by robert rhodes and agnes his wife and licensed by king henry the  th if there be any truth in this it is that he was a third founder he allowed a priest   l   s  0 d per annum to pray for his soul and the soul of his wife and the town of newcastle as it is said above out of respect to his memory gave the priest a house to live in but it is a mistake that this chantery was not founded before for richard de emeldon who had been above    times mayor of newcastle was permitted by letters patents from king edward the  d to build upon a piece of vacant ground over against the chapel of st thomas the martyr that he might present it to three chaplains to procure their prayers for him whilst he was living and after he was dead and also for the souls of his wives and his father and mother etc every day at the altar in st nicholas which was dedicated to john the baptist and john the apostle and evangelist this gentleman died about the  th or  th of the reign now mentioned as is clearly gathered from the authority above and the letters in which this chantery is mentioned bear date the  th of this reign and therefore it is a mistake to suppose this chantery founded in the reign of henry the  th which was almost an hundred years after  the priests set apart to attend this altar were every day to pray for his soul and the others abovementioned and by an order from the then richard lord bishop of durham the chaplains for the time being were obliged on the anniversary day of his death every year for ever to celebrate his memory with a solemn tolling of the bells and devoutly singing by note in the evening of the anniversary and on the anniversary itself and solemnly to sing mass for the soul of richard himself and the souls abovementioned and the souls of all the faithful departed and after mass one of the chaplains was to distribute among an hundred and sixty poor people the sum of six shillings and eightpence and this annually for ever this together with several other things was ordered by richard bishop of durham in the  d year of his consecration anno      which was with all other things mentioned in the charter confirmed by edward the  d in the  0th year of his reign  thus then it appears that this chantery is of a much older date than the reign of henry the sixth but this is not all richard de emeldon was but a second founder of this chantery it boasts still an higher antiquity and is said to have been founded by laurence of durham who was prior of durham in the year      which by the way is a further proof of our conjecture of this churchs being founded by king henry the first or in that reign at latest    the chantery of st catherine was founded by william johnson and isabel his wife in the reign of edward the third it is yearly value was   l    s roger thornton the son of roger the great benefactor in a deed dated december the  0th      is made together with some others a trustee by a feoffment of roger booth the surviving feoffee of william johnson who gave the lands and tenements therein mentioned for the better support of a perpetual chaplain to attend the chantery of st catherine which is said to be ab alanodurham ab antiquo sundat  in the reign of king henry the  th one robert mitford was the chaplain of this chantery who succeeded peter angram a former chaplain    another chantery of st catherine was founded by nicholas and john elliker the deed of foundation is said to have been imbezeled by richard wallas late incumbent there the yearly value   l    s   d which arose out of certain tenements

  l    s   d    the chantery of our lady whose deed of foundation is said to have been imbezeled by thomas ireland late incumbent there but however we may give some guess at the time of it for lib cart p    there is mention made of it and of two shillings a year given to it in a charter which was signed by nicholas de carleol then capital bailiff of the town in the year      and in the year   0  peter graper then mayor of the town gave et cuidam capellano celebranti divina ad altar beatae mariae virginis in ecclesia beatae nicholai de novo castro duos solidos argenti etc lib cart two shillings a year to the chaplain that waited upon the altar of the blessed virgin mary in the church of st nicholas so that it must at latest have been founded in the reign of king edward the first that large porch on the south side of the church or the southcross of the church as it is called is the chantery of st marys the yearly value of it was   l    s    stephen whitgray and mary his wife founded the chantery of st margaret in the south side of the church of st nicholas in the reign of richard the second i take that square place called bewicks burialplace now the burialplace of utrick whitfield esquire near the porchdoor of this church to have been this chantery  they constituted john de etell chaplain of this chantery to pray for their souls and the souls of the faithful departed the value of this chantery was  0 marks yearly which was raised out of certain tenements viz out of one near the calecross and from a tenement which paid somewhat to the chantery of st eligie in the church of allhallows in this town and from another tenement near the calecross which lay near grundonchare and from another tenement over against st nicholas church and from another tenement in hackergate near the chapel of all saints and from a tenement near kirkchare from a tenement in pampedon from a tenement in broadchare from a garden near pampedonburne from a tenement in calegarth in broadchare etc  the chaplain of this chantery after the decease of the founder was to be chosen by the vicar of st nicholas the mayor and bailiffs of this town and four of the honest parishioners of st nicholas witnesses of this charter were laurentius de acton mayor of this town henry de carliol thomas de gryndon john de newbiggyng john de appreton bailiffs thomas de herington john de coket

repaired by robert rhodes the builder of the upper part of the steeple for his coat of arms and probably his wifes too is quartered on the basis of it  on the northisle answering to the nave or body of this church is a large gallery which is chiefly for the use of the boys of the grammar school at the east end of which an addition was made to it by the rev dr tomlinson for the use of his successor the lecturer of st nicholas and his own family  in the roodloft or the gallery which seperates the chancel from the nave of the church now called the organloft is a double organ  on the northside of this organ is a porch called saint georges porch which was built as gray informs us by one of the kings of this land it has undoubtedly been one of the ancient chanteries for several of them were situated thereabouts between the gallery and this porch as some others of them were in st marys porch or the south cross of the church it has under it a vault and there is on the north windows the head of the king the father of the lady which st george delivered from the dragon  on the east windows is still remaining some of the painted glass there is particularly the picture of saint laurence and some skinmarks and coats of arms it has been a beautiful little place it is ceiled at the top and has been surrounded with carved work in wood some of which still remains to speak the curious art and commendable expense of the days of old  the chancel of this church is a very noble and stately one the altar was in the year      very sumptuously and yet decently adorned at the  top is the word jehovah and under that in a glory a part of the name of lord which he himself proclaimed before moses the lord god merciful and gracious what is below that again see in the altar of allhallows  the plate for the altar  two flaggons three challices and covers three salvers a small spoon drainer  on the south side of the chancel is the vestry above which is the library the keeper of which is the rev mr stoddard assistant curate of this church  in this are several good books and some manuscripts but it is not at present any way comparable to what it will be hereafter either for variety or number of books of all kinds of learning the worthy and learned dr tomlinson being expected to leave at his death to this library his whole study which is perhaps considering the vast number of books their being so well chosen so neatly and curiously bound their great variety being of all manner of subjects treating of all arts and sciences a library outdone by few private gentlemen in the kingdom  gray  0 in this church are many sumptuous windows but that in the east surpasses all the rest in height largeness and beauty this author says that there were in this window the twelve apostles and the seven deeds of charity i suppose he means painted upon the glass he tells us also that this window was built by the beneficent roger thornton the elder and that there was this inscription on it orate pro anima rogeri de thornton and pro animabus filiorum and filiarum at present there is nothing remaining of these pictures but two heads which if we may judge of the rest by them will speak them to have been very tall and curiously done the inscription is entirely gone  an indulgence of  0 days was granted by twelve foreign bishops      and confirmed by thomas hatfield bishop of durham to all such having repented and confessed their sins as performed the following things viz if they came to this church to mass to prayers morning or evening or other divine offices on

moneys which were then extorted from the country to carry on the war of britany the vulgar conceiving him to be the cause of that task tumultuously murdered him at cockledge near threske eighteen miles north of york upon the day of st vitalis the martyr whereupon he was buried at beverley where he has a stately monument but much defaced this is shrine at present much more so being no where to be met with bull gray tells us that in this part of the church there was such a monument in his time that was made in memory of him in his own country he having a house in this town and parish and that part of the inscription upon it was orate pro anima hemici percy   northumbriae qui per rebbelium manus occabuit etc  the milbank manuscript says it was in the north corner of the church that it was a monument of wood on which was painted an old man our savior on his right hand and the virgin mary on his left there came a labil from her mouth but what it was this authority had forgot but that from our saviors was quaeso patri sac qued rog it mea matter  then followed some latin verses done in the rhiming way of the monks but they are so dark and obscure that little can be made of them the manuscript goes on when mr william selby was buried this monument was removed out of that corner and sir george selby did set his magnificent tomb there alter that it was placed against the wall next to sir georges tomb and so continued till mr lane hodshon got leave of vicar nailor to remove it and place his father where it is now i know not  gray tells us that the parson of the town is the bishop of carlisle who has his vicar or substitute how this bishop came to have this living in his gift i have showed in the beginning of our account of this church  upon this church depend the other

he succeeded in the vicarage of newcastle in the year    0 when the most learned dr jackson was elected president of corpus christi college in oxford his sufferings began very early in the troubles vide ann      as i find by a letter of his written to his grace the archbishop of canterbury and dated from york oct       0 wherein he sets forth what he then had suffered in the following manner i am for the present outed of all my spiritual promotions to the yearly value of  00 l and have most of my moveable goods seized upon by the rebels being forced upon some threatening speeches given out by them that they would deal more rigourously with me than others suddenly to desert all and to provide for the safety of my self wife and seven children by a speedy flight in the nightime how they would have dealt with me they have since made evident by their harsh dealing with two of my curates whom i left to officiate for me in my absence who have not only been interrupted in reading divine service but threatened to be pistold if they would not desist from the execution of their office and whereas i had lately purchased  0 pounds per annum in northumberland and hoped to have been supplied that way in these calamitous times till i might with safety return they have since i presented my petition to his majesty seized upon that also and commanded my servant to be accountable to them for it this is my case at this time afterward as might be expected it was far worse for as i am otherwise informed he was not only pulled out of this pulpit by two holy sisters but imprisoned at newcastle at holyisland and at norwich his family increased under his troubles if i mistake not to ten children for so many i find his wife bore him in all which were reduced to great streights and subsisted in good measure by charity i perceive by the letter abovementioned that he had been active as well as passive in the service of his majesty by both which means he had so far recommended himself to the favor and esteem of that prince that he had designed some reward for him which in all probability the rebellion prevented the king from bestowing nor did mr alvey live to receive it from his royal son on the restoration for his death happened in the year      and was hastened as it is thought by his sufferings he was a very honest good man and a true son of the church of england

and after her death to go to the use of this school for ever  netherdeanbridge directly opposite to the east window of st nicholas church is the netherdeanbridge which you descend into by some stairs that lead from the churchyard  it is called so because it goes over the dean or syke lower down the town than the other bridge for as the higherbridge has the name of the upperdeanbridge because it is higher in the town so this being lower in the town has the name of the netherdeanbridge it is a little narrow lane which leads into pilgrimstreet formerly when the merchants had their shops and warehouses in the fleshmarket the river ebbed and flowed above this bridge and the boats came under it with the wares and commodities of the merchants but it is chiefly famous because the roman wall went along it it came from the vicars garden through the body of st nicholas church then along this street and so on into pandon  as you descend the stairs aforementioned into this lane there is an almshouse on the left hand for two or three poor women but it has no allowance  chap viii of pilgrimstreet this street got it is name from the pilgrims who came from all parts of this kingdom to worship at our ladys chapel at gesmond or jesumunde or as it is called in some ancient writings jesumuth is it pleasant village on the northeast of newcastle distant from it about   miles it appertained to the barony of robert de gaugy as appears by a certificate given in the third of hen the  d of such manours as his barony did consist of for which he was obliged to the service of three knights fees mag brit vol   adamus de athol who lies buried in the chapel of the holy trinity in st andrews church lived in this village and is called dominus de jesmond the ordes family was also in possession of it  there are still to be seen the ruins of the chapel and hospital of our lady in this village the hospital is now a dwelling house but the chapel is changed into something worse being turned into a stable  i am told and it is very probable that this chapel and hospital are at present the property of mr robert andrew of gateshead   gesmond  there was an inn in this street which the pilgrims in their journey were wont to call at which occasioned their constant coming up this street and so it got it is name of pilgrimstreet as the inn did that of the pilgrims inn as you descend this street you have on the left hand a passage to the carliolcroft which is a large field formerly the property of the carliols now of john rogers esquire bounded on one side with the towns walls and on the other by the gardens on this side of pilgrimstreet  on that side of it next the townwall is a very agreeable walk generally frequented in a summers evening by the gentry of this part of the town the prospect of the gardens some of which are exceeding curious affording a good deal of pleasure  there is a passage from this field into the manourchare  in the year      sir in the   d   th and   th of edward the first robert de hilton of hilton in the county palatine of durham had summons to parliament amongst the barons of this realm and in the  th of edward the  d was in that expedition then made into scotland this robert married margaret one of the three coheitesses to marmaduke de thwenge and left issue two daughters his heirs viz isabel married to walter de penwardyn and maud to hotham  after this there is mention made of alexander de hilton who in the  th of edward the third served in the scottish wars with ralph lord nevil and had summons to parliament in the  th and  th of edward the third but no longer  this is in all probability the same alexander with him above mentioned  the present gentlemen john hilton esquire a regular descendant of this ancient family lives in the place of his ancestors which he has adorned and beautified beyond what was done in past ages in particular the chapel famous in this country for it is irishwood is so furnished with place and books and other necessaries that it merits the character of a very beautiful chapel this family is the ancientest in england that bears a coat of arms   alexander of hilton and matilda his wife the two patrons of the chapel of gesmonde presented to it one sir william of heighington to be chaplain who was accordingly instituted by thomas hatfield bishop of durham and after that inducted as was attested at auckland june the   th      but on the   th of the month following he gave it up declaring he had no right or title to it the copy of the original of this account i had

in praedicta capella vel ad eam habuit seu quovis modo habere poterit in futurum asserens se nullum habuisse unquam nec habere titulum in hac part  to this village it was that a great number of the people of newcastle headed by some of the aldermen and principal men of the town came to kill the prior of tinmouth in the first of the reign of king henry the eighth as may be seen in that year  in the  d of edw  th the town got a grant of the chapel of the blessed mary of jesmond and some messuages and lands in jesmond under an annual rent of   s   d payable out of some lands in old heaton and the chapel or chantery of st laurence with the messuages called st laurence and little st annes close and lands in byker then in the possession of henry winklive and lands in killingworth then in the possession of john humley an annual rent   s payable oat of the lands of the then christopher mitford in oldheaton  these were granted in consideration of     l    s   d  in the same year the mayor and burgesses granted the hospital of the blessed mary of jesmond with the lands and grounds belonging to it to sir john brandling his heirs and assigns for ever  the gentleman of this place at present is william coulson esquire who lately built a very pretty house and accommodated it with gardens  st mary s well in this village which is said to have had as many steps down to it as there are articles in the creed was lately enclosed by mr coulson for a bathingplace which was no sooner done than the water left it this occasioned strange whispers in the village and the adjacent place the well was always esteemed of more sanctity than common wells and therefore the failing of the water could be looked upon its nothing less than a just revenge for so great a profanation but alas the miracles at an end for the water returned awhile ago in as great abundance as ever  sect i on the right hand as you descend from this gate of pilgrimstreet is the highfrierchare which leads into newgatestreet there was in this lane a fryery which occasioned it is name  it was situated somewhere about fickettower which is the next round tower to pilgrimgate  this appears from the account of the ward belonging to this tower a part of which is as follows it shall have to ward etc with all greyfryerchare from the barras opposite to the fickettower and the north kirk door of the said fryery westward and no farther eastward in that lane  gray in this part of the town says that in the upper part of this street is a princely house built out of the ruins of the blackfriars  this is contrary to the authority above where it is called the greyfryerchare  and besides it is contrary to several ancient writings which call this chare vicus qui ducit ad fratres minores or the chare of the vide newgate greyfryers so that it is as great a mistake to place the blackfriars here as to say the greyfryers were placed in westgate their situation according to the authority above must have been in the garden of walter blacket esquire in that part of it which is opposite to fickettower and the rest of that garden must have been the garden and other conveniences of this monastery this house was founded by the family of the carliols in the reign of king henry the  d for they were as appears from ancient writings a regular and well settled body in the year       they were originally merchants of this town and afterward landed men  two of this family succeeded peter scott who was the first mayor of newcastle and mayor for three years from the year      to the year       this situation is also confirmed by the milbank manuscript which says that this fryery was near to pilgrimstreetgate and that there is a little lane between it and the walls wherein there is an almshouse but now both the fryery and it are converted to private uses  this almshouse flourished as late as queen marys days for it is said in a writing belonging to mr richard wall of this town the proprietor of these houses that in the year       in the reign of philip and mary it was inhabited by poor religious women inhabitant nunc  pauperes mulieres deo servientes  the greyfryers or as they are properly called the franciscans received their name from st francis born in the duchy of spoletum in italy who was canonized by pope gregory the ninth about two years after whose death the franciscans came into england and one diggs ancestor of sir dudley diggs bought for them their first seat in canterbury  this order for school divinity beat all other orders and had a curious library in london built by richard whittington in that age costing   0 l they afforded in england   0 learned writers fuller  whilst this order flourished in england this province was divided into   pacts or districts called custodies because each of them was governed by the provincial who had charge of them all by a particular superior called custos or keeper who had the power over all the convents within his district or custody the   custodies are as follows the custody or wardenship of london had nine convents that of york seven monasteries that of cambridge seven monasteries that of newcastle nine monasteries viz the custody or wardenship of newcastle of the english province of the franciscans greyfryers or friars minors had nine monasteries  newcastle monastery in northumberland dedicated to st francis dundee dumfries haddington monasteries in scotland carlisle monastery cumberland hartlepool monastery in the bishopric of durham berwick monastery in northumberland roseburg monastery in scotland richmond monastery in the county of richmond in yorkshire this monastry of newcastle was conventual but henry the  th made them observants observant is a branch of the franciscans which are minores tam obsrevantes quam conventuales and capuchini these we find spoken of anno    hen   c    who are called observants because they are not combined together in any cloister convent or corporation as the conventuals are but only by themselves to observe the rules of their order and more strictly than the conventuals do and upon a singularity of zeal separate themselves from them living in certain places of their own choosing of whom you may read hospinian de orig and progress monachatus cap    fol       and therefore by harpsfield is said to be built by him stephens   addit vol  d  amongst the learned men of this order we meet with those of newcastle  john scotus alias duns or duns scotus there was much controversy whether he was an englishman a scot or an irishman he was a man of a mean fortune of a wit made for learning and wonderful subtle and sharp when he had studied some years with great advantage at oxford he returned into northumberland his native country as some will have it and took upon him the habit of st francis at newcastle being afterward sent to oxford he again fell to his studies with great vehemence till he arrived to be doctor and professor of divinity thus he  st expounded the master of sentences at oxford and afterward in the year   0  being appointed professor at paris by the general of the order in the chapter in toulouse he there taught a course of divinity thirdly he did the same at cologne with wonderful applause at which time there arose at cologne the controversy about the conception of the blessed virgin mary whether she was conceived in original sin or not all the followers of albertus magnus affirmed that she was scotus and his adherents positively asserted the contrary here it was that he gained the title of dr subtilis he published a lecture on genesis commentaries on the gospels in   books several books on the epistles of st paul sermons of saints and of particular times two or three pieces on the master of sentences quodlibets theological disputations of the knowledge of god of the perfection of states on all aristotles works and many other things addit seph vol i p     he died miserably   0  being taken with an apoplectick fit and too hastily buried for nature having too late wrought through the distemper he vainly mourned for assistance till at last beating his head against the tombstone he dashed out his brains and so expired whereupon a certain italian wrote thus of him  quaecunque humani suerant jurisque sacrati in dubium veniunt cuncta vocante scoto quid quod and in debium illius sit vita vocata morte illum simili ludificante stropha quum non ante virum vita ingularat adempta quam vivus tumulo conditus ille foret what sacred writings or profane can show all truths were scotus called in doubt by you your fate was doubtful too death boasts to be the first that choused you with a falacy who least your subtle art your life should save before she struck secured you in the grave that he was born here in england i affirm upon the authority of his own manuscript works in the library of mertoncollege oxford which concludes thus explicit lectura subtula etc  here ends the lecture of john duns called doctor subtilis in the university of paris who was born in a certain hamlet in the parish of emeldon called dunston in the county of northumberland belonging to the house of the scholars of mertonhall gib page   0  hugh of newcastle is so called that being the place of his birth he was commonly surnamed the scholastic doctor he was a franciscan and a diligent follower and zealous defender of john scotus he took upon him the habit at newcastle he was one of the fourteen about scotuss tomb he published some things on the master of sentences of the last judgment of the victory against antichrist he lived about the year    0 stephenss  st add vol p     martin alnwick of the town of that name in northumberland took the habit of st francis at newcastle in his youth being afterward sent to study philosophy and divinity at oxford he acquired notable knowledge in both and was made doctor of divinity and reader of the same among his own brethren he writ disputations on the master of sentences and died in the monastery at newcastle he flourished about       st addit vol p     the franciscans of newcastle were prevailed upon to surrender for the abbeys above the value of two hundred pounds were not within the statute of suppressing as were the lesser abbeys on january the  th in the  0th hen  th it consisted of a warden eight friars and two novices  sect ii the house gray mentioned was built out of the ruins of this fryery except the north and south ends of it which were built by sir wm blacket bart the grand father of the present possessor walter blacket esquire  the authority above says also that it is a princely house and indeed it is no less than very stately and magnificent being supposed the most so of any house in the whole kingdom within a walled town it is surrounded with a vast quantity of ground that part of it which faces the street is thrown into walks and grass plats beautified with images and beset with trees which afford a very pleasing shade the other part of the ground on the west side of it is all a garden exceedingly neat and curious adorned with many and the most beautiful statues and several other curiosities  but this house is not more remarkable or memorable upon any account than for it is having been the lodgings of king charles the first whilst he was prisoner at this town  on this same side of the street a little below the house now mentioned is the upperdeanbridge which leads into the middlestreet pullenmarket fleshmarket etc from hence downwards is the most beautiful part of the street the houses on each side of it being most of them very pretty neat and regular such are the houses of mr edward harl mr thomas biggs john rogers esquire thomas clennell esquire nicholas fenwick esquire nathaniel clayton esquire edward collingwood esquire mr perith mr john white john ogle esquire mr thomas waters matthew white esquire etc but there is one house in particular which must be distinguished from the others for it is great antiquity and that is the house abovementioned called the pilgrims inn it is on the west side of the street and adjoins to the north side of the house of mr edward callingwood just now mentioned and is exactly     yards one foot from the southmost corner of upperdeanbridge it is holden of the dean and chapter of durham and belongs at present to mr james hargrave  sect iii below this house on the other side of the street is a lane called manor chare which leads from pilgrimstreet to st austin friars  a little below the east end of this chare on the right hand is the tailors meeting house it was formerly at the very end of the chare in that house which fronts pilgrimstreet which by the marks still remaining of a large window seems to have been a chapel as well as by the tradition of the people thereabouts there is a writing in the custody of this ancient fraternity which i have copied for the curiosity of it and is as follows  to the worship of god and

conquest of england the eighth  a little below this hall of the tailors and the appurtenances thereof was probably the house of laurentius acton which bordered on the south upon the house of the present mr thomas waters this laurentius was mayor of newcastle                     in the reign of henry the  th opposite to this house of laurentius action is the market for wheat and rye every tuesday and saturday  below this again are three narrow lanes two on the west side of the street and one on the east those on the west are the netherdeanbridge leading into st nicholas churchyard which has been spoken of before and the painterhugh or as it is called in a writing as old as edward the thirds reign payntourhogh which leads into the street called the side it is from pilgrimstreet a very great descent into the side but it is made tollerably easy by having stairs on one side of it it seems to have got it is name from the river flowing by the bottom of it up to the netherdeanbridge etc for hugh signifies a steephill or bank and painter is a term made use of by the sailors for a rope which they fasten the boat with this street therefore was called the painterhugh because it was the hugh which the painters were made fast to  one william porter had a house at the end of this street which he granted to john de chambers a burgess of this town in the reign of king edward the third anno      on condition that he paid to the prioress and convent of lambly eighteen shillings per annum  the other lane or street on the east of this street is silverstreet close by the northside of allhallows churchyard it leads into pandon it is said but very improbably to have got it is name of silverstreet because of the fishmarket which was kept a little below it at the stockbridge it was anciently called allhallowgate for allhallowgate is said to be ex part boreali ecclesiae omnium sanctorum it was also called templegate mr nicholas lamb whose house is in this street finds it called jewgate in his writings but when or for what reason it bore that name i know not  we come now to the church of allhallows which stands a little below silverstreet and on the same side of the street with it viz at the very bottom of this pilgrimstreet  sect iv of allhallows church who this church was founded by i have met with no account nor any of the time it was built in only this is certain it must have been built before the year      but how long before i know not for in that year i meet with an account of mr smith p     the churchyard of allhallows which is a plain proof that the church was then in being  gray is of opinion that it was dedicated to allhallows or all saints from the ancient name of that part of the town pampedon which he says was so called from  imagining i suppose that it was so called of the romans allhallows church who inhabited this part of the town after the temple at rome the pantheon which was dedicated to all the gods  this church is seated upon a hill which is much about the same height with the situation of st marys in gateshead and upon the same line with it  it is not so long as st nicholas being only    yards one foot a quarter long but it is broader as being    yards two foot broad the steeple is but or a mean height being a square tower with only one spire arising from it the bells belonging to this church were founded in the year      they were cast out of the metal of that famous statue of king james the second which stood on the sandhill they were founded in the ground belonging to st austin friars in that part of it which is in the backside of the hospital of the holy jesus their sound is not so melodious as the others in this town but the note is exceedingly exact and more tuneful than the others  whatever robert rhodes did to this steeple his name is under the belfry of it as at st nicholas in one of the registers belonging to this church of allhallows we have the following account about the round where the bells are drawn up into the bellhouse in the steeple there is written orate pro anima roberti rhodes his arms are also without at the east end of the church on the breast of an angel which as i take it is a tiger or greyhound on a chief and three annulets on the escutcheon the like is in st nicholas church etc in st johns also on the outside of the south porch over against the almshouse there is on a square orate pro anima roberti rhodes i have also seen the same in tinmouth castle in a round on the northside after you are within the gate upon the wall which belike was in some part of that great church when it was a cell of st albans  upon the east end of the chancel in the southeast window there was the picture of our savior at large but in the time of the rebellion it was wholly taken away  next to it as you go up the south side there was the picture of a boy standing upon checkered pavement as it seemed and on the glass under him like as the jamen moist and cold is full of tempest day by day so is one child of ten years old has no understanding but all on play   the same authority adds i suppose the rest of the months were also in this window in former times but i have seen it only and it was taken away also in the time of the rebellion  in the window above the south door which leads into the quire toward the porch were the pictures of roger thorntons children two men and three women kneeling at altars there remain now only two of the women  there are higher up this isle in the windows toward the porch some characters one is like an i with an s through it and other three characters which are the merchants skinmark for they are but a little different from the skinmark which is upon the stone of christopher elmer it is a token that some merchant was a benefactor to the church and perhaps some part of the south wall of the church i take it to be the skinmark of roger thornton for the very same is in the chantery of st peter over against his tomb  tradition says that from the west end of the vestry to the porch the old south wall was taken away and rebuilt further into the churchyard by roger de thornton that the old wall was farther into the church than the wall now is is plain from the piece of it now remaining which is on the east end of the vestry and i think the pictures in the windows abovementioned is a good confirmation of the truth of the tradition of the builder in that window next the porch door but one there have been the pictures of the twelve apostles there are now only remaining st matthew st james the less st andrew st philip st james major and another  there are three galleries in this church one on the west end and another on the east end of the nave and the other in the northisle that on the west end was built in the year      the organ which was placed in the middle of it was built at the same time it is a very long gallery and by much the most beautiful in the church on the northend of it are the seats of the children belonging to the charityschool the gallery on the west end is called the butchers gallery  the other gallery on the northisle is the sailors gallery it is said in a memorandum made at the bottom of it to have been built and finished by the trinityhouse in newcastle upon tyne in the year      john holbourne then master it was beautified in the year    0 robert bailiff being then master with three or four devices on the south side of it one panel has the picture of st paul s shipwreck another our saviors being asleep in the storm then there is the arms of the trinityhouse another draught is that of our saviors taking peter by the hand when he was sinking in the waves and the other is that of jonah vomited up upon the dry land  the chancel of this church stands upon a large vault which consists of a pretty long entrance arched at the top and of a pretty large square room with a curious pillar in it which is the grand support of eight large stone arches the entrance into this vault is in the churchyard on the northside of it  as you enter into the chancel from the nave of the church you have on the left hand of you an old pair of stairs to which are adjoining the stairs of the butchers gallery these stairs formerly led into the same place but then it was into a gallery different from what the butchers gallery is now they led into a loft or gallery called the rood loft  the rood was an image of our savior upon the cross made generally of wood and placed on a loft made for that purpose just over the passage out of the church into the chancel out of this mystery they say that the church represents the church militant and the chancel the church triumphant and who will pass out of the former into the latter must go under the rood loft that is they must go under the cross and suffer affliction this image was wont to have the virgin mary on one side of it and st john on the other stavely c hist p      a few years ago the chancel was beautifyed it is panneld round with wainscot the table is a large curious marble stone which was given to the church for that use by an unknown hand on the large panel immediately above the altar is this figure i h s or jesus hominum salvator above that again is the picture of a dove curiously carved in wood and above that again in a golden glory is the great name of god  which signifies his most absolute self existence he was and is and is to come  this is to point out by way of emblem the persons of the trinity god the father by the word jehovah he having ordered moses when he went to the israelites to bring them out of egypt to say i exodus iii    am has sent thee or the lord jehovah who exists eternally or always is the dove is the emblem of the holy ghost for he is said to have descended in a bodily shape like a mark iii    dove and the letters with the cross in the middle of them point out the second person of the glorious trinity who dyed upon the cross for the sins of the world  on the top of the east end of the altar above the things now mentioned are the representations of three large candles which are an emblem of the light of the vid vulg antiquit p     and

what they signify no man living knows at present there is no such thing whose name the letters were placed for i believe it is indeed impossible for any man living to tell but as for the catherinewheels it is easy to conclude that they are placed on the southeast end of the church to signify that st catherines chantery or altar was under the southeast window    the chantery of st loye

chanteries of this church we meet with none of the holy trinity but in the   th of the reign of king hen the  th after the mariners became a body and their house was called the trinityhouse we find an altar in it dedicated to the trinity for in one of their writings it is said that thomas hebborne should be partaker of all masses goodprayers and suffrage which should afterward be celebrated said and done by the chaplain and priest of the said fraternity within the trinityhouse and at the trinityaltar within the church of allhallows for evermore  i know not where to fix the place of this altar any more than i can fix particularly the places of some of the ancient chanteries except it was as some will naturally conjecture in the porch behind their gallery and yet there are some reasons against this supposition for this porch was a chantery they had only an altar and as a chantery it must have been filled with a priest who had an altar to himself and consequently their altar must have been some where else if it be said that they perhaps built this porch i answer that if they had done so it would have been called a chantery not only an altar besides the building is visibly older than their chapel their priest or their altar for they can scarce be supposed to have had any one of the three before the beginning of the reign of king henry the eighth and that is a date too late for so old a piece of building  of the burial places and monuments in the southisle some of which are these following nigh the church porch is a large blue stone the burial place of mr william

more could be read than hic tumulatus  dono dei datus mitis clero  promotor ecclesiarum my authority imagines this to be the burial place of robert rhodes he says the picture upon the stone was very like that of roger thornton all the difference is that the gown of this picture is not so deep as that of thorntons he conjectures it to be the burial place of robert rhodes because of the words promotor ecclesiarum lib allhall the words promotor ecclesiarum are not now to be found however had they been there still i think they are but a weak argument to prove that robert rhodes was buried here when it is considered that he founded a chantery in st nicholas that his own soul and his wifes might be prayed for for people were generally buried in the same church and near the very place where they erected a chantery or an altar  but whoever it is this i think may be safely concluded from the grandeur of the grave stone that he was some wealthy person and from his being promotor ecclesiarum that he was also religious  the effigies is very tall and is surrounded with very curious pictures of the saints and some other things but the brass is now tearing off and going very fast

church at the high festival of easter with twenty one gallons of wine  opposite to the west stairs of this church is an almshouse which was in good repair as we are informed by the milbank manuscript about  00 years ago at which time the churchwardens allowed them  0 s per annum for coals for four women it is now in very bad repair and going fast into ruins at present the people in it are allowed eight chaldron of coals per annum and three shillings per quarter by the churchwardens  on the south side of this church are two pair of stairs those opposite to the quiredoor lead into a narrow street called the dogbank but formerly as appears by some ancient writings silverstreet the other pair lead into the butcherbank which is a narrow street and a great descent it is mostly inhabited by butchers who have their shops and houses there in this are many narrow lanes called chares which lead into the keyside this leads into the street called the side and into the sandhill it was called formerly allhallows bank  chap ix of the castleyard in order now to go regularly down into the lower parts of the town let us set off from the south side of the steeple of st nicholas which leads directly to the top of the street called the side whilst i am here i cannot help observing that were the houses belonging to mr partis etc which are situated from the porch door of st nicholas to the said street taken away the belfry and steeple would look much more grand and magnificent and whereas this great ornament of the town is now almost hid as a traveller comes up this street it would then be wholly exposed and strike the beholders with awe and wonder  after you have crossed the upper part of this street there is a passage leading to bailiffgate which has a turn upon the left hand that goes into the castleyard the place where is situated the castle of this town  before the conquest the old round tower was probably in being and was the old castle or fort of monkchester and after the conquest when the other castle was built it was called to distinguish it from the old castle the new castle which in a small time after gave name to the whole place something to this purpose are these two or three words about it in the manuscript of john milbank esquire that this new castle may be distinguished from the old one the use of this tower as the same authority informs us was made to secure the pass to the bridge in former times  this new castle was built by robert curthois the son of william the conqueror in the year  0 0 as has been before observed but notwithstanding this and that it gives a new name to the place yet whatever privileges belonged to monkchester for so the town was then called continued with it nor did the castle impair them in the least  de reb novocast it has been a building of very great strength and very fit for what it was designed and yet in the reign of king john we have an account of it is being repaired by that king and that he was obliged in the making of a ditch to destroy diverse houses for which he satisfied the owners as may be seen in our account of that kings charter to this town  the first account we meet with of it after it was built is of it is being besieged by william rufus for robert mowbray earl of northumberland having opposed him he came down and laid siege to the castle and conquered newcastle upon which robert fled and absconded in bamburghcastle but was afterward taken by the kings party and carried prisoner to windsor  among several rents and revenues arising to this castle the following were some  the barony of the william herron hen i eum feost herons which contained one william regularly descended from this william died in the   th of edward the  st and left no male issue so that emelin his only daughter was the heir of the barony she married into the family of john lord d arcy and transferred this manor of haddeston and diverse others into that family lord d arcy abovementioned died possessed of this manor at norton in lincolnshire  0th edward the  d in the  st of hen iv thomas lord lumley died possessed of it and left it to sir john lumley his brother this family is so named from lomley a town situated on the bank of the river were where their seat was they are descended from liulph a person of great nobility in the time of king edward the confessor who married algitha the daughter of aldred earl of northumberland sir george lumley knight he that married the granddaughter of roger thornton of this town was in great repute in the county of durham in the reign of edward the  th being high sheriff in the  d of that reign in the  th knight of the shire in the year   high sheriff again in which office he continued three years more  but none of this great and ancient family was ever higher in the esteem of his prince none in greater repute in his country than is the present noble successor richard earl of scarborough who is also viscount lumley and waterford baron lumley of lumley master of the horse to his majesty lord lieutenant of the counties of durham and northumberland knight of the most noble order of the garter one of his majestys most honorable privy council etc   haddeston chirton this village is about two short miles distant from the town of newcastle how it came out of the hands of this family of the herons is not known but in the   th of edward the  d it was the lordship of jeffrey de scrope of masham in yorkshire after him ralph lord graystake was lord of it in the reign of k henry the  th this manor was in the possession of william fitz hugh who died and left it to his son henry it is now in the possession of mr tho bigg and mrs jane sanderson who have there a house and garden at which they reside in the summer season

side of the tyne called in old books and ancient records devilstone from a small brook running on the west side of it whose name bid says was devilsburn and emptying itself into tyne the barony in which it stands takes it is name from it and is at this day called the barony of devilstone we have not yet met with the original barons of it we observe a family in our ancient histories bearing the surname of deivill or deiville which might probably be owners of the manor of devilstone i e the town of devils for john deiville was governor of scarborough castle in yorkshire and built a castle of his own at a certain place called the hode in that county but having no ground for this conjecture in history we shall leave it to the reader to accept or reject it though the name being a little unusual and looking as if its original were derived from the evil spirit that bears that name we thought fit to give some account of it  bid in the same place viz lib   c   tells us that here it was that s oswald armed with the christian edith slew in a fair field cedwell the briton a wretched tyrant who had before slain two kings of northumberland osrick king of the deirans and eanfrid of the bernicians and miserably wasted their country but the author of the additions of cambden contradicts mr cambden and tells us that all the latin copies of bid that he had seen say that oswalds victory was obtained in loco qui lingua anglorum denisesburn vocatur i e in the place called by the english deniesburn and the saxon copies of king alfreds paraphrase have denisses deni ces and denises burna and the saxon chronicle has not made any mention of this story  sir francis ratcliffe or radelive bart descended of the ancient family of ratcliffs earls of sussex who was made a baron of this realm march         did bear the title of baron of dilston viscount ratcliff and langley and earl of derwentwater in cumberland he died anno       and was buried in the church of this place the last earl of this family was james ratcliffe he was beheaded on tower hill anno      for being concerned in the rebellion of that year   devil or dilstone corbidge a town situated upon the north bank of the river tine which takes it is name from the bridge laid there over that river for traffic into the southern parts of the county and the rest of england and the ancient roman name found in antonines itinerary called corstopitum or rather corstopilum as it is read in the edition of h surita which as henry of huntington testifies was for brevity sake called cure or cor here according to the description of ptolomy was the curia ottodinorum i e the court of the ottodini or northumbrians the manor of this town   ed   or soon after was purchased by henry percy a wealthy northumbrian who was then in great favor with that prince he making a settlement of his great estate in the  th of edw the  d gave two parts of this manor to his son and heir henry percy which he then was in possession of and the third part after the death of hawise the widow of john clavering who held it then in dower but this henry died seized of the whole manor feb       edw   and left it with other great estates to his son and heir of the same name who accordingly soon after the livery of his lands saving to his mother idonea her reasonable dower who had assigned her for it among other lordships this of corbridge which was not long come into his possession but it was settled upon his death upon his secured wife joan for her dower how this manor was alienated in the same reign we cannot discover but do find  0 rich  d that alice the widow of ralph lord nevil of raby had for her dowry among other manours and rents twenty pounds per ann out of his manor of corbrigge  at this day there is nothing remarkable in this town but the church and a little towerhouse fitted up and inhabited by the vicars of the place yet there are so many ruins of ancient buildings as prove it once to have been a large and spacious town king john supposing that either an earthquake or some sudden invasion might be the cause of so great desolations and the inhabitants had no time or way to remove their wealth did not doubt but he might find a great deal of treasure upon a diligent search but fortune favored his attempt no more than it did neros in his enquiries after the concealed riches of dido at carthage for he found nothing but stones marked with brass iron and lead the vicarage of this town being  all a value as not to be a suitable maintenance for the minister the dean and chapter of carlisle since the restoration of king charles ii made an augmentation to it of  0 lib per annum  but though king john discovered nothing considerable here yet there was found out accidentally about  0 years ago a thing very remarkable the bank of a small torrent which comes down from the walls side by this town being worn away by some impetuous land floods the skeleton of a man appeared of a very extraordinary and prodigious size the length of his thigh bone was within a very little of two yards and the skull teeth and other parts proportionably monstrous so that by a fair computation the true length of the whole body may be will reckoned at seven yards some parts of it were in the possession of the right honorable the late earl of derwentwater at dilston in      who was much pleased with the rarity but his lordship not having notice of it till it was in a great measure squandred away and lost by the careless discoverers he could not by all his inquiries make it so complete as any that have a regard to such curiosities could heartily wish it were but since there was not found here an entire skeleton but great numbers or strata of teeth and bones of a very extraordinary size and withal a sort of pavement or foundation of stone running along with these strata and since here has an altar inscribed to hercules been dug up what if we should affirm that these are the teeth and bones of oxen and other like creatures which were sarificed at the temple dedicated to hercules standing in this place ex mag brit   corbrigg togeston etc paid to the castle  l s d for castleward 00    0  for cornage

for himself and his heirs by the service of three knights fees but because he did not make performance to king john of what he expected the king seized his estate and reg   bestowed this manor upon robert fitz roger in whose posterity it continued till john fitz robert who leaving the old fashion of framing sirnames out of the christian names of their fathers as his ancestors had done and was hitherto used by many families laid aside the name of fitz robert and at the command of king edward the  st took the name de clavering dying without any legitimate issue he settled great part of his estate on king edward the  st and his heirs and the rest was either sold in his lifetime or left to his own heirs this manor by what title we know not is found to be in the family of the scroops of masham for    ed  d sir geffery scroop banneret died seized of this manor of whalton with many other estates which he left to his son and heir henry in whose posterity who were summoned to parliament

church of bolton in yorkshire and held it till the restoration of king charles when he came into possession of whalton he was a person of eminency for his conduct as well as learning and was several

of the wall hedwin east thornton whitchester haughton of benwall  mr cambden speaking of chester on the street says he supposes it to have been the condercum where upon the line of the wall the first win of the astures kept garrison in the roman times as the notitia tells us and this he conjestures because in the saxon chestre is called concester and because it is but a few miles from the wall but others are of opinion that benwall a village about two miles west of newcastle was the ancient condercum because of the antiquity of the place and its nearness to the wall the notitia described the condercum as upon the line of the wall  this indeed seems rather probable for if a place is said to be situated ad lineam valli one would think it should not be far from the wall however not in the wrong side of tine the places of the roman garrisons ad lineam valli as far as i can judge have always been in these counties which the roman wall past through but no body seen yet found out the least

man in the reign of king john and by him entrusted with the government of diverse castles at times to defend them against the rebellious barons which he did faithfully and to his own advantage for  d henry iii it was certified that the barony of this robert now as we conceive called the barony of caugif for gaugi in this county consisted of this and diverse other manours which he held of the king by the service of three knights fees this manor is now the property of robert lawson esquire of chirton   crawlington heaton is a small village distant from newcastle about a mile and a half eastward it has been handed down by tradition to the present day that it was a place of retreat for king john when he came into this country and there are still to be seen the ruins of an ancient building now in the possession of richard ridley esquire which carries the name of king john s palace whatever truth there may be in this tradition this is certain that there is in the said gentlemans ground on the northside of this old building the remains of a fortification which it is natural to conjecture was built for the safety and security of this house and consequently this house must have been of some great distinction and when it is further considered that this village of heaton is a part of the barony of robert de gaugy it may not be improbable to conclude that this ancient building has in some measure been what tradition says it was for robert de gaugy was a great man in the reign of king john and was entrusted by him as has just now been observed with the government of diverse castles at times to defend them against the rebellious barons which he did faithfully and to his own advantage for in the  d of henry iii it was certified that the barony of this robert in this county consisted of this and the other manours which he held of the king by the service of three knights fees  this robert therefore might have had his own house here upon this part of his barony and as he was so faithful a servant to king john and entrusted by him with matters of such great concern it is not improbable but when the king came to these parts he lodged at this house and this perhaps was the reason of its getting the name it hears at this day  this is its ancient grandeur its present is the house and family of the worthy gentleman above mentioned it was built in the year      it is a beautiful house and so situated that on the west it overlooks the townmoor fenham and part of the lands of the prior of tinmouth on the east it faces the sheilds road on the north it has a most agreeable prospect to the windings of the ouseburn of its woods and banks and of the villages situated on it on the south it faces the river tine its conveniences and beauties about it are on the west

adorned with variety of knots and flowers in this area at a due distance are two images tall as the life which declare the hand of a curious statuary on the north are gardens and plantations and on the south an area adorned with images and a pleasing gravelwalk beset with trees and bordered with flowers  this gentleman the possessor was eldest son to nicholas ridley esquire who was born at

warranty the king upon mature advice with such noblemen as were of his council discerning that he had a good right to it quitted his claim to him this robert not long after this fell in love with a scotch woman and having a mind to get her for his wife not only joined himself with the scots but endeavored to engage his kinsman on their side viz william de ros of hemlake who detesting such

new wall which was built to enclose the the high and great heap viz the dunghill on the westside of the castle was taken away by sir john marley mayor and his adherents to rampart the townwalls against the parliament and commonwealth dunghill from thence it goes to the corner of the house of  and thence by the backpart of the house of  where the ancient outward wall begins this ancient outward wall of the castle contains by measure three acres of ground and one rood  in the   th of this kings reign another inquisition was held at newcastle about the castle wherein complaint was made of the dunghill mentioned in the bounds of the castle that it had increased to such a bigness that it was in length    yards the depth of it was  0 yards and the breadth of it    yards which being such a prodigious weight upon the wall on the west side of the castle which wall was in length  0 yards in height  0 yards in breadth   yards that a great part of it is entirely thrown down and subverted to the great detriment of the strength of the castle the damage was computed at   0 l  it was also by this same inquisition complained of that the great square tower was full of chinks and crannies and that one third of it was almost taken away that all the lead and covering which it had of old was imbezled and carried of insomuch that the prisoners of the county of northumberland were most miserably lodged by reason of the showers of rain falling upon them they computed the charge of repairing it would be  0  l    s 0 d  it has been a building of great strength and no little beauty the vast thickness of the walls speaks the one and the ruins of some curious workmanship speaks the other the grand entrance into the castle was at the gate facing the south which leads up a pair of stairs which still show the magnificence of the builder to a very stately door of curious masonry the room this leads into has its floor broken down close to the castlewall as indeed all the other floors are to the top of the castle so that excepting the floor above the countygoal there is not one left though there have been five divisions or stories of the castle besides this this floored room which i was told was lately flaggd by the order of william ellison esquire alderman when he was last mayor in the year      seems to me without any doubt to have been the common hall of the castle because on the northside of the same room there is an entrance by a descent of some steps into a room where is the largest fireplace i saw in the castle which plainly speaks it to have been the kitchen at the end of this there are several stairs which lead into a place under the kitchen which i think goes down as low as the bottom of the castle this i take to have been a cellar as i do also that little dark place on the right hand coming up again to have been a sort of a pauntry  the door i mentioned just now on the east of the castle which leads to the first broken down floor is because of it is grandeur and beauty an argument that this room has been the most stately one in the whole castle another reason for it is being so is because of the windows which gave light into it those of them that face the east are the most beautiful of the whole castle besides on the south of this room there is an entrance into a sort of a parlour or withdrawingroom which has a fire place in it which has been a piece of curious workmanship as is visible to this day and this place has no communication with any part of the castle but this room on the northside of this room is a door leading into an apartment where stands a well of a considerable depth it was    yards before we touched the surface of the water which seems to have been placed there on purpose for the more immediate service of this room there are some little basins on the top of the well with pipes leading from them which conveyed water to different appartments of the castle this is plain from what may be observed in the county goal at the bottom of the castle the round stone pillar in it having an hollow in the middle of a foot wide with a lead spout in the side of it  in the inquisition made in the  th of edward  d abovementioned among other things that were complained of for being neglected one was capella domini regis infra castrum this chapel i have been told stood on that part of the castle yard where the moothall is but upon searching i found it in the castle itself according to the account of it just now mentioned the door of it is at the bottom of the south wall of the castle adjoining to the stairs which lead into the state chamber it has been a work of great beauty and ornament and is still in the midst of dust and darkness by far the most beautiful place in the whole building the inside of it being curiously adorned with arches and pillars it is easy to observe the different parts of it the entrance the body of it and the chancel on the left side of the entrance you go into a dark little room which undoubtedly was the vestry the full length of it is    yards the breadth of it is   yards and half it had   or   windows toward the east which are now all filled up nor is there any light but what comes in at a little cranny in the wall  nicholas de byker tenet terras suas ut faciat districtiones ad ward novi castelli super tynam faciend and pro deb domini regis inter tynam and cocket etc and then my authority goes on to say that the manor of byker was sir ralph lawsons knight deceased after of henry lawson esquire his son and now of his eldest son who without all question is bailiff by inheritance of the said castle and is to levy these castleward cornage and other rents issues fines and amerciaments belonging to the said castle and as he goes on the constable of the castle when that office is settled may appoint the learned stewards to keep courts and then the officers for the said castle will be complete besides the rents abovementioned a great number of houses yards and gardens paid to it  in the   th of james i      a grant was made of the site and demesnes of the castle to alexander stephenson esquire who was succeeded by one patrick black who died and left it in the possession of his wife after that one james langton gent claimed patrick blacks right but by virtue of what is not known  the liberties and privileges of the castle extends northwards to the river of tweed and southward to the river of tees  it is reported that underneath that house which was anciently the county goal is a vault which leads to the castle there is indeed a large door still to be seen which perhaps was the entrance into it and mr george gray the present possessor of the house told me that it was certainly so because he had put down through his own floor a bailiffs rod to the very end and could find no bottom  a manuscript i have often had occasion to mention gives us the following account of the castleyard  the way through the yard begins at the castleyate and when i was young there was no houses in it but the house of one thomas southern and the house of one green these houses were near the gate before you came into the castleyard and there was in the garth a house wherein the jailer of the castle dwelt and a house wherein william robinson dwelt who was deputy herrald under norroy king at arms this man wrote in a book the arms of all the mayors of this town from laurentius acton until his time and when i was chamberlain of the town which was about the time of sir nicholas coles being mayor in the year    0 it was then in the towns chamber when trollop built the towncourt he borrowed it but would never restore it  these were all the houses at that time but since then mr bulmer he took a garth behind his house in the side and built a stable in it and had a garden in it and also george hayroy took from thence to the moathall and built houses upon it he was a butcher but not a freeman and these took their lands and houses of alexander stephenson a scottish man who came in with king james for he begged the castle of the king he was one of his closestool this man began to build the castlegate but it was finished by one john pickle who made it in the fashion it is now and kept a tavern in it and then one jordan a scotsman and swordkipper built the house on the south side of the gate and lived in it and thomas reed a scotch pedlar took a shop in the northside of the gate  at present there are a good many shops and houses belonging to it in and about it  chap x of the lower parts of the town having now considered the castle and what belongs to it we return back to the side the street from which we entered the castleyard  sect i the side this street is from the head of it to the stairs on the left hand a very great descent and lies narrow until you come to the middle of it from which place it opens in a spacious breadth and so continues to the sandhill it is from the one end to the other filled with shops of merchants goldsmiths milliners upholsters etc the east side of this street from the upper part of it to allhallow pant was called cordiner or cordwainer raw  above the middle of the street are stairs leading up to the castleyard which was the easternpostern of the castle and after called the waste of laurentius acton as appears from the account of gunner tower and our townsman gray says that in the middle of this street is an ancient stonehouse an appendix to the castle which in former times belonged to the lord lumley before the castle was built or at least coetany with the castle  on the other side of this street opposite to the waste now mentioned is a corner shop which formerly belonged to a chantery in st johns church on the same side of this street almost opposite to this easternpostern of the castle is a short narrow lane which formerly seems to have gone by the name of vide gunnertower swinburnplace which leads by stairs into a dark narrow lane which faces the painter heugh that leads into pilgrimstreet on the northend of this lane there was a place called vide gunnertower pencher place perhaps the whole lane was called so it goes as far as the netherdeanbridge under which is now a warehouse of mr james moncaster merchant under this i am told the rings are still to be seen that the boats were fastened to which brought up the merchant goods when the merchants had their shops in the fleshmarket on the south it leads to the side  the pant standing near the shop of mr robert makepeice is undoubtedly that which went by the name of allhallowpant the other side of the street from allhallowpant to the calecross was formerly divided by the coming up of the river which was called lorkburn and the east of it had the name of flesherraw because i suppose the butchers had their shops there as well as on the butcherbank the west bore the name of the side after that lorkburn was covered with flags at the top and made one street which all goes by the name of the side in the year      lorkburn was arched at the top and paved over  we come now to the calecross so called because of the cale or broth which was sold there in former times this seems to have been it is original name for i meet with it in the reign of king richard the second as may be seen in the account of st margarets chantery in st nicholas and also in a writing dated edward the third what gray says of it is still just that it is a fair cross with columns of stone hewn covered with lead there is at the top of it a cistern which holds the newwater here is sold milk eggs cheese butter etc  from the cross the street has the name of calecross till you come to the sandhill which leaving the butcherbank that leads to allhallows church on the left hand you come immediately to  sect ii sandhill the sandhill is so called because it was formerly a hill of naked sand when the tide was out for formerly the tyne overflowed all this place after it was taken in it became part of the town that part of it on the west side of lorkburn was a place of pleasure and recreation for the townspeople for in the reign of richard the  d a proclamation was made commanding to remove all merchandise from a certain common place in newcastle called sandhill where the inhabitants were wont to assemble for their recreation  it is a spacious place and adorned with buildings very high and stately whose rooms speak the ancient grandeur being very large and magnificent it is now that part of the town where the chief affairs of trade and business are transacted the shops in this street are almost altogether those of merchants which have many of them great conveniences of lofts garners and cellars  here is the market for fish herbs bread cloth leather etc which for the one part of things viz those to be wore is kept every tuesday and saturday for things to be eat every day  on the south side of the street is the ancient hospital called the hospitale novicastri super tynam in comitatu northumbriae vocatum thorntons hospital  licentia henrici regis quarti rogero de thornton concessa pro fundatione ejusdem  rex etc sciatis quod de gratia nostra

the house of god it was founded by that great benefactor roger thornton in the reign of king henry the fourth upon the death of his wife for a chaplain to pray for the soul of the said roger as long as he lived and after he was dead and for the souls of his father and mother and agnes his late wife etc this priest was called the guardian or keeper of the said hospital because of the care he had over nine poor men and four poor women who resided there these poor people were called the brethren and sisters of st katharines hospital for to this saint was the hospital dedicated  in the   th of henry vi roger thornton granted to the mayor and community of newcastle the use of the hall and kitchen belonging to the hospital of the blessed katharine the virgin on the sandhill  in the year      sir richard lumley in consideration of  00 l conveyed to the mayor and burgesses of newcastle and their successors for ever all that building of stone covered with lead standing near to the water of tine and to the eastpart of the towns chamber being about    yards in length and anciently part of the hospital of st katharine the virgin  gray upon this building stands the stately court of the merchantadventurers of the old staple resident at that flourishing city of antwerp in brabant since removed to the more northern provinces under the states their charters are ancient their privileges and immunities great they have no dependence upon london having a governor twelve assistants two wardens and a secretary the present governor is richard ridley esquire alderman of this town who has been governor of this company for many years  this room in ancient times as we are informed by the milbank manuscript was given to the town for a young couple when they were married to make their weddingdinner in and receive the offerings and gifts of their friends for at that time houses were not large it is true indeed the houses in the fleshmarket which were built many years before this upon the sandhill had most of them rooms near as stately if not altogether as stately as this room is but then they were the houses of the great merchants and aldermen of the town so that the tradition of this room may be true enough  this hall is adorned with the arms of several generous benefactors and some of the most curious carved work in wood here it is that for some years by past the annual feast of the sons of the clergy has been held  adjoining to the west end of this ancient building was the towncourt which was built by that worthy man roger thornton this was pulled down and the present one erected anno      alderman weimoth by will dated the   th of april gave   00 l toward it and the town was at the rest of the charge which amounted to above  0000 l mr joshua douglas the town clerk accounts for it in this manner  l s d in the year      in october the town paid robert trollop for building the court      00 00 in the year    0 there is ordered more in full  00 00 00 the purchasemoney paid phineas allen for part of the ground where the court is built which had houses on it but were then pulled down  trollop had as mr douglas also acquaints us  0 l for setting up the kings arms in the court and bridge and  0 more for finishing them and making the conduit on the sandhill  this building as to its form and model is of great beauty and withal very sumptuous that part of it which is the court itself is a very stately hall whose lofty cicling is adorned with various painting and its floor laid with checkered marble on the east end of it is a dial and the entrance into the merchants court on the west are the benches where the magistrates sit raised considerably above the floor of the court above which are the pictures of king charles ii and king james ii large as the life on the north a gallery for spectators and on the south the windows which are very pretty particularly that window which is a katharinewheel in which is a large sundial of painted glass with this motto eheu fugaces under this is a large balcony which overlooks the river here it is that the mayor and sheriff keep their courts and the judges at lammas hold the assize here is kept the guilds the court of admiralty etc  on the northside of this hall is a magnificent entrance into a passage which leads into a large room called the towns chamber here it is that the mayor transacts the common business of the town here the common council is held where the mayor sits on a bench distinguishable from the others the aldermen on each side of him the common council below upon chairs placed on each side the room and separated from the benches as the court itself is separated from the benches there and here upon the days of rejoicing the state holidays the mayor not long ago entertained the magistrates and burgesses with a banquet of wine etc to which they were wont to come from the mayors house with great pomp and solemnity at the west end of the room is a small apartment or withdrawing room where the magistrates upon occasion retire where the ancient records of the town are kept etc under this court and chambers are the weighhouse and townhouse the former is for weighing all sorts of commodities for in the reign of king henry vi brass weights according to the standart were sent to this town the latter is the place where the clerk of the chamber and the chamberlain are to receive the revenues of the town for coal salt ballast grindstone etc gray   before i leave this street i must by no means omit the effigies of king james ii which stood here as i have been told on that side of the bullring next the courtstairs by the account i have had for i never saw the statue itself nor the picture of it it must have been a very curious work the kings picture on horseback was cast in copper large as the life the horse stood upon his hindfeet raised upon a pedestal of white marble which was surrounded with ironpales it cost the town   00 l and was confessed the most beautiful and curious of its kind that was in the whole kingdom certainly it was a great ornament to the town and it is therefore great pity it is not still in being though it was the statue of an unfortunate king but there is no bounds to the heady proceedings of a furious mob it drives all before it without either reason or reflection and bears no regard to things either civil or religious such a one i am told was this that pulled down the noble statue a few soldiers as drunk with loyalty as with liquor assisted by the busy hotheaded genius of sandgate having provided ropes for that purpose pulled it down dragged it from thence to the key and threw it into the river this was in the year      it was afterward taken up again and part of it cast into a set of bells which now belong to allhallows in this town  sect iii the close on the east of this street is the entrance to the keyside which shall be spoken hereafter on the west is the close to which as you go along you pass by the northside of the chapel of st thomas the martyr and on the other side opposite to this chapel an ancient house which is said to be built by richard de emmeldon mayor of newcastle for three priests to pray for his soul i take it to be nigh those stairs which lead up to the half moon the ancient outward fortification  from hence going on still westward you cross over the northend of the tinebridge and so pass into the street called the closs it answers its name exactly well for it is but narrow and close too it was formerly that part of the town where the principal inhabitants lived sir john marly sir william blacket sir mark milbank and the houses of many other gentlemen of figure are still remembered by the ancient inhabitants and indeed however the street itself may be however mean the fronts of the houses are within they speak magnificence and grandeur the rooms being very large and stately and for the most part adorned with curious carving the earl of northumberlands house was in this street it was that house which has at its entrance a great gate besides which there is a large round ball of stone the house on this side mr thorp stewarts in the lower part of this building toward the water are very manifest tokens of its antiquity  of late years these houses have been forsaken and their wealthier inhabitants have chosen the higher parts of the town  on the right hand as you enter the street from the tinebridge are stairs which lead into the castleyard which were the southern postern of the castle and are called the castlestairs on the same side a little further along are other stairs which are called the long stairs which lead up to the bailiffgate backraw castleyard side etc almost opposite to which is a small key called javelgripp somewhat further along are other stairs on the same side of the street leading to westgate which are called tudhillstairs perhaps it is not amiss to tell you what i have been somewhere informed of that the proper name of it should be touthill from the touting or winding of a horn upon it when an enemy was at hand what makes me the more inclineable to believe this tradition to be true is that cornage was paid to the castle as may be seen in our account of it now cornage comes from the word cornagium from cornu a horn and was a kind of grand serjeanty the service of which tenure was to blow a horn when any invasion of the scots was perceived and by this many men held their land northward about the picts wall cambd britan  0  page and littleton fol     almost opposite to these stairs is the house of the mayors of newcastle where they reside during the year of their mayoralty it is a building grand and stately and considering the place it stands in is very ornamental as the mayors of newcastle have such continual business at court though the situation is not so pleasing as that of the upper part of the town it is yet more advantageous as it is nigher the court  beyond this house a little way still going on westward is the gate belonging to this street called the closegate the townwall descends from the westfriar tower down a dangerous pair of stairs upon a very steep bank to this gate from which it goes southward to the waterside where is an old tower now the hall of the sailmakers  without this close gate is a way to the forth a place of recreation  in the close were many houses which pay an annual rent to the master and brethren of st mary the virgin  this street is commemorated in many ancient writings for a mill which in ancient times long before these were drawn was wont to stand upon the hoga that is upon the bank without the closegate in a grant from the master and brethren of st marys in westgate it is permitted to the parties concerned that they have quandam placeam terrae in vico quoe vocatur le closs sicut se extendit in longitudine de hoga ubi antiquum molidinum solebat stare usque ad aquam tinae and quantum de tina acquirere poterit  sect iv tinebridge in coming into the close we crossed the end of the the bridge is of great antiquity undoubtedly as old as the times of the romans there must have been a communication between this and the other side of the river and therefore there was a necessity for it the ingenious mr horsley p  0  says i think there are some certain and visible remains of a military way on gatesheadfell pointing directly toward the part where i suppose the station has been at newcastle and coming as i apprehend from chester le street dr hunter assured me he had also observed visible remains of such a way and it is the common opinion that there has been a military way from chester to newcastle this way tends toward the place where the bridge now is there must then have been a bridge in the roman times over the river tine near the place where the present bridge stands   tinebridge let us now return and consider it a little it has been a query whether the bridge was originally of wood or stone but i think it is altogether needless all the bridges in england were originally of wood in the reign of richard i philip bishop of durham sent to the burgesses of gateside a grant of forestage in which are these words and it shall be lawful for every burgess to give wood to whomsoever he will to be spent about the river of tine without any license this i imagine has been for the building of keys and especially for the repairing of the bishops part of the bridge which is a further proof that this bridge which was the original one was wood but what i think puts it beyond dispute is that according to matthew paris it was burnt in the year      together with a great part of the town  after this misfortune happened the town who repairs two thirds of the bridge and the thomas ruthall bishop of durham in the reign of henry vii built or repaired the third part of the bridge over the river tine toward the south goodwin bishop the other laid out their endeavors to raise up another bridge of stone accordingly the bishop of durham sent out indulgences and the town procured other bishops to do the same to all those that would assist either with money or labor in the erecting of it by which means they got such a sum as was sufficient  the archdeacon of northumberland wrote to the clergy of his archdeaconry and desired them to assist the work of the bridge as much as they could telling them their venerable father the lord bishop of durham by his letters patents had commanded them without any let or delay to go about the affair of indulgences and that they were to prefer the episcopal indulgences to others and what arose from them was to be given to the master of the bridge who was then laurentius for the use of the bridge lib cart  in like manner the official of carlisle promised an indulgence of  0 days to any one that would assist the repairing of tinebridge  walter bishop of rochester on the  th of the ides of september in the year of our lord      granted an indulgence of  0 days to all that bestowed part of the substance god had given them to the repairing of the tinebridge or would assist the repairing of it by working at it with their own hands  it is supposed by some that william st barbara sent the following indulgence but that cannot be for he lived a great while before the bridge was built it was therefore walter bishop of durham who in the  th year of his pontificate sent it dated at weremouth  walterus dei gratia dunelm epis dilectis in christo filiis archidiacon officialibus decan parsonis vicariis

durham eternal health  forasmuch as the apostle says that we must all stand before the judgment seat of christ to receive as we have done in the body whether it be good or bad we ought to prevent the day of the last harvest by doing works of mercy and looking toward heavenly things and to sow on earth what we shall reap in heaven with manifold fruit holding a firm hope and trust because he that sowes in peace shall reap in peace and he that sows in blessings shall of blessings also reap and shall reap eternal life seeing then that the tinebridge wants abundance of repairs and cannot be sustained without large alms we command to admonish those that are under you and efficaciously bring them to give alms of the things which god has bestowed on them and that for the sake of charity they would bestow on the work what they can that by their own aid and assistance a work of this kind may be restored and relying on the mercy of the omnipotent god and on the merits and intercession of the blessed apostles peter and paul we release all those our parishioners truly repenting and confessing who shall piously contribute of the things god has sent them to the repairing and sustaining the said bridge we mercifully release them from the smallest penance for twenty days to come  sewaldus archbishop of york on the ides of september in the year of our lord      granted an indulgence of  0 days to come to every one that bestowed any thing toward the building and repairing of tinebridge  andrew bishop of cathness in scotland gave liberty by a grant to collect alms throughout his whole diocese for the repairing of the tynebridge  the bishop of waterford in ireland granted also to those that would assist the repairing of the tynebridge in newcastle upon tine a promise of being prayed for in the cathedral church of the holytrinity in waterford and in the other churches of his diocese and also an indulgence for  0 days  amongst the many benefactors occasioned by these means are these following  john the son of decanus and bartholomew the son of william son of benedict guardians of the alms collected for the support of the tinebridge with the council and assent of the mayor bailiffs and burgesses confirmed to gervasius the son of ralph that whole land with every thing belonging to it in the fields of jesemuthia which henry de bulmar and ralph gave and by their carts confirmed to the said tinebridge etc on condition that he rendered to the said tinebridge one plank or six shillings annually at the feast of st michael adam de jesumuthia was the first witness to this grant  adam of jesumuthia granted to god and to the tinebridge on account of the soul of william de greenville and the souls of his ancestors part of the ground in the land of jesumuth  some of the witnesses to this chart were gilbert de valle adam de plessy gilbert de oggell william de byker elge de gosford  richard de northesold and hugh of london gave nine shillings and six pence out of certain lands lying in the vico fori to the repairing of the bridge one stephen of benwell is mentioned in this grant as having land adjoining to that out of which this money is granted  some of the

st thomas the martyr as may be observed in the account of those charities  in the   d of edward the  d an inquisition was made whereby it was found that the bridge was so decayed that  000 l would not repair it and that  0 marks belongs to the said bridge and to the chapel of st thomas the martyr built upon the same  0 whereof was paid to the master of the said chapel for himself and his clerk and the remaining ten marks to the bridge master builder  this bridge after it was repaired stood upon    bold arches but now there are only   the rest being turned into cellaring at the building of the keys it is a pretty street beset with houses on each side for a great part of it in the entrance from the north into it stands the chapel of st thomas the martyr sometime archbishop of canterbury so called because it was dedicated to him who the founder of it was i have never been able to learn nor the time of it is building but it must have been after the year      the year when the martyr suffered and it must have been built before the year      because then it was in being  in this chapel were three chanteries  the chantery of st anne in the chapel of st thomas upon tinebridge was founded by william herryng valued at   l    s and arose out of certain tenements on the sandhill  the chantery of our lady in the said chapel no deed of foundation to be showed but the incumbent now being is resident upon the same and he and his predecessors some say always presented by the mayor of newcastle for the time being and christopher threkeld patron valued at   l   s   d which arose out of certain tenements in the close and side  another chantery of our lady founded by george carr merchant of newcastle but never licenced valued at   l   s   d out of the sandhill and the side  some of the masters of the chapel are these following  william de stanhope custos capellae sancti thomae martyris anno      and       nicholas de stockton magister capellae beati thomae martyris       in the

perhaps mr robert bonner was second upon whose death mr thomas davison was chosen      qui obiit       the present master is the rev dr thomlinson  this chapel was lately beautified and pewed and on sunday the  0th of september      the whole body of the magistrates coming to it with the usual solemnities and formalities was set apart by the corporation for a chapel of ease to the church of st nicholas the sermon in the morning was preached by the rev mr vicar that in the afternoon by the rev mr clayton the officiating ministers are the rev mr cowling who preaches on the sunday morning and the rev mr cuthberts and the rev mr clayton on the sunday afternoon alternately  a little beyond this is a large and strong building which gray informs us was built a little before the writing of his history upon an arch of the bridge and used for a magazine for the town under this are the shops of francis rudston esquire alderman and mr william sorsby there is very visible above this gateway the remains of a port cullice after the restoration the picture of king charles the  d was set up on the south side of this building with this motto under it adventus regis solamen gregis the coming of the king is the comfort of the people it was wont to look exceedingly beautiful and in coming along the bridge from the south was a very worthy and conspicuous ornament to the town but of late it is pretty much obscured with dust if not defaced with the weather through the want of being put into a little order and regularity  on the northside of this building is an account of it is being repaired in the year      henry reay esquire mayor joseph green esquire sheriff  after you come from under the gateway of the magazine there is an open on the bridge on either side over the one of these it was that surprising accident happened to mr anderson a merchant and alderman this town as he was looking over the bridge talking with a friend he fingered a ring he had on as people frequently do when they are thoughtful which before he was aware fell into the river and was given entirely over for lost sometime after one of his servants having bought a salmon in the market found the very ring in the belly of the fish and restored it to his master herodotus gives the like account in the  d book of polycrates king of samos who was at that time esteemed one of the favorites of fortune which as my authority observes may satisfy us of the truth of solomons saying there is no new thing under the sun  this gentleman was mayor of newcastle and was ancestor of the present mr abraham anderson merchant on the sandhill the said francis anderson made his estate to his son henry anderson who was the father of the said abrahams grandfather the estate and ring have been in the family ever since and are now in the possession of the said abraham i my self saw this ring about   months ago the impression the seal gives is that of soloman and the queen of sheba on the inside of the ring just under the signet is the picture of a salmon in commemoration of the fish and the transaction on the one side of which is the letter f and on the other the letter r in commemoration of the person it is a curiosity so great that not only the whole kingdom cannot show the like of it but the whole world beside nay the world itself never that we know of had the like transaction but once before viz that beforementioned the gentleman therefore who has this valuable jewel in his possession ought to have the utmost care of it upon many accounts and as none of the least that it is a credit to his family as well as to the town  a little further about the middle of the bridge is a large old tower which they call the tower of the bridge where lewd and disorderly persons are kept till they are examined by the mayor and brought to due punishment except the crime be of a very gross nature and then are removed to newgate and there continue till the assizes beyond this a little is the bluestone which gives the name of the bluestone to that part of the bridge here is the bounds of newcastle southwards beyond this the other part of the bridge belongs to the county palatine of durham and is repaired by the bishop at the end of the bridge which leads into gateside is another tower where has been a drawbridge  sect v of the keyside above when i mentioned the sandhill i took notice that on the east it leads to the keyside which is a long wharf or key for ships and other vessels it is built upon the sand as indeed all the lower parts of the town have been through this street goes the remaining part of the townwall which is continued from the east end of the merchants court to sandgate gate which make in some manner two streets the inside and outside of the key on the top of this wall is a walk along it as is along the other walls of the town and at the bottom of it are a great many gates which are called watergates these in the reign of king james i anno      were ordered to be locked up every night except one or two to stand open for the masters and seamen to go to and fro to their ships this was done to prevent servants casting ashes and other rubbish into the river and those two gates were watched all night long  this key extends in length from east to west  0  rods  this street is chiefly inhabited by such as have their living by shipping such as merchants hostmen brewars etc as it is the great place of resort for the business of the coaltrade the grand support of this town and country and many other places also and likewise for many other things it is not much to be wondered at if in going along it you see almost nothing but a whole street of signposts of taverns alehouses coffeehouses etc  after you pass the customhouse where the kings customs are received which is at the west end of this street as you go along eastward you meet with a great many narrow chairs or lanes these have so many times changed their names and in all probability will so often do it that it is to little purpose at present to mention them there is however grundonchair which i meet with in a writing of several hundred years old as also the name of the broad chair of a very ancient standing and the name of another in a writing drawn in the reign of henry vi which had it been worth remembering would in all probability have been forgot long before now but which of the others went formerly by the names of brownchair the chair of nicholas de salicibus tods chair norham chair philips chair shipman chair oliver chair galway chair we are altogether in the dark there is one more ancient name of a chair in this street which is the kirkchair or the way or lane they generally went to church by from the keyside this i take to be that chair which now goes by the name of fenwicks entry because its situation answers so exactly to the churchyard the top of this chair being almost upon a line with the stairs that lead up to the church this lane is much the neatest of the whole street having in it several good houses which are kept in a different order from the generality of the house in those narrow lanes in the upper part of it is the dwelling house of cuthbert fenwick esquire alderman of this town who is the proprietor of the whole entry  at the key itself is a very safe station for ships where they lie free and secure from the greatest dangers of wind and water where they unload their wares and commodities their wood deal and by a crane their wines flax and all heavier commodities  chap xi of pandon or pampedon having done with what was anciently called newcastle we come now to describe the ancient town of pampedon which was a town of itself distinct from newcastle but was united to it in the reign of edward i vide anno      there is some doubt about the reason of the name some imagining it came from pandana one of the gates of rome which was so called quia semper paterit because it stood always open but i dare say this could never give name to the town of pandon which being in all probability a roman place of defense was rather obliged to be always shut others imagine it came from pandara a scottish virgin saint but for what reason they know best for my part i never saw one yet and perhaps for good reason for if i mistake not this town had the name of pandon before there ever was a saint in that kingdom i am therefore inclinable to believe that it got its name from the romans who lived in it who as gray agrees called it pampedon or pantheon because perhaps some building was erected here in this place in imitation of the pantheon at rome this wall being the utmost confines of the roman empire which was built in honor of all the gods and as this wall was the utmost bounds of the roman empire therefore there might be such a temple in this place to remind the romans of the necessary assistance of all the gods to preserve the bounds of the roman empire the late romans brit p     mr horsley will have the latter syllable of this word to come from the word deen which signifies a hollow or a brook because such is the place but with this i cannot agree the deen could not have that weight with it as to give name to the whole place or should that be allowed how is the former part of the name accounted for it retains therefore as gray justly observes its name without much alteration since the romans resided in it after the departure of the romans as the same authority gives out the kings of northumberland kept their residence in it and had their house now called pandonhall it was a safe bulwark having the picls wall on the northside and the river time on the south this place of pandon is of such antiquity that if a man would express an ancient thing it is a common proverb as old as pandon gate thus far this author  sect i of the manourchare but to treat of some particulars of this ancient town we shall begin then at the manourchare which leads from pilgrimstreet to st austin friars this chare which leads from pilgrimstreet to jesus hospital and from thence to the head of the broadchare was in ancient times called cowgate this is plain from an ancient writing in the possession of mr thomas waters in pilgrimstreet dated feb  0 in the  th year of edward the  th where are these words describing the situation of the house he possesses at present prout jacet in vico peregrinorum infra villam novicastri super tynam inter tenementum nuper laurentii de acton ex part boreali and tenementum nuper thomae clerk ex part australi and extendit in longitudine a via regia ante usque vicum quondam vocatum cowgate modo vocatum austynchare retro in the reign of edward the  th it had the name of austynchare as appears also from this writing now it has the name of manourchare which some imagine to be given from the word minor or minorites or franciscans but unless they can prove that the fryery of the franciscans was situated here they never can prove that the chare was so called from them and this is scarce possible to be done for we have already shown that the minorites or franciscans had their house in another part of the town viz in the highfryarchare this is also clearly proved from the several writings of the company of tailors that this place was formerly called cowgate and afterward called the frearchare or st austin frearchare these writings of theirs also mention an almshouse which went by the name of wards almshouse situated in this chare i supposed it was situated at the bottom of mr waters garden for i have heard some old people say they remember thereabouts the ruins of an almshouse  cowgate the ancient name of the street is still continued in one part of it viz from the foot of silverstreet to the head of the broadchare  having come down this lane from pilgrimstreet we come to three different ways that on the right leads down into pandon that on the front leads into the towns hospital and that on the left into st austinfryers and carliolcroft  sect ii of st austinfryers the left hand passage has still the remains of a large gate which has been one of the gates leading to st austinfryers which having past this gate is a little above upon the right hand there is still a complete quadrangle to be seen the south side of which has undoubtedly been the chapel this seems to have been the ancient building for gray seems to speak of some sumptuous additions that were made to it in succeeding ages says he it was enlarged and beautified with stately buildings cloisters and a fair church the kings of england since the conquest kept house in it whence they came with an army royal against scotland and since the suppression of monasteries made a magazine and storehouse for the north parts now of late that princely fabric is demolished and laid level with the ground the pride covetousness luxury and idolatry of these houses brought a sudden ruin upon themselves and houses  the same authority tells us also that there was an ancient religious house founded by the kings of northumberland and that several of them were buried here but it cannot be true that they built any thing for the st austin friars for they came not into england till long after the conquest in the year      then it was that lanfrank of milan the first general of the eremites of st austin sent some of them into england to seek a dwelling for themselves the augustine friars held their first house given them in wales at a place called woodhouse which before had belonged to the family of the noble family of the turburvills afterward humphry bohun earl of hereford and essex in the year of our lord      gave them a house and beautiful church remarkable for a spire of wonderful workmanship in london which is now partly a meeting house for the german protestants who have settled in london  anno      the augustine friars obtained leave to eat flesh upon condition that they should keep the fast of the friars minors before christmas stephen ad vol  d      what year this house was founded in or this order came to this house i have no where met with but the augustines are said to have been founded by the lord ross de rebus novocast the baron of werk which i am inclinable to believe very true for in the   th of edward the second      i find mention made of some lands in cowgate belonging to the brethren of st austin which were given them by william ross who was baron of werk how much earlier than this kings reign this monastery was founded i have not been able to learn but it is probable it was sometime in the reign of edward the  st and this i think is out of dispute now for since this conjecture of my own i received a letter from the rev mr wearing of bampton in westmoreland with the following account king edward the first in the   th year of his reign gave leave to one john de capella to give and assign a message of his in penrith to the prior and friars of the order of st augustine in the town of newcastle upon tyne  they surrendered on the  th of jan  0 hen    the enclosed ground all round it where is now the pasture of nathaniel clayton esquire alderman the surgeonshall the hospitals etc did undoubtedly belong to them and were their gardens  this house is now turned partly into a workhouse for the employment of the poor part of it is turned into a house of correction a dunghill etc here is the charityschool of the parish of all hallows which was built anno      and an house for the master to live in which was built the same year  the bells of all hallows were cast in this place which since the decay of the monastery was called the artilleryyard from the townsmens performing there the exercise of the pike and gun  before i have done with this monastery it may not be amiss to mention a passage in milbanks manuscript which came to my hands since the compiling of this antiquity the author of it says when i was young which was as i take it about the first of king james i reign there were cloisters in this monastery and a fair church a scot did beg it of king james after that took the lead off it and sold it but it was cast away before it came to its market he sold also some stones to sir peter riddel who with them built the southend of his fine house but now it belongs to captain dykes and his posterity has no right  sect iii of jesus hospital having thus done with what relates to the passage above mentioned on the left hand let us enter that on the front and this is what the people call the towns hospital but its true name is jesus hospital for it was dedicated to the holy jesus you ascend to it by stairs from the high street and then enter into a pleasing field on the northside of which is the said hospital it is three story high and the understory is adorned with piazzas which are about  0 yards in length and make a very agreeable walk about the middle of the piazzas is the entrance into the second and third stories and over against this entrance is a fountain very much beautified for the use of the hospital  this new hospital commonly called the towns hospital in the manours dedicated to the holy jesus was founded erected and endowed at the charge of this corporation anno      t robson mayor  for a master and thirty nine poor freemen or freemens widows  the town allows them quarterly  0 s and the master  0 s  toward the bottom of this field is another hospital erected for six poor widows of clergymen and merchants which was endowed by the charity of mrs anne davison widow of mr benjamin davison merchant and erected by the corporation of newcastle nathaniel clayton esquire mayor thomas wasse esquire sheriff anno       they have to subsist on  0 s per quarter each  sect iv of the barbersurgeons hall on the east of this same field is the hall of the barbersurgeons which was rebuilt by them in the year    0  it is a very beautiful one and not a little sumptuous it stands upon tall piazzas under which is a very spacious walk there is before it a fine square divided into four areas or grassplats surrounded with gravelwalks each of which is adorned with a statue the first of the two next the hall is the figure of aesculapius placed upon a tall pedestal upon one side of which is the motto  in the area oppposite to this is the figure of hippocrates who bears an open book with these words in it  and on the one side of the pedestal   these were set up in the year    0 john shaw and robert golightly stewards  on the other two grassplatts are the figures of medicus pergameus or galen and medicus spagyricus or paracelsus which were erected      robert golightly and william handby stewards i am informed by one of this company that in a little time the wall at the foot of the garden will be taken away and instead thereof will be ironrails it will show the hall and gardens to some advantage but be rather too great an ornament for such a dirty part of the town  there are besides this square two other gardens for herbs which together with the hall and garden we have been speaking of are attended by a gardner who lives there for that purpose  sect v of wards almshouse alveys island pandon hall we now turn to the right hand and descend the chair toward pandon and pass by mr waterss garden at the end of which was wards almshouse above mentioned of which i have lately met with the following account from the milbank manuscript the chief almshouse in the town is the wards near the manor the mills at pandongate should give them as i remember  0 s per annum to buy them coals but old mr brandling pulled off the lead on purpose to expel the poor people which he did the mills are now fallen into one homerss hand and so is lost for ever i have seen the writings and know it below this is a narrow passage which leads into the carliol croft below this again is a place which was formerly called the island as says tradition it was so called because in former times when the tide flowed up to the stockbridge there was thereabout a hill of sand which at the tides leaving of it appeared like an island they call it at present alveys island because it belonged to one of that name it is the very place on which stands the house cellars and malting of mr george hinkster which are bounded on the west north and south by the kings street and on the east by a waste piece of ground of the lady goldsburgh which was formerly called the stones  opposite to the south front of this house was the ancient building viz pandonhall above mentioned but now rebuilt in some measure there are still remaining many ancient walls and parts of this building it was of considerable bigness having been according to tradition on its northfront in length from the stockbridge to cowgate and on its westfront in length from its northwest corner beyond that lane that leads into blyths nook  it is of great antiquity being built in the times of the heptarchy for it was the house of the kings of northumberland who lived in it for which reason it was called pandonhall  sect vi of fishergate and wallknowl from hence we go eastward unto pandonbridge which is called the stockbridge it was undoubtedly of wood in ancient times though we meet with an account of its being stone when thomas de carliol was mayor which was in edward i time at latest to this place it was that the fishermen brought up their fish and sold them here as gray observes from tradition but to confirm this beyond the force of tradition it must certainly have been true that the fishmarket was here because the street you go into when you have past pandonbridge was formerly called fishergate now this is plain from an ancient writing which was drawn when henry le scot was mayor of this town about the year      i shall give my authority at large because there depends upon it some other things besides this  the writing is a conveyance of some land which is thus described  quae extendit in longitudine a communi via super le wallknoll in australem partem domus fratrum de monte carmel usque ad communem viam quae solebat ducere versus fishergate i e  which land extends itself from the street of the wallknoll to the south side of the monastery of the carmelites even to the highway which formerly led to fishergate  now it is certain this monastery was at the top of the wallknoll the remains of it are still in being and shall be by and by further considered it is also certain from this ancient writing that a way led from the south side of the said monastery to fishergate therefore this street must be fishergate because the common way here spoken of could lead to no other place i take this common way to have been those stairs beside mr greens house at the stockbridge which lead up to the gardens there and which were it not a wall would lead directly from this street to the remains of this monastery  as we go along from the stockbridge we meet two streets one on the left hand and the other on the right that on the left hand is called the wallknoll which as it is a very great ascent and high hill from fishergate so it seems to me to have this name from the roman wall going along it for the word knoll signifies an hill or eminence as i gather from the lord bishop of londons note in cambden upon sevenoke in kent who says on the east side of it stands knowll so called because it is seated upon a hill and gray says also positively that it was part of the picts wall  at the upper end of the street above mentioned toward the carpenters the following play coming too late to my hands to be inserted in its proper place i am obliged to mention it here it is entitled  noah s ark or the shipwrights ancient play or dirge deus incipitur ere was this world that i have wrought no marvel it is if i do show

in his will two fother of lead this hospital being dedicated to st michael gave the name to it of st michaels on the mount  it is said by dugdale in his baron lumley that the roger thornton he is there speaking of was the founder of the house of the white friars in newcastle but this roger can scarce be the founder of it for i have proved him to be the younger roger and it was taken notice of above that roger the elder left two fother of lead to it when he died so that if either of them be the founder it must be the elder rather than the younger that dugdale speaks of  but i believe it will be a difficult matter upon examination to prove either the father or the son the founder of it for it boasts a greater antiquity for this domus fratrum de monte carmel is mentioned in an ancient writing which was drawn when henry le scot was mayor about the year      in the reign of edward the  st as is said above and therefore it must at that time have been in being but the elder of them was not mayor of newcastle till     years after this so that it is impossible he should be the founder and therefore much less his son they might and probably they both of them were great benefactors or second founders to it and so have been esteemed each of them founders themselves  they surrendered at the same time with the rest sometime after they surrendered king henry the  th made a present of this priory and its revenues together with some other lands belonging to other religious houses lying in newcastle upon tyne to sir john gresham alderman of the city of london and richard billing ford gent who   st of february  d edward the  th conveyed them to william dent of this town gentleman what they conveyed was as follows  the house or priory of st michael de wall knoll with the things following belonging to it this orchard and garden were undoubtedly the gardens of swaddle green gray etc all that ground which descends into fishergate a garden and orchard about an acre of ground a close about   acres near the walls of the town    messuages three gardens and one close also a close called colerigges and four les rigges in the shield field also    more messuages in the town and suburbs belonging to the monastry of tinmouth also four tenements and a garden in this town belonging to the monastry of alnwick also three houses belonging to the nuns of halystone or holystone a village in northumberland where in the infancy of the english church paulinus is said to have baptized many thousands halystone also six houses in this town belonging to newminster also a house in this town belonging to the monastry of blanchland together with every thing belonging to the said monastries in this town of newcastle upon tyne  in the   th of queen elizabeth this william dent alderman and william his son conveyed this priory together with an house and orchard and a garden containing an acre of ground to william jenison then mayor of newcastle and richard hodgshon alderman  sect viii of crosswellgate bykerchare above when we went from fishergatestreet we met two streets that on the left hand we have already treated of the other i imagine is that which formerly went by the name of crosswellgate which is often mentioned in ancient writings it is reported that the dwelling house of roger thornton was in this street whatever truth is in this it is certain that many houses in this street pay an annual rent to the lord scarborough to this day into whose family the granddaughter of roger thornton was married there are in this street several lanes or allies the first we meet with in going along from fishergate is a place called at present blyths nook it is built over pandon burn the next is a narrow lane leading to the burn bank a place by which pandon burn runs into the tyne it lies very low and before the heightning of the ground with ballast and the building of the wall and key was often of great hazard to the inhabitants once in particular a most melancholy accident happened in this place in the year    0 the   th of edward the  d the river of tyne overflowed so much that   0 laymen and several priests besides women were drowned and as gray says   0 houses were destroyed complete hist eng vol  st p      beyond this again is a chare called byker chare which seems by the aged look of several of the buildings those especially at the northend of the chare where is the house of mr henry atkinson hoastman to be of great antiquity perhaps it got the name of bykerchare from one robert de byker and laderine his wife who had lands in pandon etc see anno       beyond this again is cocks chare lovelane etc where are some houses which deserve a better situation  sect ix cowgate trinityhouse broadchare when we came to pandonhall we went eastward into pandon it remains now that we go southward from the same place leaving then silverstreet on the right hand we come into cowgate which has been a part of the town where some eminent men have lived in such as gilbert de cowgate walter de cowgate etc who were men of fortune and estate going forward we pass by blythe nook on the left hand and the dogbank on the right and then we come to the broad chare a little below the entrance of which is the trinity house which according to some was a monastry dedicated to the holy trinity this order of the trinity house was founded by st john de matha and st john de valois in the year      in the popedom of innocent iii the end of its institution was the redemption of captives in the year      a monastry was founded for this order in kent what time this monastry of the trinity if there was such a one was founded in this town we are entirely in the dark only it was said by some that laurentius of newcastle was its founder if this be true it is not improbable but it was laurentius acton who was mayor of this town in      and      etc  we are also equally at a loss as to its situation for bishop burnet in his collection of records p     says it was on the wallknoll in newcastle and that they surrendered january  0th  0th of henry the  th if it was here i know of no place to fix it in but where the carmelites were and this could never be i am therefore inclinable to believe that this monastry means that of the carmelites and through a mistake is called that of the trinity  but be that as it will it is certain that this place called the trinity house was no religious house for it is said in our account below to have been called of old time daltons place and besides had it been this religious house the mariners could not have got possession of it till its suppression which was on the  0th of january  0th of henry the  th whereas it was conveyed to them the  0th of henry the  th as the following account testifies  a writing in the custody of the brethren of the trinityhouse dated the  th day of january the  0th of the reign of henry the  th which gives an account of a message and garden which was conveyed by one ralph hebborne of hebborne of northumberland esquire to the fraternity of the mariners it is the place where is now the trinity house which was in old time called daltons place  in the same writing it is ordered that the aforesaid message etc shall be repaired for ever by the common purse of the brotherhood that in some convenient part of it should be an hall for the fellowship to meet in at all times convenient for the observing of their rules etc and that in the residue of the same there should be certain lodgings ordered for such of the said fellowship as afterward should fall into poverty or be not able to sustain themselves those they held during the term of their lives and then were succeeded by others in the like necessitous circumstances it was also ordered in this writing that within the said message there should be a chapel and a priest to sing and say mass and other divine service therein as should be appointed by the aldermen and wardens of the said fraternity for the time being that the priest and the said poor persons so admitted should pray for the good estate of the said ralph hebborne master john hebborne george hebborne and for the masters souls and for the good estate of the said fellowship and for the souls of such of the same fellowship as be departed or hereafter should depart to the mercy of god and also for the souls of john dalton sometime owner of the said message his ancestors souls and all christian souls  one part of this writing was to be put in a chest belonging to the fellowship and kept by them the other was to be kept in a chest for that purpose in the vestry of allhallows in this town in the custody of the churchwardens for the time being for ever  this was further confirmed to the fraternity of the trinity house by thomas hebborne son of the said ralph hebborne on the  th of september in the   th of the reign of king henry the  th upon the conditions following viz that the fellowship should pay to the said thomas hebborne his heirs or assigns within the town of newcastle on the vigil of the apostles peter and paul in the month of june a pottle of wine if it be demanded yearly for evermore that the said thomas hebborne should be made a brother of the fraternity and partaker of all masses good prayers and suffrage which should afterward be celebrated said and done by the chaplain and priest of the fraternity within the trinity house and at the trinity altar within the church of allhallows for evermore with such obsequies and funeral ceremonies as usually were done at the burial of any brother of the same fraternity if the said thomas departs within this town of newcastle the priest of the trinity house at this time was one sir robert ellison  to this writing was annexed the seal of the town of newcastle and the names of the mayor sheriff and aldermen  on oct the  th    hen   lighthouses were permitted to be built by the trinityhouse to found edify make and build two towers that is to say one on the north part of shields in the entrance of the harbor and another upon the hill king james the  st in the third year of his reign granted to the master pylots and seamen of newcastle a charter  seventeenth of october      king charles the  d granted them another charter  and a third was granted them   th of july      by king james the  d  in a manuscript i have frequently mentioned it is said that the trinity house in the broad chare was held by the masters and mariners of this town of the andersons by giving them a red rose at christmas which bartram anderson turned to wine and then sold it to sir ralph jenison and it adds how they agree i know not it is at present a very pretty building consisting of a handsome square very monastic in it is aspect having it is appartments or lodgings for the inhabitants a very neat chapel and a magnificent hall it maintains    persons allowing every one a chamber eight shillings per month coals and clothing there are also    extra persons which have allowed them some more some less  leaving this house of the mariners we go down the broad chare without any thing remarkable till you come to the keyside about the middle of it is a square which goes by the name of stonyhill nigh it a lane called spicerlane which also leads on to the key  chap xii of the suburbs and other out places sect i of the forth without the closegate is a pretty long street with houses on each side which goes as far as a dike called skinnerbourne where are of late years a factory belonging to mr thomlinson a pothouse to mr joseph blenkinsop and ralph harl and a glasshouse to mr dagney and company from thence northward at the top of the hill is the place called the forth anciently called the frith which lies without the walls of the town and abutts on the south on a certain little close called goosegreenclose then it extends itself to a close called dovecoteclose and from thence westward by the furthest ditch of the close which lies contiguous to the corner of the hedge which is next to the common way which leads into the forth then by and over the common way to the little rivulet or syke of water in the bottom of the valley and so passing the syke you go upwards to the close called goosegreenclose the forth contains    acres of ground it was surveyed by order of the parliament in the year      and valued at    l per annum  it was valued tythefree the town paid   l per annum to the king for it  how it comes to be called forth or frith i can only conjecture the word blount law dictionary in verb frith forth or frith as it is anciently called comes from the saxon word frith which signifies peace for the english saxons held several woods to be sacred and made them sanctuaries from this definition of the word it may be no improbable conjecture that the ancient saxons inhabiting about the parts of the wall where the town now is gave the name of frith to this place as it was perhaps endowed with gloomier shades and darker recesses the awful excitors of heathen superstition than other places about the town were  in the reign of king henry iii a license was granted to the townsmen of newcastle bearing date dec   d of his reign to dig coals and stones etc in this place called the forth and here it was as some think or rather as others in the castle leases that the first newcastle coals were wrought  it seems to have been all along a place of pleasure and recreation for it was an ancient custom for the mayor aldermen and sheriff of this town accompanied with great numbers of the burgesses to go every year at the feasts of easter and whitsuntide to the forth with the maces sword and cap of maintenance carried before them undoubtedly the vast concourse of both young and old at this place at these seasons of the year rather than at any other about this town is the remains of this ancient custom  after the building of the castle it is said but without any just authority that the forth was anciently a fort belonging to the castle  in the year  part of it was turned into a pretty large bowlinggreen which was adorned with a broad gravel walk and a double row of trees around it it is at present a mighty pretty place exceeding by much any common place of pleasure about the town on the east side of it you have a prospect of part of the towns wall through which is the common passage to and from this place under a shady walk of trees on the west you view the grounds of the village of elswick which have a gentle ascent to the village itself a place at the proper season of the year much frequented by the towns people for its pleasing walk and rural entertainment  from this quarter we view also as we do from the south the banks of the river tyne together with their villages on the north is an house of accommodation  gray says that it was given to the townsmen for their services by edward iii whereas it seems to have been theirs in the reign of hen iii however if the other conjecture be true i verily believe it was given to the town for that memorable victory obtained by the townsmen when the earl of murray was taken prisoner which is commemorated in anno christi       sect ii of wardenclose from hence we proceed to the westgate which gives name to a little village within the bounds of the county of northumberland from whence still going on by the outside of the towns wall we come to the wardensclose it seems to be called the wardensclose because it belonged to the wardens of the priory of tinmouth for gray tells us he had his house garden and fish pond etc here this indeed is not improbable for the monastery of the blackfriars was dependant upon the priory of tinmouth and we are sure that this close was part of the garden belonging to the blackfriars in former times and there are still the seeming remains of fish ponds gardens etc  at the top of this field toward the north is a field called the shoulder of mutton close because it is in the shape of a shoulder of mutton which must formerly have been part of the wardensclose in this is a cistern of water which a curious friend of mine imagines supplied the blackfriars this perhaps may be true enough the well belonging to this monastry may proceed from it but i take its grand use to have been to supply with water the fish ponds and gardens just now mentioned  sect iii of newgate suburbs the suburbs out of newgate gray informs us were ruined in the late civil wars however the street gallowgate so called because of the way that the malefactors of the town of newcastle go to the gallows which is situated in a very low place called the gallowshole is become again a very tolerable street and a very pleasant place having in it some good houses which are situated in gardens and fields at the top of this street is a lane which leads to the westgate quarryhouse etc it borders upon a field called the shoulder of mutton close  sect iv of the castle leases town moor etc opposite to this lane is the castle leases called anciently the castle field a large piece of ground belonging to the town containing     acres    perches gray informs us that tradition said it was the gift of king john to the good men of newcastle however this be it is certain that it had been the towns immemorially or time out of mind in the reign of king edward iii for in the   st of that reign the town of newcastle took an inquisition in the castle field on a palm sunday eve the   st year of king edward iii desiring the confirmation of the castle moor and field and the privileges belonging to them and the king by his letters patents dated at westminster confirmed to the burgesses of newcastle the other charters they had obtained and also confirmed to them the possession of the castle moor concessimus pro nobis and heredibus nostris quod predicti burgenses and eorum heredes habeant and teneant moram and terras predictas  lib cart p      and castle field they having belonged to this town immemorially at this time he also as appears by the said charters confirmed to the burgesses of this town and their heirs the liberty of digging coals stone and all other advantages arising from the said castle moor  this place was formerly the inheritance of diverse persons owners thereof who were accustomed from ancient time to take the fore crop thereof yearly at or before lammasday and after that by an ancient custom all the burgesses of this town used to put in their kine and used the same in pasturing of them till lady day in lent yearly and then to lay the same for meadow again till lammas  in the year      when george morton was mayor the town purchased the sweepage of the castle leases for the benefit of the burgesses  in the   d of charles ii a license was granted the mayor and burgesses to purchase the sweepage of the castle leases  the grounds of it abut on the said castle moor on the east and north parts upon the highway leading to kenton on the west and on the other way leading to the said castle moor on the south  when the parliament took an inquisition of it the forth and town moor in the year    were valued at    l per annum  the mill in the castle leases commonly called chimley mill upon the syke or rivulet called bailiffburn and the other mill called little mill were at the same time valued at  0 l per annum each  this ground was always valued tythefree  on the west and north of the castle leases lies the townmoor it is a very spacious piece of ground containing  0   acres one rood two perches it was originally a wood very famous for oak trees out of which have been built many hundred of ships and all the houses of the old town of newcastle  this moor together with the castle leases or castle lizards called anciently the castle moor and castle field were the right of the town of newcastle and had been so time out of mind as has been just now observed in the reign of king edward iii who in his charter of the town dated the tenth of may in the   st year of his reign confirmed the holding and possessing of it and the working of coals stones etc in it together with all the profits arising from it in the same manner he had confirmed all the immunities and privileges which had been granted by the kings his predecessors to the burgesses of newcastle  the ancient bounds of the townmoor which are the same to this day and answer still in every particular are thus described in the charter abovementioned  et quia ex part dilectorum nobis burgensium ejusdem villae nobis est supplicatum ut cum mora and terra vocatae castlefield and castlemoor ex part boreali dictae villae novicastri de quadam placea vocata inglesdick versus orientem per metas positas usque ad quandam placeam vocatam le thornbusk juxta crucem and deinde per certas divisas and metas positas versus dictam villam novicastri usque furcas and sit inter postos furcarum ita quod una postis fiat in marchia inter terram prioris de tynemouth and terram dictae villae novicastri and sit usque le quarldike and deinde per viam usque ad candem villam novicastri sunt terra and solum dictae villae novicastri pertinentia ad eandem villam a tempore quo non extat memoria  the substance of which is it bounders on a certain street or causeway called ginglerdyke and bounders to a street or causeway called thornbusk besides the cross and from thence to the bounders set toward the town of newcastle unto a gallows set between the trees or posts of the gallhouse so that one post is placed and set in the marches between the fields and lands of the prior of tinmouth and the fields and grounds of newcastle and so extends unto the quarreldyke and from thence unto the kingsstreet and so on unto the said village  it is the opinion of gray some that this large piece of ground was the gift of adam de athol of gesmond to the town but if the town of newcastle had an immemorial right to the townmoor in the days of edward iii and this is proved from his charter abovementioned then it is very improbable that adamarus de athol of gesmunde should be the donor of it for this de reb novicast p   adam was high sheriff of the county of northumberland in the fifth of richard ii and was living in the year of our lord      as appears by an indulgence of  0 days granted to the church of st andrews which was in the proceedings upon a dispute about  0 years after relating to the townmoor it is declared that the townmoor had belonged to the town of newcastle immemorially or time out of mind but how can it be said to be in the possession of the town for so long a time when he himself who gave it lived thirty years after this declaration and if he did so no doubt but several others lived so long too either then the town was not at the time of this dispute immemorially in the possession of this ground or this adamarus de athol was not the donor of it again had he been the donor of it he must have been   0 years old at his death that is to say he lived thirty years after this dispute and ninety before to make it immemorial which is the least time that can be allowed to make any thing so so that these two put together will make that number of years at his death it is not indeed in this age of the world impossible for a man to live so long but yet it is highly improbable there are few come to this age and when they do they are looked upon as so many great exceptions to the general rule of the ages of men and then their ages stand upon record to succceeding generations and no doubt had this been true of adam de athol it would at least have been mentioned upon his tombstone but we find no such thing nay should we allow for the sake of making him the donor that he really lived   0 years yet after all this grand absurdity would follow that if the town when this dispute happened had had it immemorially he must have made a present of it on the very day he was born  for these reasons therefore it is impossible he should be the donor of it but some of his ancestors of the same name might and this is the rather to be imagined because tradition says it was adam de athol of jesumund handing down the name to this day as then he was of the same name and undoubtedly a great benefactor to this town so the good deeds of some of his ancestors might have been ascribed to him through mistake and so be handed down to this present day there was one adam de jesumuthia or gesmund who ordered that one goodplank or sixshillings should be given annually as may be seen in the account of the tynebridge for the reparation of the bridge perhaps it was him for the bridge was burnt in the reign of henry iii in the year      and immediately they set about the repair of it and this adam was one of the benefactors to it if then tradition says true that adam de jesmund was the donor of the townmoor to the town this is probably the very man and whether he gave it before the burning of the bridge or at the time of his benefaction to the bridge yet in the thirty first of edward iii it would undoubtedly have been the towns immemorially which is a good presumptive proof of this conjuncture that this was the very man be this as it will it is certain that it had been the town of newcastles time out of mind in the thirty first year of edward iii and was then confirmed to them as has been observed above in our account of the castle leases  two fairs are kept upon this moor on the first of august and eighteenth of october of which the tolls booths stallage pickage and courts of picpowder to each of the fairs were reckoned worth communibus annis    l in olivers time  in the survey made of the townmoor in the troublesome times it was reported that the coal mine or colliery in the townmoor extended it self under the superficies of the townmoor one hundred acres and that the value of it was to the town    l per annum  it is the pasture for the cows belonging to the freemen of newcastle  it is much frequented by the gentry of this town and others for exercise and health it being that part of it especially called the cowhill a place of the most wholesome air about the town  of the nunmoor the nunmoor is that large piece of ground that lies on the west of the townmoor between the thornbush and the hedge that separates from it the grounds of kenton  richard i confirmed to st marys and the nuns of newcastle whatsoever had been given them by asalack the founder of that hospital as is observable in his charter of the founding of st marys whatever belonged to him as well in land as in money or houses whatever he had acquired and obtained both within and without the town of newcastle all these he confirmed and he himself also gave them two carucates of land of his own that they might pray for his soul this is supposed to be the charter for the confirmation of nunfield or as it seems to have been otherwise called nunhouse in the townmoor and if this conjecture be true it is clear that this asalack gave the nunmoor to the nuns of st bartholomew and not as is commonly reported adam de athol these nuns were the occasion of it is being entitled nunfield or nunhouse or the nunmoor as it is called at this day  in the fourth of the reign of henry vii dame joan prioress of the monastry of st bartholomew the apostle in newcastle upon tyne and convent of the same granted a lease of the nunmoor for an hundred years to the mayor sheriff aldermen and commonality of this town under the yearly rent of one pound three shillings and four pence hence it is plain that this moor belonged to those nuns and took it is name from them  in the eleventh of henry viii there was an award between the said priory and convent and william bennet esquire owner of kenton about the bounders of it  in the thirty sixth of the same reign it was granted to john broxholm in consideration of      l    s   d and was conveyed by those claiming under him to the mayor and burgesses of newcastle upon tyne  thirty seventh hen viii upon an inquisition then taken and returned into the exchequer of lands belonging to religious houses nunmoor is certified to be within the county of northumberland  the other parts of the suburbs out of newgate is a street that reaches as far as the barrasbridge called sidgate which consists of houses very indifferent most of which are inhabited by poor people but very sweetly situated having the leases or gardens behind them  sect v of the suburbs of pilgrimstreet we come now to the suburbs of pilgrimstreet gate which were also ruinated in the late civil wars but at present it is a very well built street having in it some very pretty houses such as are the houses of mr john stephenson merchant mr john morris hoastman and several belonging to mr william graham etc  this street is the most pleasant situation of any within or without the town  it stands as it were in the middle of gardens and shady fields which make it a delicious place in the summer season  in the upper part of it nigh the barrasbridge are to be seen the remains of the hospital dedicated to st mary magdalen which was vulgarly called the maidleins it was seated at the summit of an hill beneath which is the well called st mary magdalens well so named from the hospital as are also several fields which to this day are called the maidlin meadows  it was founded by king henry i for a master brethren and sisters to receive leprous folks and since that sickness abated for the poor of the town in time of pestilence fourteen within the house were allowed every one a room   s per month coals and fifteen without some   s per month some   s some   s   d  one johannes de bland obiit die mensis proximo ante festum sancti michaelis archangeli hora nona illius diei anno domini millesimo tricentesimo septuagesimo quarto cujus corpus humatum est juxta summum altere ex part boreali cancellarii in capella beatae mariae magdalenae lib cart john bland was the master of this hospital in the reign of edward iii he was a man of a fair character and good reputation it is recorded of him that he died the day before the feast of st michael the archangel or on the   th of september in the ninth hour of that day in the year of our lord      his body was buried nigh the highaltar on the north side of the chancel in st mary magdalens chapel  he was a great benefactor to this hospital as appears from his charity and generosity in the first year of his mastership for whereas laurentius acton had the said hospital in perpetuum for himself his heirs and assigns this worthy man paid for his own right  0 marks to the said laurentius and the said laurentius had the first fruits belonging to the said hospital which yearly amounted to the sum of  00 marks  one richard sperman had an annual pension from the said hospital of   marks which pension the abovementioned gentleman in the  d year of his mastership bought out for the said hospital  he also the same year freed the said hospital from an annual pension which was payable to hugo de mitford  the same master of this hospital in this same year following built in the said hospital a consistory a stable and a bier and made in the quire two new windows facing the south of the said chapel besides a number of other good and generous charities which he bestowed upon this hospital  the same gentleman proves judicially in the kings court that the mayor and commonalty of newcastle upon tine did assign present and induct the master of the said hospital he was master of the said hospital about five years  in the reign of our lord      in the  th of queen elizabeth one edmund wiseman servant to the right honorable sir nicholas bacon knight and keeper of the great seal of england obtained by the procurement of one cuthbert bewick a burgess and merchant of this town of newcastle a presentation from the queen of the hospital of st mary magdalen lying without the wall of newcastle of which hospital the mayor and burgesses of this town were the true and very patrons and had till then presented time out of the westspittle the hospital called the magdalens and the chapel of st thomas the martyr have been given by the mayor and burgesses of newcastle time out of mind mind by virtue of this presentation from the queen james bishop of durham would have inducted the said wiseman in the year aforesaid betwixt lammas and martinmas into the possession of the said hospital but the mayor and aldermen of the town having respect to the defense of their patronage would in no wise permit the said bishop to give induction therein for the hospital of st mary magdalen was a donative and not a benefice inductible by any bishop  in the year        th february the mayor and burgesses of newcastle granted the next presentation of st mary magdalen commonly called the maidenes to henry anderson robert mitford and christopher mitford  in the account of fickettower there is mention made of a great cross standing within maudlinbarras and in the milbank manuscript it is said at the end of the barras bridge before the chapel stood a stately cross firm and complete and this pigg was a rebel a very great enthusiast a monument of his whimsical head is that stonepillar a little north of the three mile bridge which every deservedly to this day bears the title of pigs folly john pigg in the time of the rebellion took it down and called it idolatry and thought to make his own use of it but it was broke by some who hated it should be profaned this hospital at the suppression was valued at   l    s   d  leaving st mary magdalens we go forward to the end of this street which together with the end of the street leading from newgate meets at the barrasbridge  how it comes by the name of barrasbridge gray gives us no account others have imagined it to be so called from a person of that name who was its builder or benefactor this conjecture in my opinion is a grand mistake for we have just now mentioned the maudlinbarras and therefore the word barras must imply something else the manuscript above mentioned speaking of the antiquity of st andrews church gives this as a reason of its being the oldest in town because it is next the barras which has been the ancient barracado of the town so then according to this account it got its name from the word barracado this also in my opinion is a mistake for the word barrows for so it should be spelled signifies the same as tinnuli hillocks and sometimes graves and sepulchers and when it is considered that the hospital of st mary magdalen was founded for the reception of leprous folks it is easy to see that the maudlinborrows are the tombs or burialplaces of those that died of the leprosy in that hospital and since the burialplace it self was nigh to the bridge the bridge got thence the name of the barrowsbridge the barras mentioned in the account of fickettower are the same thing nothing else but the burialplace of the franciscan friars  the place of the maudlin barrows i take to be the sick mans close for as after the abating of the leprosy this hospital was obliged to take the poor of the town in during the time of the pestilence so i question not but those that died were buried in the ancient burialplace or barrows of the hospital and since we are certain they were buried in the sick mans close we may be therefore almost certain that the sick mans close was the barrows of this hospital  the barrowsmill belonged to the black friars and in the year      paid a rent to the town of newcastle of   s per annum lib cart p     the chapel on the other side the barrowsbridge was dedicated to st james the apostle and was anciently called st see andrew tower jamess kirk i suppose it was a chapel of ease to st andrew for jesmond and sandiford and other outparts of that parish  sect vi of the suburbs of pandon the suburbs out of pandongate are but very few houses but there are gardens all the way up the causeway two of them are those of mr john simpson and mr charles atkinson this way was within these four years the pleasantest entrance into the town of newcastle having gardens on each side beset with trees of so large a size and shade that they covered the street itself in several places these were cut down for a little unpossest money and the greatest beauty of the street lost  there are in this street two or three passages leading to different places which it may not be amiss to mention after you are out of pandongate there is one on the left hand leading to pandondean a very romantic place full of hills and vales through which runs pandonburn it is a very entertaining walk in the summer to magdalenwell a little above this is another very narrow passage on the right hand bordering upon mr harrisons garden which leads to a place called the garthheads which was a place of pleasure and recreation but of late it was taken in and made a common garden of by richard ridley esquire the proprietor of it  having past this lane we proceed till we come to the top of this great ascent for such indeed is this street and there we meet with two ways the one leads to the shieldfield the property of mr charles clark of newcastle which has been already mentioned and the other to owseburn which is at present a large village occasioned by the coalworks of richard ridley and matthew white esqs etc  it takes its name from the burn that runs through it the banks of this burn are in many places terribly high in all places beautifully romantic  before we come to the suburbs of sandgate we must not omit to mention the keelmens hospital it is situated some distance east of the towns wall between the carpenters tower and sandgate it is a square building done in the form of monasteries and colleges having its low walk round it in imitation of cloisters the area in the middle of it is about    foot broad and about    foot long there are upwards of fifty chambers in it who it was built by may be learned from the inscription above the entrance of it which is as follows the keelmens hospital built at their own charge anno domini   0  matthew white esquire governor mr edward gray mr edward carr stewards of the hoastmens company for the time being and trustees for this hospital i have been told that dr moor one of the late bishops of ely upon going down the river in the towns barge with the magistrates observed it and made enquiry after it and being told that it was built by the keelmen themselves every one allowing toward it a penny a tide he said that he had heard of and seen many hospitals the works of rich men but that was the first he ever saw or heard of which had been built by the poor it is a great pity that the design of its building is not thoroughly answered but there are some miscreants who would rather starve in sickness or old age than not guzzle a penny in their health and youth  sect vi of the suburbs of sandgate the suburbs of sandgate excepting some houses nigh the walls of the town we are informed escaped the fury of the civil wars this street has it is name from it is situation which is upon the sand for this whole street as well as the sandhill and all the lower parts of the town in ancient times was the common sand or shore of the river  this street has in it a vast number of narrow lanes on each side of it which are crowded with houses it is chiefly inhabited by people that work upon the water particularly the keelmen the number of souls in this street and the lanes belonging to it is computed to several thousands  about the middle of this street is an open place called the squirrel from a little brook of that name which runs through it into the river tyne which was the ancient bounds of the town of newcastle from this as far as the house of mr jeremiah cook shipwright is the street of sandgate then we enter st anns street so called from the neighboring chapel which leads us on to the ropery which is a long and pleasant walk giving an agreeable prospect of the river and a great part of the town and neighboring places what this ropery was formerly gray gives us the best account below east says he is the ballasthill where women upon their heads carried ballast which was taken forth of the small ships which came empty for coals which place was the first ballast shore out of the town since which time the trade increasing there are many ballast shores below the water on both sides of the river much the same account is given of this in the manuscript so frequently mentioned the hoastmen got leave at first to lead coals above the bourn and that occasioned their delivery of ballast upon the limekiln road and the women bore the ballast upon their heads and made the ballasthills for the town had procured all that shore of the lords of byker for that use and to build limekilns upon  on the north of this ropery stands the chapel of st ann which is a a chapel of east to the church of allhallows which though pretty large is yet much too little for the parish it being perhaps one of the largest parishes in the whole kingdom  when it was originally built i have met with nothing that gives any account after the reformation it was neglected and came into decay but the town in the year      repaired it and settled a lecturer there to preach in the morning and to expound the catechism every sunday afternoon which the town allowed  0 l per annum for at the opening of it after it was repaired the rev mr march then vicar of the town preached the first sermon in it which was printed and entitled the encaenia of st ann s chapel in sandgate  it has at present two lecturers which are paid by the town the rev mr clayton and the rev mr maddison to the former the town pays  0 l per annum and to the latter  0 l  below this to the glasshousebridge are the houses of shipwrights and master builders such as mr thomas wallas mr roger durham mr john lattany mr cuthbert preston etc  the glasshousebridge so called because of the glasshouses which are almost contiguous to it was originally a woodbridge as the bridge higher up the bourn was till within these   or   years but in the year      when ralph jenison esquire was mayor it was made of stone by thomas wrangham shipwright on account of lands which the town let him the passage however over it was very difficult and uneven till the year      when stephen coulson esquire was mayor it was made level and commodious both for horse and foot  on the other side of the bridge are the glasshouses which in greys time served most part of the kingdom with windowglass  sometime in the reign of queen elizabeth came over to england from lorrain the henzels tyzacks and tytorys the reason of their coming hither was the persecution of the protestants in their own country of whose persuasion they were they were by occupation glassmakers at their first coming to this town they wrought in their trade at the closegate after that they removed into staffordshire from whence they removed again and settled upon the river side at the place called from their abiding in it the glasshouses deservedly therefore have so many of these families been named peregrines from the latin word peregrinus which signifies a pilgrim or a stranger  having at last settled here they became very numerous and generally married into each others families to preserve the three names of henzel tyzack and tytory but the latter of them within this few years became extinct there are of the tyzacks several remaining but the henzels are most numerous  as you go from the glasshouse you come now to the glasshouses a large village and pass by the western glasshouse then to the crownglasshouse then to the middle bottlehouse then to the middle broadhouse then to the castern glasshouse nigh this last is the house of the late mr peregrine henzel the principal person then remaining of his family and one of the chief owners of these works  from hence we pass over the grounds of st laurence to a place consisting of several houses which from a chapel here situated dedicated to st laurence is called st laurences glasshouse or mushroomglasshouse there is also here a bottle glasshouse now held under the town by mrs middleton of which richard ridley esquire is an owner  st laurences chapel or chantery as it is called is said to have been built by one of the earls of northumberland no doubt that prayers might be put up for his soul and the souls of his family  at the reformation it had fate of many chapels of the like kind to have its revenues disposed of and itself left to fall into ruins  it was dependant upon the priory of st johns of jerusalem it was granted to the town in the  d of edward vi among other things in consideration of     l    s   d  anno dom      the rents of st laurence as follow l s d st laurente taken by lease by john laverock    0 00 the fishery of st laurence taken by

st laurence lib cart     nigh this chapel of st laurence is one of the wagon ways and steaths of richard ridley esquire for his colliery at byker  one of the andersons procured a shore from the chapel of st laurence unto the gate that runs down the river toward lawsons land which was filled by womens heads milbank  sect viii of the towns bounders the town bounders by land from a small brook or course of water called the swerle in time past in the county of northumberland and now in the town of newcastle on the west side of the aforesaid town along by the shore of the water of tyne unto the fields of the town of elswick in the aforesaid county of northumberland by and along the fields of the town of elswick aforesaid unto the fields of the town of fenham was heretofore a village very pleasant and beautiful on account of it is much wood but now much more so because of the very fine house and gardens of thomas ord esquire this village or the royalty of it belonged to the priory of st john of jerusalem for we meet with a receipt from the prior to the town of newcastle for the coal mines of fenham fenham in the aforesaid county of northumberland and so toward the north unto the fields of the town of kenton in the aforesaid county of northumberland and along by those fields unto the town of the estate of william carr esquire coxlodge in the aforesaid county of northumberland and so toward the east of the fields of the town of jesmund in the aforesaid county and by and along the same fields of jesmund toward the south unto a certain bridge called barrasbridge in the aforesaid county of newcastle upon tyne and from the same bridge in and through a certain lane in the aforesaid county of northumberland and newcastle leading toward the east to another bridge called sandiver bridge in the aforesaid county of northumberland and from the same bridge toward the south in and through a certain field called shieldfield in the aforesaid county of northumberland and newcastle unto a certain lane or street in the same county leading to the aforesaid water or river of tyne  the additional bounders are mentioned in the second and third years of king edward vi  the circumference of the towns bounders is  0 miles and  0 yards  chap xiii of the river tyne it remains now that we speak of the river the tyne seems to have been originally as to the name of it vedra for the river vedra is the only river taken notice of by ptolomy in these parts and we all know that in these parts the river tyne is the most considerable  there is indeed a tyne mentioned by ptolomy but that is situated between the tay and forth in scotland but neither can that be it it is too inconsiderable nor lastly can it be the river were though there is a nigher affinity in sound between vedra and were than between vedra and tyne for the vedra is mentioned by ptolomy as the most considerable river and it is confessed that the tyne is more so than the were or if the were has any claim to the name of vedra it is only in conjunction with the river tyne perhaps says mr horsley p  0  vedra has been the name of the tyne and were the tract that now has between the two rivers and is bounded on each side by them is now called werewickshire   tyne which is indeed a river to be outdone by few in the whole kingdom whether you respect it is haven it is commodities it is privileges which have been frequently mentioned the prospect of it is fields it is woods and villages etc as to the haven it is so deep as to carry vessels of a considerable burden and of that security that they are not in danger either of storms or shallows save that within a little of the bar of tinmouth which are called by the sailors the blackmiddens which are very dangerous but to prevent any mischiefs which may happen to ships in the night time from them there are two lighthouses maintained by the trinityhouse in newcastle and near them in the year      was built a fort called cliffords fort which effectually commands all the vessels that enter the river mag brit vol   p  0   mr cambden observes that this town of newcastle for it is situation and plenty of seacoal so useful in itself and to which so great a part of england and the low countries are indebted for their good fires is thus commended by johnson in his poems on the cities of britain  novum castrum rupe sedens celsa rerum aut

more than heaven can show it is observable in this place when the coal trade is brisk that all other business is so too and when it is otherwise through the contracts of the coal owners or of the masters that there is a certain deadness in all trafick it is the money arising from the coal trade that almost entirely circulates in this great town and adjacent country  it has been observed by fleetwood preciosum chronicon     p some that sea coal has not been in use above   0 years at least not in london and that when we meet with coals in old accounts it is meant of charcoal i can scarce be of this opinion if it was but for what the said authority himself acknowledges viz that carbo marinus or sea coal is mentioned in matthew paris and in the  st of edward iii there is mention made de carbonibus marithnis of sea coals and the measure of them  however this be nigh this town of newcastle coals were worked very early in a charter of king hen iii dated dec     d of that kings reign license was granted to the town of newcastle to dig coals in the castlefield and the frith  in the year      the  th of hen v twopence per chaldron being paid to the king for all coals sold at the port of newcastle to people not enfranchised it was enacted that the keels should be of the burden of  0 chaldrons and no more according to custom some being of the burden of    and some of    chaldrons built to defraud the king of his customs and that the keels should be sealed by the kings officers de reb     queen elizabeth demanding of the town the arrear of   d per chaldron which had been neglected for many years the town begged her majesty that these arrears might be forgiven and to grant them a gardner queen eliz charter charter to incorporate a new fraternity or brotherhood to be called free hoastmen for the selling and vending of all coals to shipping and in consideration thereof they would pay to her majesty and her successors    d for every chaldron exported from thenceforth to the free people of this nation this was taken into consideration and granted  in the year      in the time of the civil war the city of london received a great advantage by this towns being taken for almost two years bypast the poorer sort of people had been almost starved coals having risen to the price of   l per chaldron a price never known before that time  this place is generally computed to vend upwards of  00000 chaldrons a year there are likewise vast exportations of lead salt salmon and grindstones which last commodity as gray says and is still true are conveyed to most parts of the world according to the proverb a scott a rat and a newcastle grindstone you may find all the world over  it is not in my power to describe the number of arts and curious machineries that are used in this affair of the coal business the sinking of pits winning of coals fireengines waggonways the wagons their managing of them the staiths etc deserve a more skilful pen thus much however i may venture to say that those waggonways a small part of the whole coal works may vie with some of the great works of the roman empire  the right and title of the mayor and burgesses of the town and county of the town of newcastle upon tyne to the soil and also to the conservation of the river of tyne  st by prescription  the said mayor and burgesses have time out of mind enjoyed the soil of the said river or tyne and all shores or keys built upon the said river are by virtue of leases from the said mayor and burgesses  and they the said mayor and burgesses have also time out of mind enjoyed the conservation of the said river of tyne  and for conservation and preservation thereof there has also time out of mind been holden before the mayor and aldermen of the said town every monday a court in which court enquiry is made after the due conservation and preservation of the said river of tyne by a jury sworn to present all nusances done therein who make presentiments thereof in writing whereupon the offenders are summoned and if guilty are punished by fine or imprisonment  but formerly there has been another custom for punishing such offenders as appears by the following testimonial  a testimonial of john philipss and william goodwins cutting each a purse in the towns chamber for casting ballast in the river of tyne villa novicastri super tynam whereas information upon oath was given that john philips master of the mary of hull and william goodwin master of the elizabeth of wisebidge did the  th of this instant cast ballast within the    fathom deep between sowter and hartley to the damage of the river they the said persons being called before us the mayor aldermen and chamberlains with the master of the trinityhouse who was then present in the town chamber and did there acknowledge and confess the said offense and did lay down   l a piece which was put into two purses which they cut according to the ancient custom of this corporation in such cases  henry dawson mayor leonard carr robert shafto thomas ledgard thomas bonner william dawson george dawson ralph fell master of the trinityhouse phineas allin chamberlains thomas welsh thomas young christopher ellison thomas goftyn   this ancient custom of cutting a purse etc was confirmed anno      by an order of the king and council  they the said mayor and burgesses have also time out of mind had a water bailiff who is a sworn officer and other officers whose offices are to search out offenses done in and upon the said river of tyne and to execute the orders of the said court  and they the said mayor and burgesses have also always cleansed the port from rubbish ballast and sand either brought in by storms or otherwise into the said river of tyne  the trinityhouse of this town which is a fraternity of mariners free of the said town are also frequently employed in discovering offenses done to the said river of tyne and where there are dangerous places in the said river buoys and lights are set and persons employed and paid by the said trinityhouse for looking to and taking care of them   dly by acts of parliament  in an act of parliament made in the   st hen viii chap    there is an express clause which gives the mayor and burgesses authority to pull down all wears gores and engines in the river of tyne between sparrowhawk and hedwinstreams and in the preamble of the said act it is declared that the soil of the river of tyne etc has been time out of mind enjoyed by the town of newcastle in their demesne as of fee in right of the crown  and also in another act of parliament made the  d of edward vi not printed it is declared that for the maintenance of the said town of newcastle upon tyne and for the preservation of the port and said river of tyne all the sands called shores are settled on the town  and also by letters patents    eliz which confirm to the mayor and burgesses of the said town of newcastle upon tyne their customs which they had by prescription or otherwise it is in particular granted to them to have jurisdiction of a great many statutes mentioned in that charter and amongst other statutes the statute    hen viii chap   which concerns the conservation and preservation of rivers   dly by judgments records inquisitions judgment in quo warranto verdicts at law decrees in the court of exchequer and  upon one decree there is a perpetual injunction which was afterward confirmed in the house of lords on an appeal  judgment in parliament    ed i where the prior of tinmouth having lands adjoining to the said river of tyne at northshields and having built a shore there within the flood mark it was adjudged that it should be removed at the cost of the prior it may not be amiss to give some account of this trial  the contents mentioned in a plea at westminster in the  0th year of edward i between the king and the burgesses of newcastle and the prior of tinmouth quod dominus rex habere debeat totum portum in aqua de tyne a mari usque ad locum qui dicitur hedwinstreams etc  st the whole port in the water of tyne  d his ovens at newcastle the king dues  d for every quarter of corn there baked  th of custom  th the king loses at northshields for the issues of baking per annum  0 l and by the forestalling of the market there  0 l the said prior also takes the wreck of the sea which specially belongs to the king  the king could also take two tunn of wine to be chosen behind and before and every tunn of wine for  0 s of every ship of herrings  00 herrings etc all which the said prior takes at shields and else where by which means the king lost his prises and customs due to him because the same merchandises came not entirely to his due port of newcastle  the prior also built   ovens at tinmouth which were rented at   l   s   d per ann and kept a market on the lords day at tinmouth it was also objected to him that the whole country and the mariners applied themselves and sold their goods and merchandises at shields to the kings great detriment he receiving no toll nor other profits for the same  the king ought to have the towage of ships and boats greater and smaller in the river of tyne in going up to newcastle and down to the sea freely over any lords land etc the king ought to have in his port   d for every boat that has an oar and   d for every lesser one that has none  in answer  the prior said the premises did only touch his free tenement and he answered that as for the wreck of the sea the forestalling of merchandises etc he and his predecessors had them by charter of king john grandfather of king edward i and so he proceeds to his new town of shields  he said also that he had no market or oven at shields but as to the fishers and buying of fish he says that his predecessors in their times have always had their own fishers fishing in the same water for the maintenance of their house toll free etc because the port of the water of tyne does especially and entirely belong to the king and that they meaning the prior and convent of tinmouth have had certain their tenants of shields with their boats within their demesnes  and as for the market at tinmouth he said he claimed none there but he had a tumbrel and had hired fishers brewers and bakers and also shambles there  as to the charge of towage he said that he never hindered those that exercised any such office in the water of tyne adjacent to his land save only at elstwick or astwick  he said moreover that before and at the time of making king richards charter which was before any liberties granted to newcastle by king john the priors of this house took and had all the premises freely and quietly etc by virtue of custom of liberties granted to them by their said charter by land and water whereof he found his church seized etc  whereupon he demanded judgment  those who prosecuted for the king said that the charter was worth nothing as to the wreck of the sea they said no sooner had the ships applied themselves out of the great sea into the said port and there had the misfortune to break then the said prior takes the goods of such broken ships both swimming and therein abiding and converts them to his own use and that the then prior was seized of ten tuns of wine out of a certain ship of peter of appleby burgess of york wrecked in the said water  and as to the charging or discharging of ships and of merchandises etc they said that whereas the said port of tyne is only the kings as often as the prior should do so the king was manifestly injured being then and always before in seizin and possession of the said port  as to the town of shields they said that whatsoever small dwelling houses there had been there etc the said prior that then was caused there to be made    houses upon the kings soil because they are comprehended within the flowing and inundation of the sea and they demanded the record of justice that the said then prior alleged that the king therein has no soil etc but that it merely belonged to him even to the this is supposed to be the low water mark fill of the water  they also said that in those houses at shields there were fishers and brewers and victuallers etc so rich that they were able to give loading and victuals for  00 or  00 ships which ought to apply themselves at newcastle upon tyne and there buy their victuals for the bettering the said town whereupon they said that the said prior is the only occupier of the kings soil and the only taker away of the said kings town of newcastle and that he the said prior had    fishers or more with great boats fishing in the sea yearly for trafficks sake only and not for maintenance of his house whereof the king received neither toll nor custom  they said also that the said prior and his men come out with their horses and carriages and out of such ships as came thither got necessaries for themselves so that most times ships and boats return empty and half laden to other ports than to newcastle aforesaid whereby the king cannot receive his due prises and customs  and after they said that john of the vale i suppose de le val being judge itinerant   edw i it was then reported by the jury that the prior of tinmouth built a town upon the bank of the water of tyne on one side and the prior of durham levied or built another on the other side where no towns ought to be unless lodges only for fishermen and that the fishermen have there sold their fishes which ought to have been sold at newcastle to the great hurt of the said town and loss of the kings prises and that both the said priors of tinmouth and durham have caused to be made brewers and fishers having great ships whereas they ought to have but boats and have caused bread to be baked there which ought to have been baked at newcastle  it is inhibited and forbidden the said prior of tinmouth that from thenceforth he should not hold or cause to be held a market or fair in the aforesaid places and was determined that the port within the water of tyne from the sea to heddon streams is the free port of the king and his heirs with it is prises customs towages tonages with all other profits and commodities incident and belonging to the same etc and that neither at tinmouth nor at shields ships are to be laden or unladen  it was also ordered that   ovens at tinmouth should pay damages   marks and those that took tonnage and make forestal etc and as to the wrecks of the sea etc that the king and his heirs should have them for ever hereafter as to the markets and fairs that there be not at tinmouth or shields any market or fair and that neither at tinmouth or shields there be any sale of things saleable as in meats drinks or any other things whatsoever whereby the king his heirs and successors may be made the worse  it was also ordered that the keys and other things levied and raised by the said prior within the flood mark on the kings soil should be removed at the costs of the said prior  close roll    ed ii membran    it is recited that the king had given power and authority to john earl of hamstead to examine and remove nusances done to the river of tyne and was pleased to recall it because it was a prejudice to what the mayor of newcastle claimed and enjoyed in the time of his predecessors  by an inquisition  th jan    hen vi the jury upon their oath found that beyond the memory of man the town of newcastle upon tyne had and held of our sovereign lord the king and all his predecessors as burgesses of the said town when there was no mayor and as mayor and burgesses of the said town when there was a mayor the said town and water of tyne and the soil of the said water of tyne wherever it was covered from a place called sparrow hawk in the sea

carlisle and the canons of the same  waldenus parsona de newburne was one of the witnesses to the foundation charter of st marys in westgate about the reign of richard i  this manor belonged to the crown till robert fitz roger surnamed de clavering from his manor of clavering in essex obtained a grant of it from king john reg   to hold to him by the service of one knights fee which upon levying the scutage of wales    john he paid his posterity enjoyed this manor long after for robert de clavering who had summons to parliament from the    of edward i to   ed ii died possessed of this manor of newburne and left it to his son and heir john de clavering who despairing of having any issue male settled this manor and some others by way of feossinent upon one stephen de trafford to the intent that the said stephen should reconvey them to the said john to hold for life with the remainder to king ed i and his heirs the king soon after it came to him gave it to henry percy the ancestor of the earls of northumberland in whose family we find it    edw iii for henry earl of northumberland died about that time seized of this manor with diverse other estates and leaving his wife joan surviving this lordship with its members was assigned to her for her dowry among several others after her decease it continued in the percys family diverse successions and was in the   hen v settled upon elizabeth the relict of henry earl of northumberland surnamed hotspur for life and after her decease passed to her son henry who died seized of it and other great estates    hen vi fighting for whom he lost his life at the battle of st albans in hertfordshire king edward iv having by this victory gained a sure possession of the throne henry earl of northumberland his son and successor lost his paternal estate by being attainted in parliament   edward iv and as the major part of his estate was given by that king to his brother george duke of clarence as is above specified so this manor of newburn and newburnhaven were granted to sir robert ogle in consideration of his many faithful services being soon after made a baron of the realm  dr smith late bishop of carlisle finding the vicarage of this place to be small and not able to maintain a minister made an augmentation of    l a year to it since the restoration of king charles ii magn britan vol   p      this manor is now part of the estate of his most noble grace charles duke of somerset  the next village to it is stella a little below newburn on the other side the water here is a magnificent house and gardens which belonged to the lord widdrington which became forfeited to the crown in the year      for his entering into the northumberland rebellion this place originally belonged to the nuns of newcastle it is now chiefly inhabited by coalworkers and has staiths in it  there are many other villages on the sides of this river such as blaiden lemmington swalwel delaval redheugh etc several of them have staiths belonging to them such are the staiths of the lady clavering sir henry liddel baronet richard ridley esquire george liddel esquire edward wortley montague esquire george bows esquire george pit esquire george malliber esquire mr john simpson and mr joseph ledger  there is a little island in the midst of the river called the kings meadows which is a delicious place and a great ornament to the river  let us now come below bridge to take notice of a few things there gateshead presents itself first a town in the bishopric of durham it stands on the south side of the tyne opposite to newcastle and is a place of great antiquity mr cambden thinks it a place of equal antiquity with newcastle because of it is ancient name gabrosentum but i have already proved it more rational to believe it to have been only it is suburbs  there was an ancient monastry here in the time of bid which was the monastry of utanus it was where mr riddles house or gateshead house is as it now stands  on the    of may  0 0 walter bishop of durham was murdered at this place the occasion of it was this walter attending more wordly affairs than the charge of his flock gave himself altogether to temporal business wherein he wholly occupied himself he bought of the king the earldom of northumberland and then making himself a secular judge took upon him to sit in the court and to determine all causes at his pleasure dealing withal very corruptly and taking still the course that might be most for his own gain hereupon he greatly enriched his own coffers but purchased unto himself extreme hatred amongst the common people which was his destruction in the end there was a certain gentleman of great account named leulfus that married algitha the daughter of aldred sometime earl of northumberland from whom the lord lumley that now lives is lineally descended this leulfus to the end he might live near the church in his latter time and for very devotion came to durham to dwell there and kept company very much with the bishop who loved him entirely for many good parts he saw in him as namely his wisdom in discerning his equity in deciding and his discretion in ordering and handling such causes as he committed unto him in which respect also he used him very familiarly employed him often and gave him what countenance he could now you shall understand that unto the same bishop belonged two men unto whom for the most part he committed the ordering of all his affairs leofwyn or leobwyn his chaplain whom he trusted with all housholdmatters and gilbert a kinsman of his own that dealt in his causes of temporal government in their offices they behaved themselves so as the bishop had cause to commend their diligence but to blame their rashness and wilfulness in many things which notwithstanding he bore withal either because their industry and care of his affairs so blinded his eyes as he could not espy their misbehaviour otherwise or else being loath to detest them whom he had once advanced these men and especially leofwyn did greatly envy the credit that leulfus had gotten with the bishop and every where opposed themselves against him not only in words traducing his actions but in deeds also thwarting and crossing his endeavors whereby it came to pass that many jars fell out between them one day amongst the rest a court being held in the presence of the bishop leofwyn or leobwyn for so also i find him called according to his wonted manner gave leulfus ill speeches which he not enduring to bear as heretofore he had done furor fit saepius laesa patientia answered this saucy chaplain somewhat more roundly than he had been accustomed whereupon he rose straight from the court in great indignation  leofwyn i mean and calling gilbert aside with little ado persuaded him to carry a certain number of armed men to the house where leulfus lay and in a night to kill him which indeed he performed with great cruelty murdering not only the innocent gentleman himself but also his servants and whole household the news of this horrible and outrageous cruelty coming unto the ears of the bishop amazed him very much and suspecting it was done by the advice of leofwyn turning about unto him o leofwyn says he thou have already slain me by thy tongue so not doubting it would breed much danger unto him he got into his castle and presently dispatched messengers unto the friends and kindred of leulfus that was slain protesting that the fact was committed without his knowledge that he was mavelous sorry for it and if any man suspected him would be ready to submit himself to any order of law whereby he might clear himself herewith they seemed to be satisfied but for conclusion of a firm peace amongst them it was thought fit they should meet and consider of the matter they met at a place called goatshead the bishop for his better safeguard betook himself unto the church with his company the people whereof an infinite number were gathered together abode without messages a while past between them but the more the matter was debated being very odious of itself the more the people were incensed at last it was told them how not only leofwyn but also gilbert had been harbored in the bishops house and afforded countenance by him since the murder which being once heard and it was true enough they all cried out it was manifest that the bishop was the author of this fact it is furthermore delivered by matthew paris that the bishop not only before this amongst many intolerable exactions laid upon the country by him had commanded the sum of  00 l to be levied at this time that being also remembered while as all the people stood in a murmuring doubting what course to take one of some special regard amongst them slept up using these words short read good read slay ye the bishop hereupon without more ado they ran all unto the church killed so many of the bishops retinue as they found without doors and with horrible noise and outcries bid him and his company to come out unto them too late then he repented that he had committed himself unto the fury of a discontented multitude with whom he knew himself before that time nothing gracious but to make the best of a bad match and to try all means of ridding himself from the danger imminent he persuaded his kinsman gilbert there present to go forth unto them if happily his death which doubtless he had deserved might satisfy their fury and purchase safety unto his lord and master gilbert was content and issuing out with diverse of the bishops company were all slain except only two englishmen servants unto the bishop all the rest were normans they being not yet satisfied he besought leofwyn whose life he knew well was principally sought to go out also but he utterly refused so to do the bishop therefore going unto the churchdoor entreated them not to take his life from him protesting himself to be utterly guiltless of the blood of leulfus and showed them at large how dangerous it would be to them in particular and what inconvenience would follow to the whole country in general if they should defile their hands in shedding his blood an unarmed priest a sacred and consecrated bishop their ruler their governor their magistrate hoping lastly that his very countenance his gravity his age and the sight of his person might move them to compassion for he was indeed a very reverend man to see to very tall of stature head and beard as white as snow his face fresh and well colored and every way very personable he went out carrying a green branch in his hand that so he might testify his desire of peace when he saw that all this availed not and the people ran furiously upon him he cast his gown over his own head in like sort as we read julius caesar did in the like case and permitting himself to their fury with innumerable wounds was pitifully massacred together with all his people and retinue to the number of an hundred only leofwyn yet remained within the church and being often called would not come forth so they set the church on fire not enduring the fire he leaped out of a window and was immediately hewn into a thousand pieces the monks of yarrow came and fetched away the bishops body which they found stark naked and could hardly know it for the multitude of wounds they carried it to their monastery from whence it was conveyed to durham and there buried on the south side of the chapter house but secretly for fear of the murderers that roved up and down the town and once assaulted the castle when they found that they could not prevail there they dispersed themselves and for the most part came to evil and unhappy ends the king in the mean time hearing of this tumult sent his brother odo bishop of bayan with many of his nobles and a great army to take punishment of this murder which while they sought to revenge they brought the whole country to desolation those that were guilty prevented the danger toward them by flight so as few of them could be taken of the rest that stayed at home some were unjustly executed and the rest compelled to ransom themselves to their utter impoverishing and undoing the chiefest doer in this outrage was one eadulsus surnamed rus descended of the earls of northumberland who as some say slew the bishop with his own hands and afterward by the just judgment of god was himself slain by a woman and his body though once buried in the church of godworth was taken up by the commandment of turgost prior of durham and forbidden christian burial at this time odo took away from the church of durham certain ornaments of great value amongst which is especially remembered a certain crosier of inestimable price in this bishops days and by his endeavor secular clerks were displaced and the church of durham replenished with monks the pope the king and the archbishop allowing this alteration goodwyn fol      afterward this church was new built and placed where it now stands for according to tradition it stood before in the field below where brickkilns now are  this church of st marys gateshead is in the gift of the bishop of durham but once during the vacancy of the sea it was given to robert de plesuys the value of it then was    marks per annum  it is at present a very neat pretty church being exceeding well pewd having a small organ and a ring of eight bells which were last year founded by contribution etc  it has had several worthy men its ministers such were dr laidler john cave m a dr tully dr pickering leonard shafto m a the reverend mr stilling fleet who was inducted anno      removed to ryton in      and is succeeded in this church by mr lamb the present incumbent  there belonged to this church the hospital of st edmund which was founded by nicholas

bishop of durham to all men of the whole bishopric and of his brotherhood in all england he saluteth  know ye that we have granted and by his present deed have granted to our burgesses of gatesheved full liberty of forestage yielding in every half year from pentecost to the feast of st martin for a wheye or ox the which goes to grass   d and for a horse   d and for every hog   d in respect of all things that they have to proper and necessary uses saving these prohibited neither shall it be lawful for any forester within the meats that are appointed within our forest and borough to tax lands upon any burgess or upon any manner of thing of the said borough or upon any oxen or any other their cattle or by any ways to hinder them either of their wood timber or any other things and if any suit or trouble shall be between the foresters and burgesses it shall be determined in the said borough if it may be if not then in our presence it shall be determined and the cattle of any burgess shall not be carried out of the said borough but there shall be replevied if the same may be replevied to the same burgesses it shall be lawful to have herbage and lying turfs and bruery to their own proper uses wheresoever they are accustomed to have the same so that they sell us part thereof and if any burgess do dig turfs for his chimney not having oxen if for the leading of turfs they shall be forced to have oxen nevertheless in giving for all or every ox which they shall need   d of forestage they shall be freed and it shall be lawful for every burgess to give wood to whomsoever he will to be spent about the river of tyne without any license but not to sell any without license of the foresters and no forester shall disturb any merchandise that comes within the said meat and every burgess of gatesheved shall have of his burgage the same liberty which the burgesses of newcastle have of their burgages and whithersoever the burgesses of gatesheved or their cattle shall come within our land in the peace of god and blessed st cuthbert they shall pass that no man to them shall do any injury or any demand or exaction of them shall require we do grant also to the same burgesses that they shall have common of pasture and like parts of feeding to all their houses and all commodities which they ought to have of subtwell meadows as they were wont to have as in deeds of good memory of our predecessors reasonably is contained  in the  th of edward vi the mayor and burgesses of newcastle petitioned the king that the town of gatesheved in the county of durham adjoining to their corporation only the river of tyne between being populous and without government and often committing many outrages in their town and then got over the water into the town of gatesheved unpunished and that often they cast rubbish into the river and also that the bridge went to decay very much which belonged to that town humbly beseeching that his majesty would be graciously pleased to incorporate that town with them under their government with all its members and saltmeadows and park and that it might be quite taken from the county of durham and all the people therein to become subordinate to their laws  whereupon it was enacted the whole town of gatesheved with the saltmeadows the whole water and bridge with all the liberties thereunto belonging except the common which should remain to the inhabitants should be incorporated with newcastle and disjoined from the county of durham as newcastle was from northumberland by charter gardener p      first mary so soon as bishop tunstal was created bishop of durham he petitioned her majesty to restore gatesheved to the county of durham again and that the said act  th edward vi might be repealed and it was repealed accordingly and enacted that the town of gatesheved should be free from the corporation of newcastle etc gardener p      on the same side of the tyne a little below are the fields called the saltmeadows  in going down the water we meet with several staiths such are the staith of richard ridley esquire and matthew white esquire at the glasshouse bridge the staiths of richard ridley esquire at st lawrence and st peters keys of walter blacket esquire and mr john wilkinson of francis rudston esquire and of edward wortley montague esquire we meet also with several keys such are winkemley billkey willingtonkey hebbournkey etc  we meet also with several villages such are dentshole st anthons snowdons hole howdon panns jarroiv etc  when the hoastmen renewed their charter they had license to send coals above the bill and mr coal procured a shore at friargoose mr henry chapman procured a shore upon hewithgrounds and mr robert brandling with much ado got leave to build a shore upon his own ground at fellin in the mean time the tenants of the dean and chapter at durham took liberty to throw their ashes into the river which did much damage to the bar upon this mr leonard carr and mr cuthbert bewick complained and the town caused them to lay them upon the land of which they have made mighty heaps  when king james i came to the crown he was pleased to be bountiful to his countrymen amongst the rest sir henry gibb being one of his officers he bestowed upon him the lordship of jarrow and he would have procured a shore there to cast ballast but although he had the favor of the king yet the town used such means and gave such reasons to his majesty and the council that they found it detrimental to the town and especially to the river so that he was utterly hindered and disappointed  but after the death of king charles i thomas bonner and robert ellison got in to be magistrates and these men having gotten wealth and increase by the rebellion did purchase jarrow and what could not be done before in a lawful time they did bring to pass at this unlawful juncture building a shore and casting ballast to the great detriment of the river and having the town at command mr bonner bought st anthonys and robert ellison bought hebbourn and there they both built shores and got the allowance of the common council when they were beyond resisting and since that mr carr a man that deserved well of his present majesty  charles ii and the town has procured that his brother ellison for old ellisons son married his sister should have liberty to erect his shore to a great length which in time will utterly overthrow our navigation for they will damn out the indraught which makes rivers far off the sea be walled out it will go by and not come in and some ancient and discreet masters of ships have said they have not left a birth to save their ships in when any landstood or storm happens in the river milbank  the next place jarrow or girwy as it was anciently called which is a small village on the south side of tyne about   miles distant from newcastle famous for a monastery of learned men but more so for the birth life and death of venerable bede so named for his singular sanctity who was born of mean parents and at seven years of age delivered to the holy abbot st benedict to be educated in his rule and being come to age he professed a monastic life in the abbeys of weremouth and girwy where he became by his constant application to his studies so complete a scholar that few in that age which bred many very learned men were to compare to him for he was perfectly knowing in the greek and latin tongues and no less perfect in poetry rhetoric logic physics metaphysikcs astronomy arithmetic all ecclesiastical calculations music geometry cosmography history philosophy and divinity in short he had an exact knowledge of all commendable sciences insomuch that william of malmsbury thus describes him he was a man that may more worthily be admired than commended for he was born in an extreme corner of the world yet the light of his learning spread over all parts of the earth he continued a most diligent learner till he was thirty years of age after which being ordained priest he betook himself to teaching and writing all the hours he had to spare from the monastical excerises of prayer and singing in the choirs by day and night in which he was constant and very devout he most diligently spent in his studies so that his life was a continual intercourse between devotion and study he never repairing to his study till he had been at prayers nor ever went to prayers but from his studies by which continual application he penetrated into all sciences in his continual deportment he was so grave and serious that the title of venerable was bestowed on him while he lived and ever continued to him after his death it appears from history that he had at one time those great lights of the church alcuinus preceptor to the emperor charlemaign and claudius and clemens the founders of the universities of paris and pavia for his scholars  this character is fully verified by the books of all sorts of learning writ by him at the end of his works he gives us a modest account of his own life together with a catalogue of his principal works henry of huntington gives us also a large catalogue of his writings too long to be set down here yet we cannot omit some of the principal works viz  an incredible number of treatises upon all parts of the old and new testament many of which are still to be found in the bodleian library at oxford  above an hundred homilies and many pieces of divinity and devotion  a small book of the holy land  a chronicle from the creation  a book of the writers of the church  a martyrology  an epitome of the english history  of the situation and wonderful things of great britain  the lives of many holy men and abbots with many others of all sorts of learning  this most excellent person being grown old in the study of learning and all christian virtues grew weak and decripit for a time and at length on the tuesday before ascension his distemper grew so heavy upon him that nature yielded to it and he died on ascension day in the seventy second year of his age but others say the ninetieth anno     and was buried in his monastery but afterward his body was translated to durham magn brit vol  d p   0  nor is it to be admired that he should become so learned in his monastery for in former ages the greater monasteries were like universities wherein not only humanity but all the liberal sciences philosophy and divinity were taught in the year     he received deacons orders from the hands of john bishop of hexham afterward called st john of beverley and in the year  0  he was ordained priest by the same bishop  among the several ways of accounting for his epithet of venerable it has always been esteemed the most pleasing though perhaps not the most true account of what is said to have happened after his death viz that one of his scholars designing to make his epitaph in hexameter verse which began thus hac sunt in fossa and was willing to make it end presbiteri ossa but it would

saving light of the gospel began to shine abroad in the world for it is not impertinent to note thus much were called basilicae because the basilicae of the gentiles namely those stately buildings where the magistrates held the courts of justice were converted to churches by the christians whence ausonius basilica olim negotiis plena nunc votis i e the basilica full of business heretofore but now of devotion or else because they were built in an oblong form as the basilicae were  in the inscription the xui should be xu for king elfrid reigned no more than    years and so indeed sir james ware has given it in his notes upon bedes history of the abbots of weremouth but it ought not from this inscription to be inferred that ceolfrid was the founder of this monastry since it appears from

discovered a roman altar the figure and description whereof take here as it was delivered to the royal society by the ingenious and learned dr lister  fig   fig   fig   fig   fig     i have says he in his letter to the royal society with much trouble got into my hands a piece of roman antiquity which was but a very few years ago discovered upon the southbank of the river tyne near sheilds in the bishopric it is a very large and fair roman altar of one entire stone but after all my cost and pains i am very sorry to find the inscription very ill defaced and much of it is not legible and i believe it has been also much mishandled by those who have endeavored to read it whereas if the remainder of the letters had been exactly measured and the face blacked and lightly washed off again as in prints some things more might have been spelled  as to the nature of the stone itself it is of a coarse rag the same with that of the pyramids at burrowbriggs it is four foot high and was ascended to by steps which appears in all the sides but the front has two squareholes near the bottom which let in the irons that joined it to the steps  i have carefully designed it on all its sides and given the plan of the top also which if you please we will survey in order    the backside opposite to the inscription on which is engraven in bassrelief a flowerpot furnished i suppose with what best pleased the stonecutter for these men needed not be more curious than the priests themselves who were wont to make use of herbs next hand to adorn the altars and therefore verbenae is put for any kind of herb yet if we will have it resemble any thing with us i think it is most like if not truly nymphaea a known and common river plant    one of the sides which is somewhat narrower than the front or back on this are engraved in bassrelief the cutting knife cecespita and the ax securis the knife is exactly the same with that on the other altar formerly by me mentioned in the philosophical collections of mr hook but the ax is different for here it is headed with a long and crooked point and there the head of the ax is divided into three points    the other side on which are engraved after the same manner an eure urceolus and a ladle which serves for a sympullum this i call rather a laddle than a mallet it being perfectly dishwife and hollow in the middle although cambden is of another opinion in that elegant sculpt of the cumberland altar and the very same utensil i have seen and noted on the ickley altar which is yet extant at middletongrange near that town but the stone which cambden says supports a pair of stairs there as at this day it does in the very road is but an ill copy of it and not the original    the plan of the top which is cut in the figure of a basin  disons or lana with ansae on each side consisting of a pair of links of a chain which rest upon and fall over two rowles and this was the hearth    the front which has an inscription in nine lines in roman letters each letter a little more than two inches deep of our measure now remaining as in the prefixed sculpture fig   which i would read thus dis deabusque matribus pro salute m aurelii antonii augusti imperatoris votum solvit lubens merito ob reditum  the deae matres are well interpreted by seldon it is much his safety and return both vowed should be so separated in the inscription but i have not gruter by me to compare this with the like caracalla say the historians ziphilinus herodianus etc after his fathers death at york took upon him the command of the army alone and the whole empire he went alone against the enemy who were the caledonii inhabiting beyond the wall which his father had built he made peace with them received their hostages slighted their fortified places and returned and this seems to be confirmed by the inscription for undoubtedly upon this last expedition alone without his brother gera and mother was this altar erected to him alone at a place about two stations on this side the wall so that the vow might be as well understood of his return from this expedition as for his sasety and return to rome which methinks should be true or his mother and brother geta would scarce have been left out at least so early for yet the army declared for them both according to their fathers will  further it seems also to have been erected by those who flattered him and who were afterward killed by him and for this reason the persons who dedicated it seem to me to be purposely defaced the sixth and seventh lines of the inscription being designedly cut away by the hollowness of them and there not being the least sign of any letter remaining and this i suppose might be part of their disgrace as it was usual to deface and break the statues and monuments of persons executed of which this monster made strange havoc and since worn inscriptions admit of various readings because some letters are worn out and some more legible whereby unprejudiced people may conceive them diversely i will therefore tell you another reading part of these two first lines which i do not disallow but that it will agree well enough with the history of severus though his apotheosis or solemn dedication was not performed till he came to rome in the manner of which funeral pomp herodian is very large it was of that excellent antiquary dr johnson of pomfret  conservato ri b pro sal etc which shows the height of flattery of those times so that they paid their vows to the lately dead father the conservator of britain for the safety of the son and the story tells us how gladly he would have had him made a god long before even with his own hands cambden britan in the additions to durham p      below this are the towns of shields one on the north side of the river and the other on the south that on the north side in the reign of edward the  st when the contest was between the town of newcastle and the prior of tinmouth was a place where only   or   fisherman had their cottages and it is but of late years that it became a large town and so populous the churchbelonging to this place was begun to be built in       south shields is more famous for making salt than north shields there being much the greater number of salt pans it is also a pretty large town and has a church which going to decay is about to be rebuilt it is a chapelry to jarrow and dedicated to st hilda  we come now to the mouth of the river tyne which is a haven so deep as to carry vessels of a considerable burden and of that security that they are not in danger either of storms or shallows save that within less than half a mile of the bar of tinmouth which is a sand that lies cross the rivers mouth not above   foot deep at low water you meet with many rocks which are called by the sailors the black middens which are very dangerous but to prevent any mischiefs which may happen to them in the night time there are two lighthouses maintained by the trinityhouse in newcastle and near them in the year      was built a fort called cliffords fort which effectually commands all the vessels that enter the river  leland in the  th volume of his collections gives us the following most valuable remark of a roman station on the south side of the tyne the place of the birth of king oswyn for says he  e regione tinemuthae suit urbs vastata a danis ursa nomine ubi natus erat oswinus rex  tinmouth called by the britains pen ball cragg i e the head of the rampire upon the rock from whence some maintain that the ditch reached as far as this place if the wall did not mr cambden says that he will not gainsay this opinion but adds that he dares confidently affirm that this place in the time of the romans was called tunacellum which signifies as much as the promontory of tuna or tina where the first cohort called aelia classica because it was first raised by aelius hadrianus as the name seems to import was in pay for sea service for the romans had their naves lusoriae or light frigates in their border rivers both for the suppressing the excursions of the neighboring enemy and making incursions upon him as may be seen in the codex theodosii under the title de lusoriis danubii i e light vessels on the danube  under the saxon heptarchy this place was called tunaceltep not as bede affirms from the abbot tunna a mere romantic story which if we recommend to the reader it must be only for his diversion and not for any truth in it but from it is situation on the river tyne here was anciently a little monastery which was frequently plundered by the danes while the saxons ruled magn britan p      after the decease of oswyn those that had killed him brought his body to the mouth of the river tyne and there buried it in the oratory of st marys in the year      in this place a number of illustrious persons had gathered together who in a regular order attended divine worship who thereby acquired such honor and esteem that when any one died of more than ordinary reputation whose funeral was to be solemnized with more than common honor he was usually buried here  this monastery was destroyed by hinguar and hubba the monks through fear of persecution fled to a certain little church of their own which st cuthbert had dedicated but the danes finding them out burnt it and all that were in it  after that william the conqueror had given to robert mowbray the county of northumberland the earl showed a deal of respect to st oswyn and the church he was buried in for the church was founded within the precincts of his castle he gifted it with a number of lands and placed in it monks which came from st albans and yet it is said by some that tosti earl of northumberland laid the foundation of this monastery but it is much more probable it was the former because he brought the monks from st albans but it will appear a great deal more likely when we come to the following grant or charter of william rufus for making of it a cell to willielmus rex anglorum t archiepiscopo and w dunelmensi episcopo and omnibus baronibus suis francis and anglis salutem sciatis me dedisse and concessisse deo and sancto albano

being afterward fortified and turned into a strong hold was called tinmouthcastle which name it still bears and as such glories both of its stateliness and strength for as an ancient author speaks it is inaccessibly seated upon a very high rock toward the ocean on the east and north and elsewhere so well mounted that a slender garrison may make it good for this reason robert mowbray earl of northumberland when he practiced with certain noblemen to dethrone william rufus because he had not rewarded him according to his expectation for slaying malcom king of scots and his son but was set upon by the king before things were ripe for rebellion chose this castle for his chief hold and maintained it for some time against the king and his forces but being at length brought into great straits by the besiegers as rebels seldom meet with success he fled and betook himself to the adjoining monastery which was accordingly commonly reputed an holy and inviolable sanctuary nevertheless he was carried off thence and afterward in a long and noisome imprisonment justly suffered death for his treason magn britan vol   p      john of whethamstede thirty third abbot of st albans was so called from the place of his birth a village near st albans but the name of his family was bostock he was a monk of the priory of tinmouth and gave after he came to be abbot a chalice of pure gold and of great weight to that priory his character cannot be better drawn up than in stephens monasticon from whence we have this account contegit iste lapis venerabilis ossa joannis wethamstede abbas hic qui fuit ejus in annis ter doctus doctos and amans etc that is this stone covers the bones of the venerable john wethamstede who was abbot here in his time most learned a lover of learned men and kind to them he did not connive at any faults in the clergy he was as zealous as phineas against lewd persons and as john against adulterers and even as peter against simoniacks he was so great a repairer of old tattered houses and marks that none past exceeded him in that particular or is there any equal to him he is recorded to have left behind him ten thousand marks clear do you the convent of st

to be rebuilt in the year      and being afterward finished was consecrated by bishop cosins in the year      in the former church we may suppose it was where malcom king of scots slain with his son edward prince of scotland by robert mowbray earl of northumberland was buried this king malcom had barbarously plundered and ravaged these northern parts five times once in edward the confessors days twice in the conquerors and twice in william rufuss in the last of which invasions he met with his fate by that just providence who often retaliates wrongs in the place they are done as he found for he was killed in this country where he had slain and destroyed many but king william did not prosecute his revenge further as he might have done with success but established his son on his throne notwithstanding the endeavors and design of his uncle donald to deprive him of it which he had done had not king william aided him to obtain it  john of tinmouth was born in this town and is said to have been the vicar of it but afterward became a benedictine monk in the abbey of st albans he was a most virtuous person and excellently learned entirely addicted to the study of the holy scriptures and of sacred history he gathered the lives and actions of the saints of england wales scotland and ireland with great judgment and indefatigable labor which work he entitled sanctilogium servorum dei i e the sacred history of the servants of god nor did he deserve less commendation for his expositions of the holy scripture in which he not only explains the literal sense but the moral allegorical and tropological his commentaries were upon all the books from genesis to the kings inclusive he wrote also other books as churchlessons the golden history and a supplement to the same an appendix to his martyrology etc he flourished about the year       the church has perhaps been a building of as much art and curiosity as any one in the whole kingdom nay when we behold it at present in the midst of ruins we are struck with aw and the utmost veneration whether it is a reflection on the extensive charity of ancient days the surprising fineness of the masonry or whether there is something naturally moving in those ancient remains but so it is that it never fails to command a solemn aw and a silent commiseration  tinmouth at present is a pretty large village and is much resorted to in

saxons and danes it is certain after the conquest it was governed by bailiffs for though the castle had privileges of its own yet it left those of the town as they were and without any damage as shall by and by be shown in the mean time let us consider a few things relating to this place   0   toston earl of northumberland son of the great earl godwin and brother of harold having by his great cruelties and many acts of injustice highly exasperated the northumbrians they took up arms against him and expelled him northumberland in  0   in the reign of edward the confessor harold being ordered to go and chastize them and restore his brother and understanding that they had no design of withdrawing their obedience from the king but only from an unjust and cruel governor who exercised over them a tyrannical power he not only interceeded for their pardon but procured them morkard son of alfgar duke of mercia for their governor toston highly incensed at his brothers proceedings and not having it in his power to vent his fury on him he turned it on some of his domestics whom he caused to be cut in pieces then to be barreld up and sent to his brother for a present after so barbarous an action not daring to stay any longer in england he retired into flanders to earl baldwin his fatherinlaw upon harolds being made king after the death of edward toston in  0   with some ships probably given him by the earl of flanders infested the english coasts and plundered the isle of wight from whence he went and landed some troops at sandwich but being informed the king was marching toward him he set sail for the north and entering the humber with his little fleet he made a descent on yorkshire and committed vast ravages but morkard coming upon him unawares being then got into lincolnshire put his little army to flight and compelled him to betake himself to his ships being drove by contrary winds on the coasts of norway he applied himself to harold harfager king of that country and by many arguments represented to him how easy it was to conquer england and add that crown to his own the king of norway whose ambition was easily persuaded by the others arguments accompanied with earl toston put to sea with a fleet of  00 sail and entered the tyne after having sacked the countries on both sides the tyne they put to sea and entering the humber landed their forces on the north side and ravaged the country with iriexpressible cruelties harold marched against them with all the expedition possible and came up with them at stanfordbridge on the river derwent

earl of northumberland revolting against king william rufus the king went and besieged him in banborrough castle  0   sometime after mowbray going out upon a false information had the misfortune to fall into the hands of the besiegers odericus vitalis says some soldiers belonging to newcastle upon tyne promised to give him entrance into that town if he would come thither privately with a few followers upon which he went out one night with  0 soldiers but being betrayed by his own men was pursued and taken by the garrison of malvoisin i e bad neighbor being a fortress built by the king near banborrough and so called by him because it took away all possibility of throwing any succors into the castle  in this kings reign malcolme iii king of scotland came to gloucester to the king to commune with him about sundry matters that related to the peace of both realms but not being received and entertained in the pompous manner he expected he returned into his own nation in displeasure and immediately getting his army together entered england and destroyed the country as far as alnwick castle which he besieged and so straightned that it was upon the very point of surrendering a soldier having promised to deliver up the keys upon the top of his spear which while he pretended to do he stabbed the king with it at the same time robert mowbray earl of northumberland lay in ambush for the return of the scots who upon the loss of their king lest the siege and being going homeward fell into the ambush and were many of them slain and amongst them edward prince of scotland thus did

whose succession both stephen himself and he had sworn in the reign of her father henry the first upon which david suddenly invaded the frontiers and as the chronicle of mailross acquaints us miserably waisted all northumberland and took both carlisle and newcastle which he filled with garrisons against those king stephen marched with a powerful army and concerning this war there are diverse reports yet all agree that in no long time a peace was concluded by which david still enjoyed carlisle and his son henry the earldom of huntington for which he did homage to king stephen but his father refused to do the same alleging that he had already given his faith to the empress matilda eachard  oct   th      the king died and was succeeded by hen ii       this king made at chester a

father had held paris hovden the restitution of these places says rapin was doubtless no more than what was just since david grandfather to malcolme had caused them to be adjudgd to him by treaties at a time when stephen minded more his own private interest than the public good of the kingdom but in all appearance henrys great power contributed more than any thing else to the bringing the king of scotland to this temper  after these things we meet with some accounts of this place for we are told that king henry ii confirmed their estates to them and exempted them from tolls and duties it is therefore a mistake in some who say the town had no privileges till the reign of king john and besides in the third of king johns reign which was above ten years before the town had a charter from that king the town had great privileges for the men of newcastle upon tyne as is mentioned in that year in the great roll of northumberland paid  00 marks and   palfreys so having the town in their

is this king john of scotland having in contempt of king edward disseised magdulph earl of fife and imprisoned him magdulph complained to king edward who ordered king john to appear before him but upon this summons he appeared not upon this the king sent out a second writ ordering him to appear before him    days after michaelmas which was obeyed being come before him he seemed not so sensible of the kings superiority as he had been before which was judged a contempt and disobedience and that three of his principal castles in scotland should be seized but before the pronunciation of the sentence he came before the king and his council and made supplication to the king with his own mouth the king receiving this with the advice of his council and the consent of magdulph granted his prayer and gave him day until his parliament after easter but that parliament was not holden that day however the suit between the king of scots and magdulph was continued and prorogued to the next parliament which was summoned to be holden at st edmund sbury on the feast of st martin in the winter in the year       the day being come the king was present and magdulph strenuously prosecuted his plea but the king of scotland instead of appearing in person sent the abbot of abirbrothock and other noblemen of that kingdom with not only frivolous excuses but to demand satisfaction of king edward for many and great injuries oppressions and grievances sustained by the scots from his subjects king edward s answer was that for certain causes he was coming toward the north parts and that the king of scots should then have sufficient recompense to his own content and then appointed him a day to meet him at newcastle upon tyne viz the  st day of march next following and ordered the abbot and those with him to give notice to their king that he should then personally appear in the mean time the king had certain intelligence that the king of scots with his prelates earls barons etc had entered into a confederacy with france so that the king of england upon this account also toward the time appointed prepared for his journey to newcastle and sent before him the abbot of newminster and wellebeck to the king of scots to give him notice of the adjournment and time of his coming  on the  st of march      the king was at newcastle and staid there many days expecting the king of scots he came not the king of england removed nearer to scotland and came to bamburgh where he also summoned him and expected him he neither came nor sent to excuse himself but returned the homage and fealty for himself and all his kingdom to king edward by an instrument or writing and defied him after this he summoned him again but he would not appear nay instead of that they proceed to arms enter england plunder burn waste kill and destroy wherever they come  to obviate these insolences and chastise them according to their deserts king edward entered scotland on wednesday in easter week besieged and took berwick castle with a great slaughter of the scots from thence he sent part of his army to reduce the castle of dunbarr lately revolted which was done by the death and destruction of a great many scots ten thousands says my author seven barons an hundred knights and thirty one esquires were taken in the castle the army coming to relieve it twenty two thousand of them were slain from thence king edward marched to edinburgh which castle he took in eight days from thence he marched to sterlin where the king of scots and many of his great men sent to beg his mercy he ordered them to meet him some few days after at brechin where they submitted to his mercy and favor without making any terms or conditions whatever  this done king edward caused the stone used by the kings of scotland as a throne to be brought to westminster appointed john warren earl of surrey and sussex governor of scotland hugh de cressingham treasurer and william ormsby justiciary sent king john baliol

general who by common consent sent to the king then atyork petitioning him either to deliver earl gaveston to them or oblige him to quit the kingdom according to the late ordinances the king took small notice of their supplications left york and repaired to newcastle where he continued for a considerable space upon which the lords with what forces they could raise marched with all speed toward newcastle not that they would offer injury or create trouble to their sovereign but only earl gaveston and judge him according to the laws they made by common agreement upon their approach the king and gaveston immediately fled to tinmouth and though tne queen then great with child with flood of tears begged of him not to leave her in that place he without any pity took shipping and saltd with his favorite toscarborough commanding the garrison of the castle to protect him while he repaired into warwickshire the earl of lancaster having possessed himself of newcastle sent messengers to the queen attinmouth to comfort her faithfully promising that he would not give over his pursuit till he had removed gaveston from the king excusing himself from not coming to her in person left for her sake he should incut the kings indignation the barons who had entered newcastle the same day the king went from thence had seized all that he and his favorite had left there the hurry wherein they

publicly and before so many persons that the cognizors must be known to some of them which allows no opportunity for a fraud  and when a fine is to be acknowledged by a wife she is not only

before him for about  0 miles in length till he came to newcastle upon tyne which he resolved to besiege and so sat down with all his forces before it the captain of the castle was the lord john nevil of hornby a person of great conduct and bravery who resolving to give the young king of scotland a taste of the english valor as soon as might be commanded  00 lances to make a sally very early next morning these dashing suddenly with great fury into the scottish host on that part where the earl of murray was who as they say was chief general for the time the king himself keeping private took the earl himself naked in bed dragged him away naked out of his tent and so having slain several of his men and won much booty they returned all safe into the town with great joy and delivered the earl of murray prisoner to their captain the earl was a chief prince of the blood in scotland next of quality to prince robert stuart and the earl of southerland but for valor and conduct he yielded to none this daring enterprise having alarmed the whole camp the scots ran like madmen to the barriers of the town and began a fierce assault which they continued a great while with much pertinency but they gained little and lost much for there were many good men of war within who defended themselves with much resolution and discretion so that the scots were at last fain to leave off their attac and the hopes of suddenly revenging their dishonor in that place wherefore that bold and lucky attempt of the besieged being thus well backed by a vigorous defense was sufficient to persuade king david and his council that to dally about newcastle was dangerous whereupon about noon they decamped and went for durham  as soon as the lord nevil had seen for certain the departure of the scots he guessed their design upon which he mounted a very swift gelding and coasting wide of the scots rode post day and night till on the  th night he rode more than  00 miles to chertsey in surry where at that time king edward lay to whom he exactly related all he knew of the scots whereupon the king made all the haste he could northward  in the mean time the scots assaulted durham with all the fury imaginable for they were even stark mad for the former affront they had received at newcastle when they lost the earl of murray so dishonourably they reared their engines to cast stones and other devices they had whereby to approach the walls under the shelter of certain machines resembling the ancient testudo of the romans or the synospismus of the greeks and withal they had other engines running upon wheels wherein on lofts as high as the walls at least there were crossbows and others who kept the besieged from the defenses so that after the assault had been continually renewed with all the vigor imaginable and on the other hand maintained with incredible obstinacy for   or   days the scots entered the city by force at which time king david in revenge of all his losses for so many years preceding especially being urged beyond his nature by the importunate instigations of his french auxiliaries then with him commanded his captains to put all to fire and sword there were men women and children old and young men of the church as monks priests canons and others holy and profane all without pity or distinction put to death neither churches monasteries nor shrines no not that of st cuthbert himself after it had reposed there for more than  00 years could reconcile the incensed mind of the soldiers to pity not so much as one soul was left alive within the place so implacable and unmerciful is the sword of war when sharpened with unchristian cruelty  before the scottish army got back to its own country the king of england was upon their heels but there were certain noblemen on both parts who earnestly labored to compose the matters between the two kings which at last took such effect that a truce was concluded for two years barns hist ed iii p             rich galleway

incurably wounded and his sword beat out of his hand disdaining captivity provoked the english by opprobrious language to kill him and when john copeland governor of roxborough castle advised him to yield he struck him on the fate with his gauntlet so fiercely that he knocked out two of his teeth but however copeland conveyed him away out of the field a prisoner upon his refusing to deliver him up to the queen who stayed at newcastle during the battle the king sent for him to calais where he excused his refusal so handsomely that the king sent him back with a reward of  00 l a year in land where he himself should choose it near his own dwelling and made him a knight banneret act publ v p     as quoted by tyndal rapin s translator  this battle is said by hollingshead in his history of scotland p     to have been sought october the   th the year before  the following letter i am obliged to mr alderman reay of this town for sir pursuant to your request and my promise i have been with mr harle and have met with the passage you mentioned relating to newcastle in the    th page of the first vol of haluyts english voyages etc printed at london      fol by which it appears that the town of newcastle assisted k edw iii with    ships and     men against the french a most authentic and convincing proof of the great naval strength of that town in those days  another earlier instance of its being a town famous for trade in edward ii s time is to be found in p     and     of the said vol where we meet with an order of the king and council for the staple to be holden at a certain place this order relating to the exportation of wool is directed to the collectors of custom for wool and woolen fells in the port of london the title of it runs thus de stapula tenenda in certo loco ordinatio anno    edwardi secundi and the order itself thus rex collectoribus custumae canarum and pellium canutarum in portu london salutem ending with these words test rege apud doveram decimo octavo die junii per ipsum regem and consilium and immediately after is subjoined as follows et postmodum per breve de privato sigillo eodem modo mandatum est collectoribus custumae praedictae in portubus subscriptis videlicet in portu villae southampton in portu villae weymouth in portu villae sancti botolphi in portu villae kingstone super hull in portu villae de novo castro in portu villae de magna iernemutha in portu villae de lenne in portu villae de gypwico where you see newcastle is numbered among the greatest ports of the nation at that time  it would be as fatiguing as it is unnecessary to transcribe at length the said order which must therefore be omitted as well as the long roll of the english fleet contained in the         and   0 pages of the said book i shall only tell you that the account of the fleet is thus inscribed  the roll of the huge fleet of edward iii before calice extant in the kings great wardrobe in london whereby the wonderful strength of england by sea in those days may appear  this list is divided into the south and north fleet the beginning and end of both which i will give you in the authors own words the south fleet the kings ships    the kings mariners     london ships    london mariners     etc sum of the south fleet ships     sum of the south fleet mariners    0 the north fleet bamburgh ships   bamburgh mariners   newcastle ships    newcastle mariners     etc sum of the north fleet ships     sum of the north fleet mariners        i cannot leave this list without observing to the great honor of that loyal and brave town that newcastle is not exceeded in its number of ships by any one of all the    ports named in the said enrolment of the north fleet yarmouth alone excepted and how can it possibly detract from the glory of newcastle to be then outdone by yarmouth when which is very surprising that same great yarmouth in norfolk fitted out a vastly greater number both of men and ships than london itself the great metropolis of the kingdom furnished his grace with for the memorable siege of calais where he i mean king edward iii and his son the black prince acquired such renown to the english as will render themselves and the english nation famous to succeeding ages  there is one thing more i must take notice of before i conclude which is that the aforementioned fleet roll has no date i think it was about the year      when the english laid siege to calais though i cannot certainly tell not having an english history by me at present this is all i can find upon a cursory view of the book that has any relation to newcastle begging leave in the mean time to subscribe myself  sir your very much obliged humble servant john wilson alnwick dec            an christi mayors bailiffs      peter graper

acton bailiffs of the said town of newcastle had unjustly disseised john prior of durham from his free tenement in the said town of newcastle upon tyne after possession etc and it is enquired why they disseised him from thirteen marks and ten shillings the rent with the appurtenances etc  and peter and the others did not come and the sheriff declared that the foresaid hugh de angerton and hugh de carlel are dead and the foresaid peter is attached by henry glassen wright and thomas de newbigging and the foresaid john de emeldon by thomas de newbigging and thomas stele and the foresaid wiliam by thomas de newbigging and henry glassen wright therefore they are in mercy and let the aforesaid assise be taken against them by default etc  and upon this the aforesaid prior by his attorney says that our lord the king now reigning by his charter because he heard from the testimony of those whom he credits that our lord edward lately king of england his father had in his life by word of mouth granted to the monks dwelling in the island of farneland near bamburgh which island is a cell of the priory of durham ten quarters of corn and two tuns of wine to be received every year by the hands of the mayor and bailiffs of newcastle upon tyne as an alms of his said father for ever and that this grant was not duly put in execution in the lifetime of his said father nor confirmed by any of his letters our present lord the king for the health of the soul of his father being willing to fulfill and continue his will in this part has granted to the aforesaid monks as a compensation of the aforesaid corn and wine thirteen marks and ten shillings to be received every year at the feast of st michael by the hands of the mayor and bailiffs of the said town of newcastle upon tyne then being from the fee of the said town namely five marks for every tun of wine and five shillings for every quarter of corn to be paid to the said monks and their successors dwelling in the foresaid island as his alms for ever and he produces in court the foresaid charter of our present lord the king which testifies this etc and he prays assise let an assise therefore be taken etc  by a recognition of the aforesaid assise they say upon their oath that the aforesaid prior was seized of the foresaid rent with the appurtenances till the foresaid peter and others disseised him to the loss of the said prior forty one pounds thirteen shillings and four pence it follows therefore that the aforesaid prior may thence recover his seisine against those by a sight of the recognition of the assise aforesaid and

year as a sower of sedition among the queens subjects here the archbishop examined him he acknowledged he was ordained by cardinal pole but said that he was fallen off from rome and that he was a preacher of the gospel but that he had no license to preach from any of the bishops since the reformation and when the archbishop asked him if he had no such license how any could be assured that he was not of the romish church he would prove that by his prayers and sermons wherein he had spoken against rome and the pope as much as any of the clergy and he pretented that it was license enough to preach to have the spirit which he said he had when the archbishop again demanded whether that could be the spirit that complied not with the orders of the church lately purged and cleansed from idolatry he replied he endeavored to make the church purer than it was this man had a congregation that followed him which he termed men of tender consciences and with them he prayed and preached and administered the sacrament when he preached in public he would be absent till the divine service were over for the english liturgy he could not away with and then he could come into the church and preach  after his former examination and giving bail for his farther appearance he found opportunity to escape beyond sea telling his congregation that he was warned of god to travel abroad to instruct protestants in the other parts of the world and would come again to them leaving these as his last words to them that spiritual prayer was the chief testimony of a true protestant and that the set form of prayer was but the mass translated and so praying with them and getting money from them to bear his expenses in many tears he parted from them and was afterward seen in the low

be in ordine ad spiritualia whereto he answers in writing to the first part affirmatively in spiritualibus but whether in temporalibus he is not obliged to answer to any but a judge of controversies in religion the pope or one of his authority   whether the pope has a power to depose kings after their excommunication and in particular his majesty to this he answered he will not declare but to a lawful judge of religion   whether the pope has power to excommunicate kings such as are not of his church as his majesty to this he answered affirmatively and that all people baptized are under the popes power   whether it be no murder to kill the king so deposed   whether he has power to assoil subjects from the oath of their allegiance to his majesty to these he answers ut supra  he railed at the oath of allegiance as damnable and treasonable against god so became unworthy of mercy and ordered to prepare for his trial and the evening before it began was told that he was not to be tried for any thing relating to his religion but for his former answers to the questions which he may recall and crave mercy this he utterly refused upon his trial he protests not to acknowledge the judges nor judgment lawful the king to have no authority but derivative from his predecessors who acknowledged the popes jurisdiction if the king will be to me as they were to mine he shall be my king if otherwise i value him not and that i repent only for not having been so busy as i should in that which you call perverting of subjects and i call saving of souls i do decline the kings authority and will do it still in matters of religion most of your ministers maintain it and if they be wise will continue in that mind his insolent speech was shortened by the jurors quick return who found him guilty and he had sentence of treason and to stop his raillery he was after noon the same day hanged at glasgow  he was a desperate second ravillae and ready in that devilish doctrine of deposing and dethroning kings which he urged the more he said as consonant to the kir ministers tenets and that nothing troubled him but to be taken away ere he had done that which all scotland and england should

alighted off his horse and went through the river tweed on foot so zealous did he still seem for the cause the army advancing unmolested through northumberland came to newburne upon the river tyne four miles above newcastle opposite to which the lord conway was advantagiously posted with  000 foot and   00 horse able to have made a sufficient resistance the armies being in view lesley sent a messenger to the lord conway desiring leave tp pass with a petition to his majesty to which answer was returned that he might have liberty to pass with a few but not with his army upon which lesley commanded  00 horse to ford the river which they did but were soon forced to retire by the musketeers from behind an intrenchment which lesley perceiving played so furiously upon it with his cannon that the soldiers soon abandoned their post threw down their arms and fled whereupon the scots cavalry advance again and are entertained by commissionergeneral wilmot who gallantly charged them back into the river but these were overpowered by numbers of the scots and being withal galled and annoyed by the scottish ordnance were forced to retire in disorder  00 english being slain and taken

this tragical event being reported at court the royalists were not so moderate in their consures as the king himself who only said that he had been very ungrateful to him yet he was sorry he had not time to repent  under these discouraging circumstances the earl of strafford met the english army at durham where he highly blamed the lord conway for the late dishonor after that he found it

faith upon it  august     there came letters this day of the scots marching away and that his majesty had prevailed with the parliament of scotland that their ordnance and ammunition should be left at newcastle to be conveyed to london        sir john marley knight henry maddison in this year just before the breaking out of the civil wars king charles i ordered the earl of newcastle william cavendish to securce the town of newcastle which was done though with much difficulty and then he caused tinmouth castle to be seized also rapin  in this year also leonard carr esquire an alderman of this place had the following articles exhibited against him by the commonwealth to each of which my authority has made a marginal remark which take as follows  i he the said leonard carr joined with sir john marley and others this first article is really true that he and about thirty more raised  00 l amongst them but they could not get one man to prove it in newcastle in lending money to the late king charles after he had left and deserted the parliament in the year       ii the said mr carr joined with sir john marley and other aldermen the truth of his article may appear under his hand in the common council chamber in disposing of  0  l out of the towns treasury which was lent and sent to the king accordingly at his first raising war against the parliament  iii he the said mr carr did join with sir john marley in laying an imposition of threepence upon every chldron of goals this article also may be proved his hand in the townss books at this day for maintaining of the garrison of newcastle and for satisfying of the sums of money taken up by sir john marley and others for the maintenance of the war against the parliament  iv the said mr carr being governor of the merchants company this may be proved under his hand in the merchants companys books  the several subscriptions were shown to the committee appointed by the council   acquainted them with the kings great want of money and pressed them to a contribution and thereupon a considerable sum of money was raised and sent away to his majesty  v he the said mr carr was appointed by sir john marley and others this is known to all the town and country as chief surveyor for the building of a fort in newcastle against the parliaments forces which he performed so well that for his merit they called it by his name carrs battery  vi he the said mr carr did this is certainly true and i can give oath of it the writing being his own hand by a writing under his own hand which was found at the storming of newcastle among the governors papers subscribe the earl of essex and the parliament of england traitors for taking up arms against the king  vii he the said mr carr upon the parliaments forces approaching newcastle this will be proved upon oath by the persons who owed the houses informations being given in already caused to be pulled down some houses in a place called sandgate to the utter undoing of the poor inhabitants  viii the said mr carr did join with sir john marley and others this mr carr confessed before major general hammond and i saw his hand to a peremptory letter in writing a letter to general lesley and the english commissioners positively refusing to deliver up the town when they in the parliaments name and for their use made demand thereof in writing  ix and further the answer he gave himself before his highnesss council to these articles i have seen courage failed him in the day of battle he was like man sinking who will catch at the smallest sinking reed to save his life however set aside a frailty too common still be looked upon as a lover of his king and country he the said mr carr was summoned before the committee for sequestration for his delinquency where he was upon his examination of the articles against him declared a delinquent and since that time before the committee confessed himself a delinquent and craved the honorable respects to him   this year in july the lord gray of wark and others were sent by the parliament to invite the scots once more to invade england who the following month sent the solemn league and covenant to them which was readily read in parliament and taken by the house of commons sept    in st margarets and oct    by the lords in westminsterabbey a sit prelude to their sanctified reformation and a proper imitation of that at munster      the same cuthbert carr      the same henry warmouth james cole robert ellison on the   th of january this year in a dismal snowy season the scots contrary to all faith and loyalty passed the river tweed at berwick accompanied by a select committee of their own and there met another from england who were to conduct and supply them in the most loving manner upon their conjunction was framed the general committee of both kingdoms and in effect became a united campparliament before the advance of the army by a trumpeter they sent a letter to sir thomas glenham and the rest of the commanders and gentlemen of northumberland at alnwick in which they insisted upon the solemn league and covenant and declared their wellweighed resolutions to prevent that imminent danger not only of corruption but of ruin which they saw evidently intended to the true protestant religion by the popish and prelatical faction and to rescue his majestys person and honor from the counsels of those whose ends are little better than popery and tyranny therefore they expected the concurrence of them and all others and if they met with any opposition the law of nature and their own reason would tell them what they are to expect with this letter they sent also a copy of the scotch declaration to give it the greater force and authority among the vulgar  the brave sir thomas glenham after a serious consultation with the officers and gentry how most to incommode the enemys march returned a sharp answer in which he and the rest declare that without the sight of that letter they could not have believed that the scottish nation or the present prevailing party in that nation would have attempted an invasion of england so contrary to the laws of god of nations and of both kingdoms but especially to the late act of pacification so opposite to their allegiance and gratitude to his majesty to that neighbourly love they pretend to that discreet care they should have of their own safety they declare that no order of committees whatsoever of men or angels could give power to make war against their natural sovereign upon the empty pretense of nameless evil counselors and for the english agents they could not believe them any commissioners lawfully authorized by the two houses of parliament or yet by the house of commons whence so many members were expelled by partial voting so many banished by seditious tumults so many voluntarily absent out of conscience where desperation want of opportunity to depart or fear of certain plunder were the chief bonds which held the little remnant together from dissipation where the venerable name of parliament was made a state to countenance the pernicious counsels and acts of a close committee  as to the scots they declare that no covenant whatsoever could justify such proceedings begun without any necessity or so much as provocation after answering their pretensions they desire them to consider that there must be an account given to god of all the blood which should be shed in this quarrel and since their insults were such that a vanquished nation could scarce endure from their conquerors they could not think they were grown so same as to desert there religion laws liberties and estates upon command of foreigners and to suffer themselves to be made beggars and slaves without opposition  these paperskirmishes had no other effect than to gain some little time for sir thomas glenham to draw his forces and artillery to newcastle for alnwick was not tenable besides he found several of the gentlemen of northumberland especially such as were allied to the lord gray of wark either for fear of the scotch or affection to their cause were very backward in opposing the enemy the scotch marched after him by slow and difficult marches by reason of the snow and floods and on the  d of february summoned the town of newcastle but finding they were not able to take the place after three weeks stay and some skirmishes they passed the river tyne on the   th of february and on the  th of march entered sunderland the marquis of newcastle general for the king in these northern parts having reinforced his army to about   000 horse and foot attended so near the scotch army and so intercepted their supplies that sometimes they had neither meat nor drink and were never possessed of above twentyfour hours provision but they colored over their necessity by keeping a solemn fast and pressing on toward durham for better quarters to stop their advancing on the twentythird of march the marquis drew up his army at hilton on the north of the river were the scots were drawn up on whitburn lizard a hill east from them adjoining to the sea so the armies faced each other and skirmished in parties the fieldword given by the marquis being prophetically enough now or never and by the scots in their assuming way the lord of hosts is with us the marquis not being able to force the scots to a battle retreated toward his quarters at durham and the scots followed slowly but could make no considerable advance till the lord fairfax and the rest of the parliament forces by a new diversion gave them opportunity to descend into yorkshire echard  in the same year after the city of york had surrendered to the parliament the three armies thought sit to separate the scottish army was ordered to march northwards and joining with the earl of calander who had entered england with  0000 scots laid siege to newcastle on the   th of august the siege lasted above two months and proved one of the most resolute in the kingdom all sorts of policy of peace and war by treaty by mines by assaults having been used to little effect the inhabitants resolving if possible never to fall into the hands of the scots but on saturday the   th of october the whole scotch army furiously set upon the town and having made three breaches after a tedious and bloody storm they at last mastered it sir john marley sir nicholas cole and sir george barker got into the castle where being forced by necessity they came to a capitulation and surrendered on the   th of the same month the town being taken by assault was sufficiently plundered but the surrendry proved of great importance to the city of london where the poorer sort of people for the two last years were almost starved for want of fuel coals having been risen to the price of   l a chaldron a price never known before that time echard  in this year the round tower under the moothall toward the sandhill called the half moon which was the old castle of monkchester was by sir john marley made use of to secure the river and keyside against the scots and the other castle he put into good repair which was very ruinous on the former he laid great guns for the use abovementioned and on the latter he laid great ordnance to beat off those guns which the scots had laid upon the banks of gateshead against the town and this he managed bravely for a long time for the scots began the siege about july and it was the   th of october before they could take it which they did by storm upon the day after st lukes day and it was  by the white friar tower and sandgate where the colliers of elswick and benwell were employed under one john osbourn a false rebellious scot to undermine the walls which they did and blew them up and so got and plundered the town and no marvel for they were accounted  0000 men and the townsmen were but in all   00 men wearied with continual watch and duty though men of great courage and sought it gallantly to the last for the newgate ward which was under capt cuthbert carr was taken by the enemy who entered at the asoresaid places and encompassed them before and behind and pilgrimstreet gate was maintained by capt george errington lieutenant william robson and ensign thomas swan who sought and killed very many they themselves not having one hurt until they were encompassed by the enemy before and behind and even then they would not parley with the scots who fought against them without but did capitulate with lieutenant colonel sinclair who loved and honored them and kept his agreement so well with them that not one of them was robbed of his clothes or money nor were any of his men suffered to give any evil word and it was the great blessing of god that in all that time there was not one man slain nor hurt although that company consisted of ninescore men all tradesmen and there were diverse sallies made out at that gate for it was the longest of all the gates of the town it being barrocaded and shut up and after they had surrendered and the enemy was called over at that breach they durst not approach but shot at their friends that called them and would not believe that the town was taken ms milbank  it is not improper to place here the lord humes relation of the conclusion of this siege in his letter to the lord chancellor of scotland with the rest of the commissioners at london  right honorable i should have gone into newcastle on thursday but was put off till friday by these obstinate miscreants especially the mayor of that town sir david hume john rutherford and i my self went in on friday at nine in the morning we had commission from general lesley and committees if we found real dealings to yield to honorable conditions  the mayor sir nicholas cole and sir george baker were treating with us they gave us big words do what we could they would not so much as come to speak of conditions of rendering up the town and after three or four hours debate all that we could draw from them was that they would think upon our propositions and return them within three or four days and that when all conditions were agreed upon they would give hostages to surrender in case relief came not in twenty days nor would they so much as write to the general their own propositions so that after our return we sent to the town these conditions forthwith to be accepted  that all officers should have liberty to stay or to march out in all honor with arms bagg and baggage to any garrison with a convoy within sixty miles and all others not soldiers shall have the like liberty the town to enjoy all their former liberties and charter with all manner of protection to the inhabitants from plunder freedom as any town subject to the parliament no free billeting imposed none to enter the town but only a competent garrison signed by the general with this caveat that they should send out hostages by eight of the clock the next morning for surrender of the town before monday the    of october instead of which they sent out to us a bitter invective letter though they knew all our batteries and mines were ready yet they boldly drew from us these enforcements therefore this morning the scots make three breaches and to spring four mines and so to fall on the breaches were made reasonable low before three a clock afternoon all mines played well and yet the town stood out obstinate my lord chancellours regiment and backelough s entered a breach at closegate the general of the artillery his regiment and that other of edinburgh s entered at nine under the white tower col stuart s and gask s regiments

niddery the master of cranston and the lord niddery had the fourth quarter who entered at two mines they within made their utmost opposition with great execution on us but we forced them and the mayor with others gentlemen of quality got to the castle more you shall have within a day or two  october         your lordships humble servant a hume   and presently upon this letter thanksgiving was made at london with hearty thanks to god for his great mercy in giving up the town of new castle in england to our brethren of scotland and the   th october the castle likewise surrendered with three hundred persons the lords crawford rea and maxwell were sent to edinburgh to be executed and the town being taken by a great slaughter was plundered to the full and the scots excused themselves that therein the parliament of england would be the better pleased thus was the town taken from the king after an obstinate and gallant defense and well may assume the motto bestowed upon it fortiter defendendo triumphans  newcastle the   th of nov      the committees declaration the committees of both kingdoms after many meetings and serious debates amongst themselves and the hearing of sundry persons well experienced in the collieries and coalworks about the town of newcastle and having taken into their serious consideration sundry propositions for the good of those works and the driving on of that trade for the benefit of the parliament and the pay of the army have at length concluded and agreed amongst themselves that some of the most notorious delinquents and malignants late coalowners in the town of newcastle should be wholly excluded from intermeddling with any shares or parts of collieries or interest in any coals whatsomever that formerly they have laid claim unto and that the rest of the said delinquents deserve not to have any benefit of the said coals or collieries but in regard the delinquents and malignants belonging to those collieries were very many in number they did not conceive it for the service of the parliament or the army to put them all out at once and so to hazard the retarding of the present setting on of the works and ruining of the same in regard they were furnished with materials and utensils and had things ready at hand and did best know where to find workmen which strangers would have had difficulty to find and could not possibly on the sudden sufficiently provide themselves to set on the works and having made trial to let some delinquents collieries and for this purpose having treated with some wellaffected persons what profit might be raised and how they might be let for the most benefit to the parliament were constrained for the present rather to make use of those delinquents in working their own collieries as tenants and servants to the parliament than to engage our friends upon incertainties and hazard their loss as our own hindrance in setting forward the works for the use and benefit of the parliament wherefore the committees of both kingdoms seeing the necessity of dispatching away the ships that every day call upon us for their lading and lie at charges in expectation of getting coals for their money have thought fit to make the following declaration to all but such as are expected as beforementioned and whose names are hereafter written   st that for the present time there be allowed on the behalf of the rest of the late coalowners  0 s sterling upon every chaldron of shipcoals for desraying the charges in the works underground carriage thereof to the staiths and from thence in keels to the ships paying the towndues as was formerly paid viz   d for the town and   d for the garrison per chalder and the usual and accustomed rents for the pits and as a competent consideration for the support of the said late owners themselves and this allowance is made as well for the coals at the staiths and pits ready wrought as those to be wrought the said owners collieries and workmen being always obliged to set on foot with all diligence and maintain their coalworks make ready their keels and all other necessaries sit for the same and the coalworkers who are to receive the benefit of payment as abovesaid for their work out of the coals already above ground are obliged to continue in working the said coals at the ordinary rate and conditions as was formerly accustomed and whatsoover more price the said chalders of coals being sold to merchants or masters of ships shall yield above the said  0 s per chalder together with what custom and impost is or shall be put upon the same and the old custom of   s upon the chalder formerly paid by the owners to his majesty to be employed for the pay and maintenance of the army upon account to the parliament of england or their committes   dly that the coals already wrought aboveground either at pits or staiths belonging to friends have like allowance of  0 s upon the chalder they paying the said towns duties viz   d to the

lowest ebb he upon some assurances of protection from the scots then besieging newark repaired to their army and immediately gave orders to the lord bellasis to surrender newark which might have held out several months longer which done the scots army before they could have received any orders from the parliament with uncommon expedition marched with him to newcastle where they arrived may the   th about the middle of july the parliament sent their commissioners the earls of pembroke and suffolk of the peers and sir walter earl sir john hippisley robert goodwin and luke robinson esqrs for the commons with  0 propositions for his majesty to assent to  see rushworth demands of such a horrid and destructive nature as would if granted have rendered the king and his memory inglorious and despicable both at home and abroad the king perceiving all things tending to his ruin he seemed to hearken most to his old false friend william murray of the bedchamber who privately proposed an escape and offered to make his way and to have a ship in readiness to transport his majesty beyond sea the project appeared plausible and the king had disguised himself for it but was discovered in the attempt whether he was faithful to his majesty in this point is uncertain since sir robert murray was concerned in it but bishop guthry says it was divulged before the set time so that there was no discourse throughout the army but of murrays plot to carry away the king thereupon a guard of soldiers was immediately planted at his chamber door both within and without by which his majesty was not only deprived of liberty but also of quiet and retirement and having an antipathy against tobacco was much disturbed by their bold and continual smoking in his presence a military presage of the same heathenish barbarity at going to the block before whitehall  upon his majestys entry into newcastle he was caressed with bonfires and ringing of bells drums and trumpets and peals of ordnance but guarded by  00 of the scottish horse these near him bareheaded he lodged at general levins quarters who proclaims that papists or delinquents should not come near his person  and that although his majesty was present yet all men whatsoever should yield obedience to the ordinance of parliament  the scotch army are now they imagine masters of all by their power of the kings person and levy intolerable taxes and assessments upon all northern counties which very coursely resent them and complain to the parliament at westminsters not without some rising of the people standing upon their guard and all the scotch horse formerly sent into scotland are returned into yorkshire which makes the house of common debate and vote that this kingdom had no further need of the army of our brethren the scots in this kingdom and that the sum of  00000 l should be advanced and paid to that army as follows viz  0000 l thereof after their surrendering of newcastle carlisle and other english garrisons possessed by them in england and the other  0000 l after they are advanced into scotland and order shall be taken for payment of their arrears  and forthwith mr alexander henderson the scots apostolic minister and one of their commissioners was sent from westminster to newcastle to dispute with the king and to convince him to the covenant where after several discourse and meetings the king is pleased to descend so low as to argue reasons by writings which continued several encounters by papers till the   th of july concerning church matters by authrity of the fathers and practice of the church which henderson would avoid by texts of scripture and from thence his own opinion should guide him beyond all universal consent or practice of the primitive church which were erroneous which was not contradicted by orthodox learned men in the times of the first practice as is easily percieved that these desections were some of them justly called rebellions which henderson mentions and lastly that alleit he never esteemed any authority equal to the scripture yet he thanks the numerous consent of the fathers and the universal practice of the primitive church to be the best and authentical interpreters of gods word and consequently the purest judges between him and henderson until better may be sound as for example he says i think mr henderson the best preacher in newcastle yet i believe you may err and possibly a better preacher may come but till then i must retain my opinion cr  these disputes are in print which shows his majestys temper and knowledge to treat so long with a peevish presbyter  only the king was rid of one troublesome guest mr henderson who had been disputed into so much reason and understanding that being convinced by the king he fell into some distemper at newcastle and therefore was sent home to scotland where he died perfectly reconciled to the kings affairs and an apostate from the scots army and their proceedings sandersons hist of k charles i p  0   0       the king gives earnest of his sincere intentions of holding a personal treaty with the parliament of london by sending the following warrant  having designed to comply with the designs of our parliament in every thing that may be for the good of our subjects and leave no means unattempted for removing of differences between us therefore we have thought the more to evidence the reality of our intention of settling a happy peace to require you upon honorable conditions to quit the towns castles and forts entrusted to you by us and to disband all the forces under your several commands given at newcastle the  0th of june       to our trusty and wellbeloved sir thomas glenham sir thomas tisby colonel washington colonel blague governors of our cities and towns of oxford worcester litchfield and wallingford and to all other commanders of any other towns castles or forts within the kingdom of england or dominion of wales the scots now in some jealousy how mightily the king complies with his parliament and that they should not be able perhaps to effect their designs by force endeavor it by fraud and cunning by insinuating to the parliament that their conscience bears them witness of their constant endeavors to preserve the union of both kingdoms yet never more than since the kings coming to their army by effecting such messages from his majesty as might be a sure ground of peace to his people and happiness to himself and although we have not as yet prevailed over his principles deeply rooted in him as to obtain the utmost of our desires which we hope in a short time to effect and we hope that accordingly the parliament will be pleased to send their propositions of peace to him upon whose answer we shall clearly know how to proceed in the intendedpacification and to satisfy the parliament in disbanding our armies delivering up the garrisons possessed by us and retiring home for the good of both kingdoms  this was dated at newcastle the  0th of june      and signed by general levens and all the scotch commissioners and directed to the parliament  after many alterations and disputes between the scots and the parliament relating to the king it was at last agreed to deliver him up upon their being paid  00000 l for their arrears whereupon the two houses at westminster sent of the lord the earl of pombroke and donbigh and lord montague of the commons sir john holland sir walter earl sir james harrington sir john cook sir john crew and major general brown together with some private gentlemen and two of their chaplains mr marshall and mr caryl to receive the king these arrived at newcastle the   d of january and on saturday january the  0th a day of the kings imprisonment and martyrdom two years after they set out from newcastle with the king for holmby house in northamptonshire where he arrived february the   th the same day that the king left newcastle the scots also departed from it and marched into their own country passing over the tweed on the   th of february after they had continued a little above three years in the kingdom of england echard  a little after the kings coming to newcastle a scotch minister preached boldly before him and when his sermon was done called for the   d psalm which begins  why do thou tyrant boast thy self thy wicked works to praise whereupon his majesty stood up and called for the   th psalm which begins  have mercy lord on me i pray for men would me devour the people waed the minisiters psalm and sung that which the king called for whitlockss memoirs p       feb   the scotch army marched toward scotland well satisfied with the produce of their long stay in england and not displeased with the money paid by the parliament for delivering the kings person to the commissioners of parliament      thomas ledger robert young dec   the kings concession voted satisfactory whereupon the next day many members are imprisoned or secluded by the army  to the high court of parliament the humble petition of the mayor aldermen common council and the rest of the wellaffected of the town of newcastle humbly shows that we cannot but deeply resent what has been presented to you by the wellaffected in the southern parts as concerning the present treaty that if after all the experience of the mischiefs which have happened unto us from former treaties of all gods wonderfully owning of you both formerly and of late in midst of so many oppositions from all hands and of all his gracious appearings the k his party you go on to treat before full and exemplary justice be done upon the great incendiaries of the kingdom the fomentors of and actors in the first and second war and the late bringing in of the scots we can expect nothing as the issue thereof but the sudden desolution of parliament and army desolation of all the wellaffected the involving the nation in more blood misery and slavery then ever  may it therefore please you in this conjuncture of time to hearken to your petitioners who have constantly adhered to you and before you conclude this treaty to extend importance and speedy justice upon the greatest offenders wherein you cannot want

commonalty of this town did most freely and unanimously join in a petition to the house of commons for speedy and impartial justice upon the great incendiaries betwixt these two kingdoms and the chief promoters of this election who have already confessed themselves guilty of all the blood which has been shed by this unnatural war who have been twice conquered by us and this we ground upon our solemn league and covenant to which we have always adhered and by which all delinquents ought to be brought to condign punishment without exception though our treaties have upon what grounds we know not nor are not yet satisfied admitted of a personal treaty with the chief of them as if after twice conquered he or his party was sensible thereof and of whom as we yet hear of any conviction of conscience or judgment but only for an opportunity to cut the throats of us and all others that have engaged against them in this nation and being so unhappy that we could not by any means obtain their judgment thereof or intentions thereupon it has added many sad fears and thoughts to our former perplexities and even astonshed us to consider how our bondage and ruin is by this treaty since our petition so just rational and in prosecution of our covenant and their own proceedings should appear unworthy of the least respects or consideration and therefore we must still endeavor to keep our first integrity without spott and blemish for if we would never bow the knee to baal at the kings command we will never do it at the parliaments and if they act against the truth reposed in them by the people the people are bound in conscience and duty to act against them salus populi being suprema lex the lord direct us for his glory and the good of the poor commons of england who are like to be bought and sold because they are ignorant of their own freedom and birthright which they are willing to sell for a mease of pottage so they may enjoy a slavish peace though it has cost much

had any information and have convicted several persons upon the late act against conventicles and taken care to prevent these meetings under pretense of worship by employing the churchwardens to give information in case they could discover any we do take the late statute against conventicles to be in force and shall be always ready to proceed to punish offenders against it and if any offenders have not been punished it was for want of evidence to convict them and if those persons that informed your lordship would have been pleased to have acquainted us we would have taken away all cause of

that you declare your readiness to put the laws in execution against conventicles and unlawful assemblies for pretended religious worship in that town whereinto both you and my self are in this case entrusted to have a particular and diligent inspection but on the other side i am sorry to hear from you that you have had neither any information nor any evidence given you against such unlawful assemblies in your town when the notoriety of the fact by their numerous meeting at your barberchirurgeon s hall upon all saints day last being sunday the  st of november was such that it was voicd and made known to all the town and country about notice being also taken what special psalm or new rejoicing song they then chose and applied to themselves as holy saints of bearing a doubleedged sword in their hands to bind kings in chains and lords in iron bands of which notorious and unlawful meeting both my self and diverse others here at this distance were shortly after informed and i took the best care i could thereupon to have an address made unto you mr mayor by a special person under my episcopal jurisdiction to desire you that you would not suffer any such scandalous and offensive meetings to be held among you contrary to the known laws of this church and realm of england and greatly endangering the public peace thereof and this i did before i acquainted his majesty

you had or might have had knowledge and if you had not you will give me leave to say without offense that many of your townsmen are very backward in discovering to you and arresting their knowledge of such disorderly assemblies and that you are very great strangers to the affairs and disturbances of your own town the government whereof under his majesty is committed to your care  it is well taken that as you write you have proceeded and convicted several of these disobedient persons already and that you will take care to prevent their meetings against law for time to come which good resolution being observed by you will highly please his majesty and express the duty that we owe to his laws and the good government of this realm otherwise if we any ways neglect to do herein what belongs to us

heartily sorry to hear still the contrary which cannot be otherwise as long as the ringleaders of the factious are suffered to walk at liberty so expressly contrary to the act    carol    which lies before you to which the kings late proclamation ought to have given fresh vigor i would fain vindicate the town of newcastle from the foul imputation of being the nursery of faction in these northern parts which as things now stand i cannot do but rather must and according to my duty will report the contrary to the king and his council and then any one may easily foresee the evil consequences out of my special respect to your town and corporation i forbear still in expectation of a speedy account that both the act of parliament and the kings proclamation in this behalf are really obeyed that is duly executed if as i hear any of the seducers pretend they have subscribed and taken the oath required by the act    car ii i desire you would speedily send me their certificates mean while i hope

that purpose i doubt not of your acceptance of this my motion in order to his admission at st andrews by my episcopal authority and whereas i was lately informed that mr bonner had declined this place at st andrews i have now since that time certainly understood that he is not only willing but desirous to attend that cure and with all diligence to bestow his care and pains upon it which desire of

that st nicholas is the mother church but rather the contrary as above secondly it is notorious that the do and chapter of carlisle have refused to repair the chancel of st nicholas and particularly to allow the late deans accounts who de facto once repaired it so that the case put to dr exton differing essentially from this his opinion which is allowed to be good law cannot reach this  the impropriators of the parish of gosforth may be soon satisfied though it was once denied them from the authorities formerly sent that impropriators as well as the parson de communi jure ought to repair the chancel unless they can prove contrary by custom or composition  dr smith dean of carlisles letter to dr basire reverend sir cockermouth jan         upon reading of your paper which you sent enclosed to my lord our bishop touching the repairs of gosforth chapel i presently observed that the authorities therein quoted are indeed very clear and full as to the repairing of the mother church but reach not at all to chapels the burden whereof i have always been told did lie wholly upon the inhabitants within each such chapplery the parson or impropriators being no way liable thereunto however for my better satisfaction i wrote to a friend of mine in london and requested him to consult some able civilian about it and send me down his opinion the quaere which i sent up was expressed in these very words  whether an impropriator be obliged of common right to repair and uphold the chancels not only of the mother church but of all the chapels likewise within the rectory and whether the distinction of chapels parochial and chapels of ease make any difference in the case  the person consulted was dr exton chancellor to the bishop of london whose opinion under his own hand i here send you enclosed hoping it will give you satisfaction or if not that you will please to let me know that so we may consider what is further to be done  with my true respects and service to your self and your lady craving the continuance of your good prayers i remain ever  sir your faithful servant tho smith  dr extons opinion mentioned above the law is certain that where there is a mother church and a chapel of ease or a parochial chapel which makes no difference if the mother church be out of repair those inhabitants within the chappelries shall contribute toward the repair of that church but e contra neither the impropriator nor parishioners of the mother church shall at all contribute toward the repairs of those chapels except either they have done it and so suffered a custom to grow upon them or there be some reservation so to do it in the foundation of those chapels but those persons only that have the benefit of those chapels shall repair  tho exton  mr willoughby the bishops lessee for one moiety of the tithes did voluntarily before sequestration pay  0 l toward the reparation of the chancel and the sequestrators employed that  0 l and such portion of the tithes sequestered amounting to the value of  0 l more whereby the said chancel was soon repaired as it has been duly since that time   an christi mayors sheriffs      sir ralph carr michael blackett
