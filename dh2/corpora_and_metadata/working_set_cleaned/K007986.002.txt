account of the court of spain  part ii  on the feast of the annunciation the young queen went to the monastery of the incarnation the french ambassadors lady accompanied her thither but though she never so earnestly desired to have an opportunity to entertain her in private she could not find one single moment to do it for the vigilant camarera would not allow the queen that liberty at her return she served nine poor women at dinner and gave each of them a suit of apparel and sive pistols in their purse the maids of honor carried the dishes the queen mother performed the same ceremony on her side but what infinitely surprised the queen was to find a billet privately slipped into her pocket and thus superscribed for the queen alone  at first she was in doubt whether she ought to open it or no but presently after she had a mind to carry it to the king nevertheless the uncertainty of what was contained in it and after what manner the king might take it prevailed with her at last to open it it seemed to be written in a disguised sort of an hand and contained these words in spanish  the supreme elevation of your majesty and the mighty difference that is between us has not been able to efface that passion which your admirable qualities have infuted into my heart i adore you my queen i die in adoring you and i dare say that i am not unworthy to adore you i see you i sigh after you but you dont know my sighs you dont understand my secret languishings nay you dont turn your charming eyes upon me ah madam how unhappy am i to be born a subject who find my self possessed with the inclinations of the greatest king in the universe  the queen continued some time surprised and astonished she could not imagine who this rash person was that had the hardiness to write to her in these terms and did not question but that the billet was slipped into her pocket by one of the poor women whom she had served but then it appeared very strange that a man who seemed to be of great quality would trust his life for nothing less was hazarded into the hands of a poor needy creature for such she must be that could approach the queen that day it was true indeed that she had been amongst the religious women of the inearnation but although some of them might undertake this business yet there was little probability to be lieve it by reason of the consequences that would have proved fatal to the party concerned if ever the matter came to be discovered sometimes she thought that perhaps it might be a trick of the camarera mayor to see what use she made of this billet and then to acquaint the king with it and turn the most innocent thing in the world into a wrong sense after these different reflections at last she judged it would be the safest way to discover the matter to the queen mother and follow her advice she went the next day to dine with her and afterward showed her the letter beseeching her to keep it that if the king came to know any thing of the matter she would be so kind as to testify the whole truth the queen mother seeing that she was discomposed at it assured her that it was not worth the while to torment her self about it and from whatever hands the letter came if the king was disquieted at it she would take care to acquaint him with the truth so that the queen left her more at ease than she was before by reason of this assurance on this day the queen arrived to her eighteenth year she received the compliments of all the lords and the ladies made her presents particularly the queen mother who sent her a set of diamonds and turquoises at night there was a consort of french music at the palace  it was much about this time that the envoy of brandenburgh parted from madrid complaining and loudly threatening them with his masters resentments he came to receive several considerable sums which the elector had sent to the king of spain they had amused him a long time with many tedious delays but at last gave him an assignation to receive fifty thousand crowns of the silver that was daily expected from the indies when the flota was arrived he went to sevil but his journey had no success because they had ordered the president of the the contration is a council where they order all affairs relating to the indies contration at sevil to give him nothing he came back to madrid with all the fury imaginable to find himself treated with so little respect he renewed his importunities and they for their part renewed their promises at last he was so wearied with these continual delays whereby they still put him off that he demanded a positive answer and yet tarried longer than he had resolved but his master being informed of the whole proceedings ordered him to take his audience of leave the duke de medina celi would fain have stopped him promising to pay down fifty thousand crowns in four months and perhaps the envoy had stayed in expectation of them if he had not been otherwise ordered although there was little probability that he would have received satisfaction at the time appointed and so he refused this proposal then they offered him thirty thousand crowns in hand he was upon the point of accepting them when he was given to understand that this would be paid him no better than the rest this put him into a great passion which made him speak so fiercely and freely to the ministers that he did not spare them at all he showed several persons a letter from the elector of brandenburgh which was full of menaces for the rude treatment of his envoy the night before he parted they sent him a golden chain worth a hundred and fifty pistols but he returned it immediately back again to the person who brought it to him from the king the next day the same chain was brought to him the second time but he sent it back to the chief minister and told him he would rather say he had lost it upon the road than accept of a present that was so unworthy of the elector his master  on the other side the count de gubernatis envoy from savoy seeing that all his solicitations and instances for four years last past had not advanced his negotiation in the least and that all the hopes they gave him of granting the same honors to the ministers of the duke of savoy as they received in france were only dilatory illusions to amuse him without ever designing to perform them he departed from madrid in a great fury which was so much the greater because they refused to satisfy his demands in the payment of those subsidies that were due to his master some of the other envoys departed also with no less discontents and as for those that stayd behind they complained in their turns of the ill usage they had received but foreigners were not the only persons that were disgusted the subjects of the king of spain were little better used and the count de balbo with several milanese officers returned to italy without being able to obtain what was due to them or get the recompense they demanded it is indeed certain that the king had no funds that the price of victuals was not in the least diminished that many poor artisans and daylabourers died of hunger and that those men who were supposed to be rich had billets often sent to them to send their money to such and such places with great menaces to assassinate them in case they failed  another affair happened upon which the court had their eyes fixed for a long time and several persons of the highest quality found themselves interested in it by the means of the prince dstillano and the count de monterey the first of these possessed the place of president of the council of flanders at madrid it was taken from him by don juan of austria and conferred upon the count de monterey who had never taken possession of it the pretense they used to set by the prince de stillano was a quarrel raised for the purpose he had been banished but was afterward informed under hand that he might if he pleased come back to madrid so he fell into the snare and returned the k and don juan seemed to be very angry with him because he presumed to come back contrary to his majestys order and therefore to punish him they bestowed his place upon the count de monterey who at that time commanded the army in catalenia and after this usage were so far from revoking his sentence that they banished him to his old place the first thing the count did after he had been summoned to the court was to demand the oath of his office and the king promised to choose a convenient opportunity to receive him but the queen mother being informed of it by don geronimo deguya hindered the king from receiving the oath of the count de monterey because she had a kindness for the prince dstillano who was altogether devoted to her service the affair continued in this condition till the duke de medina celi was advanced to the ministry who assembled a juncto at cardinal portocareros palace to examine the reasons of one side and the other the cardinal presided in it and was assisted by the kings and qeeenmothers confessors by don benedetto and by don pedro gil del faro they gave the prince de stillano to understand that since his majesty had disposed of his place in favor of the count de monterey he had nothing left him to do but only to submit to this the prince answered that by an ancient law of castile the king could not take away his place without commencing a process against him upon this the juncto broke up but at their second meeting concluded that it was in the kings power to dispose of this office who having a great inclination to the count had decided it in his advantage whilst the prince de stillano continued thus outed the queen mother was sensibly concerned at the injustice that was done to one of her principal servants and she was persuaded as well as the rest of her family that they could reproach him with nothing but his faithful adhering to that princess he still persisted in his demands to have his trial come on that since they had taken away his place from him as from a criminal they ought to treat him as one and punish him according to his faults all the queenmothers faction joined in the same complaints but that did not hinder the count de monterey from continuing still in her place it is true that considering him personally he was more deserving than the prince de stillano that he had faithfully served the king in flanders when he was governor there at a time when affairs were in a ticklish condition he is a wellmade agreeable person of great abilities and we ought to reckon amongst his other good qualities his alliance with the duke de medina celi and this was no small consideration at a time when the duke did whatever he pleased at court for example he nominated his brother to be viceroy of mexico which is a post where they get a prodigious wealth in a short time  the president of the council of castile received about this time a breve from the pope whereby he was enjoined to repair immediately to rome to give an account of his behavior toward the nuncio but they were of opinion here that he was not obliged to obey it it was known at madrid that the visitorgeneral of the kingdom of naples had sent word to the duke de saintangelo dean of the collateral council to depart out of naples within three days and to retire sixty miles off he obeyed this injunction after having taken his leave of the vice roy and the most considerable persons of the city and afterward went to gaette with his whole family the viceroy who appeared in favor of him was very glad that the city of naples had writ to the king of spain about him with a great deal of zeal and affection the visitorgeneral enraged at the course they had taken sent orders immediately to the duke de monte sardo his son in law to the duke della regina his nephew and to all his other relations to be gone within an hour the luke della regina being a magistrate of the city pretended that he could not be hindered from staying in it he summoned his friends together and after he had represented to them the injury that was done to himself in particular he declared to them that the visitor had a design to attack them too in general as appeared by his severe examining the conduct of the princes and barons of that kingdom although by their privileges they were exempted from it twas resolved in this assembly to meet again the next day and accordingly a great number of people came there in short there came more than sixty who elected out of themselves the prince dotojano of the house de medicis the prince de la torella of the house of caraccioli and the duke de matalone of the house de caraffa they went to find out the viceroy who voluntarily engaged to speak to the visitor general but he coldly told him that he executed the orders he had received from spain hereupon the neapolitan lords were extremely dissatisfied and several of them wished that they had some chief or other to head them who was capable of a great resolution  for the better understanding of these memoirs i ought to acquaint the reader that the ambassadors and even the envoys had a certain right at madrid which exempted them from paying any toll at the city gates for those things that were necessary for their families this custom had been observed time out of mind but it being discovered that some persons had extended this privilege farther than it ought to be and that hereby the king suffered exceedingly in his dues the council judged it expedient to convert it into a sum of money which was in effect paid by the foreign ministers and the franquezas for so they call this right were abolished there was likewise another privilege which is called immunidad del barrio that is to say the ambassadors have a certain precinct marked out about their houses in which compass justice is not to be performed without their permission and the alcaldes dare not pass in the ambassadors quarter with their white rods which is the badge of their authority every ambassador is so jealous to preserve this privilege that some foreign ministers have been so hardy as to hang the alguasils at their gates when they found them trespassing in this point i must confess very few of them have carried things to this extremity but several have ordered them to receive an hundred blows with a cudgel  notwithstanding the apparent risque they run and the consequences that such infractions might carry the corrigidor accompanied with his officers passed at midday through the quarter belonging to our ambassador they carried with them their white rods but he not being informed of it till they were quite gone could only send to the corrigidor to tell him that he was extremely surprised at his procedure and that for the time to come he should remember his duty better he answered that he was ignorant till he was now better informed that the ambassadors quarter extended so far as the place through which he had passed and that it was sufficient he knew it now but notwithstanding this sort of satisfaction the very same corrigidor a few days after came by that way again and passed before the ambassadors house at a time when he was abroad the marquis de villars being informed of it complained loudly of this insolence  he expected with impatience what would be the result of the matter when an order from the king came to him wherein his majesty revoked the privileges of his quarter pretending it was not just that the ambassador of france should be more favorably treated at madrid than the ambassador of spain was at paris it was said at court that in that great city the officers of justice went when they pleased up to the very gates of the spanish ambassador to perform the functions of their respective offices that in the year      there was issued out a declaration of the same nature with this that the renewing of it was no novelty and that since the first declaration the ambassadors had only enjoyed this privilege by sufferance but that for the future they were resolved to connive at it no more  monsieur de villars answered that he owed too great a respect to the king ever to remove himself from it that he was assured the king his master would approve of the proposal to treat their ambassador as they did his in spain but then they ought to consider what privileges that minister has at the court of france that it was not necessary there to demand audience and permission which always retard affairs in order to speak to the king and queen to see them and accompany them that he went a hunting with the king that he assisted at feasts and other ceremonies as often as he pleased that he was allowed to have six horses to his coach and so to drive all about paris that the ambassadoris lady went in the queens coach that she sometimes dined with her and that she received several marks of distinction all which served to make an embassy pass very agreeable that it ought to be considered that he did not enjoy all these advantages at madrid and lastly that he would take care to acquaint his master with the declaration of his catholic majesty that he could not have an answer immediately by reason of the great distance and that it was but reasonable and just that things should continue in the old state till it arrived but the king of spain issued out a second declaration wherein it was said that his majesty persisted in his first resolution and that he thought fit to take away the immunities of the frenco ambassadors quarter without assigning any cause  it is indeed very surprising that monsieur de villars who had reason to promise himself very advantageous distinctions upon the queens account should be the only man who was singled out from the rest of the ambassadors to have his franchises taken away from him whilst the others enjoyed theirs as formerly he did not fail to send advice to the court of france of what had happened the king was sensibly concerned at his ill usage and promised to see justice done to him but monsieur desiring that things might not be carried to extremities neither on one side nor the other writ a letter to the queen his daughter wherein he signified to her his great trouble and inquietude about this affair he conjured her to use all her interest with the king her husband to engage him to do his most christian majesty justice she was kept ignorant till this very moment of what had passed and was no less surprised than afflicted at it she took occasion to discourse the king about it at a favorable juncture as she imagined but he answered her coldly enough that it was a long time ago since this affair had been regulated and that he would dispense with himself for telling her the reasons she earnestly importuned him to acquaint her with them and after infinite solicitations he could only be brought to reply as follows  esque me quiteram este embaxador y me embiaram otro gavacho which signifies in our language let them take away this ambassador from me and send me another in his room  it is easy to judge that the king speaking in these terms was not only prejudiced against the marquess de villars but also against any other that might be sent to him whatsoever entreaties the queen made to oblige him to settle matters in the estate they were formerly yet he continued still inflexible and seemed indeed to act in this affair rather by another spirit than his own without making any reflection either he or his council that france would resent the injury but they awaked  of their lethargy when they saw an extraordinary courier arrive on the   th of april to the marquess de villarss house they had terrible apprehensions upon them that he brought a declaration of war along with him and the suspicions they had entertained a long time from the side of italy sensibly alarmed them our ambassador had audience of the duke de medina celi to demand the reestablishment of his franchises and the jurisdiction of his quarter he represented to him the hardship of his usage and the little reason they had to treat him after this manner and to choose him from amongst the rest to be affronted that the king his master was never the aggressor but that he would not tamely suffer an injury without revenging it that particularly he was sensible of this and demanded public satisfaction for it  the duke alleged as he had done before that ever since the year      the king of spain was resolved not to grant the franchises to the ambassadors any longer but that the relaxation which time causes in every thing was the reason that the foreign ministers by little and little recovered their former rights that this was no good consequence why it should take place of the law and for a testimony that they had no intention to disgust him in this particular he might rest assured that for the time to come all the other ambassadors should be treated after the same manner  to this the marquess de villars made answer that instead of finding any particular satisfaction for himself he met with a new subject of complaint upon the score of this general conduct that since the new alliance that was contracted between the two crowns the natural right warranted him to expect that the ambassadors of one would easily merit favors of the other and even procure them for their friends that he was so far from meeting that usage that he could get nothing for them but affronts but that this was not the thing he demanded that as for the declaration of     he was not obliged to take the least notice of it since having been ambassador at madrid near four years ago he peaceably enjoyed all those privileges which now they design to retrench him of under the pretense of that declaration  he was not content with discoursing the chief minister about this affair but demanded audience of the king and immediately obtained it so he presented to him his letters of credence to have this affair regulated and said every thing that was necessary to engage him to make necessary reflections upon a thing that might draw after it such evil consequences he reminded him of the peace that was so lately sworn and of the marriage he had contracted with a princess of the bood of france and told him what little occasion he had to disgust the most christian king that in truth his master believed he did not act by his own inclinations and that upon this consideration he was disposed to receive the satisfaction he had so much reason to promise himself on his part the king of spain only answered with we will see veremos according to his usual custom  after this it was deliberated in council what was necessary to be done in the business the council gave their advice to the chief minister and he to the king as is the way in spain at last a resolution was taken up that the marquess de los balbazez who had been named to go commissary to the ambassador in france should give him satisfaction in pursuance to this order he went to the palace of the marquess de villars and presented to him a paper that was signed wherein was represented in terms full of amity and respect that the king of spain had given necessary orders to his ambassador to give that answer and satisfaction to his most christian majesty which he had demanded in his letter and that he came to assure him that the king his master had so great a regard to all the motives of friendship that united their majestys that he would still continue the ambassador of france in all the privileges and immunities of his quarter and that he should likewise have the right of the franchises paid to him that if he had them not till this present it was only occasioned by his own neglect to demand them and that the king had never any design to take them away from him  it is a thing seldom practiced in other courts to begin actions of this nature unless they have had an important occasion to do it and afterward to abandon them with an easiness which may in some measure be attributed to their great weakness but there are some places where this conduct is more in request than others and the court of spain is one of them some persons were even persuaded that this design of taking away the ambassadors privileges was executed by the ministers only out of a principle of revenge because our king had sent word to the duke de giovenezzo that he was willing to give him at his court all the advantages that belonged to the character of the ambassador of spain wherewith he was invested but that he had no intention to leave him those liberties which he allowed to others and he had a particular reason to observe this conduct with him for it is very wellknown that when he was in the quality of envoy at the court of savoy he had busied himself without any provocation to put them upon the design of burning the vessels of toulon and the magazines of pignerol so that the king having very just reasons to look upon him as a particular enemy it was natural enough to deny him those favors that are allowed to those persons for whom we have an esteem however it was if the court of spain was at the bottom mortified at this matter they took care not to make it appear and to take away from our king an ambassador who was by no means agreeable to him they immediately named the marquess de la fuente to go and supply his place the queen was extremely satisfied to see the business of the franchises terminate as she desired  the king who loved her tenderly notwithstanding all those secret enemies that did her ill services with him knowing that one of her greatest diversions was to ride a hunting ordered three fine horses to be brought to her from andalusia she chose one of the most mettlesome and mounted him but she was no sooner got upon his back but he began to caper and was very like to have thrown himself backwards upon her when she fell one of her feet unluckily happened to hang in the stirrup and the horse finding this embarras ran about very furiously and dragged the poor queen after him to the extreme peril of her life this accident happened in the court of the palace the king beholding her from a balcony was brought to the last despair and though the court was full of persons of quality and the guards yet no one durst offer to go and help the queen because it is not lawful for any body to touch her and especially by the feet unless it be the chief of her menins or pages who puts on her chiopins these are a sort of sandals into which the ladies put their shoes and make them appear very tall the queen always supports her self upon one of her menins when she walks any where but these were children too small to rescue her from the danger wherein she was at last two spanish knights one of whom was named don louis de las torres and the other don jaime de sotomayor resolved whatever might happen to deliver her so one of them caught hold of the horse by the bridle and stopped him the other took hold immediately of the queens foot took it out of the stirrup and put one of his fingers out of joint in doing her this piece of service but without tarrying a moment away they went to their houses and presently ordered their horses to be saddled to escape the kings indignation the young count de pannaranda who was a friend to both of them approached the queen and told her very respectfully that those gentlemen who had been so happy as to save her life were yet in fear of losing their own she had the goodness to speak to the king in their favor because as i mentioned before no body was permitted to touch her and particularly by the feet the king who came down immediately to see in what a condition she was testified an extraordinary joy to find she was not hurt and very kindly received the request she made in behalf of these generous criminals word was immediately sent to them who by this time were got on horseback to save themselves the queen honored them with a present and ever after had a particular consideration for them  a few days after this accident had befallen the young queen she received a small disgust from the king upon this occasion she had a very pretty spaniel with her and the little creature used to lie with her a nights the queen happening to miss her one night got out of her bed and groped up and down the room for her the king too finding the queen was not in bed got up likewise to find her behold them now in the midst of a great chamber without any light going on one side and the other and rubbing their shins against every thing they met at last the king being impatient asked the queen why she got up the queen answered him to search for her spaniel and is it worth the while said he for a king and queen of spain to rise out of their beds to find a little pitiful bitch being thus vexed he spurned the poor reature with his foot as she came against his legs and was like to kill it at the cries she made the queen who loved the bitch could not forbear to complain in a sweet manner and came to bed again very sorrowful but neither the king nor she were able to find it again and they were forced to call up the queens women to bring them a light the next morning the king went out very early a hunting all alone without saying a word to the queen this disquieted her all day long and she past the greatest part of it leaning upon the windows of her chamber although the duchess de terra nova frequently disturbed her and told her that a queen of spain ought not to look out at a window all that day she impatiently expected the kings return and as soon as ever he lighted from his horse met him about half the staircase and threw her self about his neck with that agreeable french liberty which she had not yet forgotten he was perfectly charmed at it and could not forbear to embrace her often although it is not the custom in that country where their way of saluting the ladies is to press their arms with their hands he was in so good a humor that she obtained leave for the duke de ossone to come back to court and execute his place of great master of the horse  the juncta that was erected to determine the affair between the nuncio and don juan de la puente y guebarra president of the council of castile decided it on the   th of april he was entenced to be banished and turned out of his office the nuncio demanded of them that they would oblige him to go to rome to take off the suspension he had incurred but they thought they had punished him sufficiently abundance of people said that these great names he took upon him did not belong to him and that his true name was don juan de montefillo and that he was barely a gentleman of the province of castile he finished the course of his studies at salamanca and afterward was made canon of toledo his behavior mightily pleased the archbishop of toledo who was at that time cardinal of arragon and taking a delight in his conversation trusted him with the management of all his affairs he acquitted himself so well in this station that the archbishop took care to reccommend and make him known to don juan of austria whom he extremely pleased by the suppleness of his carriage and the vivacity of his genius and whether that prince had any particular designs upon him or only intended to prefer him to acquit himself of the promise he had made to the cardinal he made him president of the chancery of valladolid sometime after the count de villambrosa who was president of castile happening to die the prince gave his place to don juan de la puente to say the truth he only executed that office by a commission but it was a very great post and could not fail to draw the envy of several persons upon him and so it really did for few people were concerned at his misfortunes they looked upon him as one of the creatures of don juan and those that were always looking out for an object for their hatred when that prince was gone vented all their spleen and indignation upon him the people accused him of all their grievances and pretended that he was the cause of crying down the money that being in a place which rendered him chief of justice and the civil government he might if he had been so minded have found out some way or other to relieve so many different persons that suffered according to their condition but the complaints of private men nay even those of the public in general could not have been able to hurt him if there had not been a necessity at that juncture to oblige the pope by reason of the apprehensions they had of the designs of the most christian king upon italy  although the office of the president of castile is the next in dignity to that of the chief minister yet all people have not an equal desire to possess it don juan ascensio bishop of avila whom the king nominated to it refused it an order was sent to him to come immediately but he desired the duke de medina celi to excuse him and leave him in his diocese he had formerly been a religious of the mercy and general of his order however as it is a hard matter to resist the will of ones prince especially when it happens to be so advantageous as this was he obeyed the second order that was sent him and came without any delay he was a person of great discretion and it is certain a man cannot have too much to qualify him for the exercise of so considerable a place for the council of castile regulates all the affairs that respect the government of the states of castile it was first created in the year      by st ferdmand king of castile it is composed of a president and sixteen counselors the president never makes any visits and at his house gives the right hand to no body they summon to this council the chanceries of granada and vailladolid and the courts of judicature of sevil and gallicia which are the four seats of justice where they determine by way of appeal all the suits that are judged by the corrigidors in the cities and by the alcades in the villages when the king speaks of the council of castile he barely calls it our council  the court was exceedingly troubled at the advices they received that the viceroy of naples having with no small pains heaped together the sum of two hundred thousand crowns part of which he had borrowed to send to piombino portolongone orbitelle and some other places which the king of spain possesses on the coasts of tuscany the money being embarked in a folouque eight slaves found the opportunity to carry off the vessel two small vessels and a galley were sent after them to bring them back but they were gone too far to be recovered so all the pains of the marquess de losveles tended only to set eight slaves at liberty and enrich them for the remainder of their lives  the ambassador of venice seeing that he of france received satisfaction upon the occasion of the franchises and immunities redoubled his instances to have justice done him upon the alguazils who had killed two of his attendants he received satisfaction on the   th of april the alcalde who led them on was banished and the alguazils were sent to prison and were not enlarged but by his entreaty  if the count de monterey was sensibly affected with joy to be preferred to the prince de astallano as to the presidentship of flanders he was not a little disgusted to see several persons made counselors of state before him and notwithstanding he earnestly desired to be one of the number he was disappointed the king named the duke de albuquerque general at sea the count doropesa who was very young and had no other dignity as yet the marquess de los velez governor of naples the duke de villa hermosa governor of flanders don melchior navarra who had been formerly vice chancellor of arragon the marquess de mansera mayor domo major to the queen mother and the inquisitorgeneral to be members of this council it was commonly believed that the queen mother had a great influence in naming most of these lords the council of state was instituted by charles the fifth in      here it is that they examine the merits and services of those persons that pretend to be made vice roys or to possess any other great employments they regulate the most important affairs of the monarchy the king only is the president of it and the number of the counselors is not fixed  most people were surprised that don carlos ramirez de arrellano was made president of the finances on the  th of april after he had been so long chained and shut up for his lunacy and madness he was chosen in the room of don antonio de monsalve no body could imagine for what reason the duke de medina celi thought fit to trust him with a post of that consequence for he had none of those qualities that are necessary to make a man capable of discharging it well nay he had some that ought to have excluded him amongst the rest he was soninlaw to a corrigider named don francisco de herrera who was mortally hated by the people and it is said not without just grounds since he contributed not a little to the extreme miseries under which they groaned the council of finances which is there called de hazienda was established in the year   0  by philip iii it is their business to inspect the tribunal which is called the contaduria mayor and was set up by philip the second in       a certain accident happened at court which i cannot forbear to relate although it is of little consequence the queen had two of the prettiest parrots in the world which she had brought along with her from france and loved mightily the duchess de terra nova thought to do a meritorious work in killing them because they could only talk french one day when the queen was gone out to take a walk and the duchess to avoid going with her and to put this design in execution had pretended a slight indisposition she demanded the parrots of the woman that looked after them and so without any more ado as soon as ever she had got them into her hands wrung off their necks in spite of all the prayers and entreaties that were used to prevent her from killing them this was a great affliction to the poor french women that waited upon the queen who when she came back to her apartment commanded them to bring her parrots and dogs as her custom was always when the king was not there for he could not endure any of these little creatures because they came from france and whenever he saw them he cried fuera fuera peros frances that is to say out out you french dogs all the queens women instead of going to fetch what she demanded stared upon one another and continued for some time immovable without daring to speak a word but at last after a long silence one of them gave her an account of the execution which the camerera had made of them she was extremly concerned although she took care not to discover it but as soon as the duchess entered the room and according to her custom came to kiss her hand the queen without speaking a syllable to her gave her two boxes on the ear with her hand never was any thing in the world in such a rage and surprise as the duchess was for she was one of the most haughty imperious women living and carried as much state and grandeur she possessed as i mentioned before a kingdom in mexico and now to be buffeted by a young queen whom she had hitherto treated like a child this appeared insupportable she immediately flew out of the room saying all the impertinent things that her anger suggested to her and assembled together her relations and friends and above four hundred ladies with this numerous train of coaches she came to the kings apartment to demand justice of him for the affront she pretended she had received from the queen she made so great a clamor and shed so many tears that he sent for the queen to come to him and as he represented to her the high rank which the camarera mayor held in the world the queen interrupted him and told him without any hesitation senor esto es une antojo  these few unexpected words clearly changed the face of affairs the king embraced her with a thousand testimonies of joy adding that she had done very well and that if two blows were not enough to satisfy her he consented she should give the duchess two dozen more now antojo signifies in the spanish tongue the longing of a woman with child and they are it seems convinced by long experience that if women with child in that country have not what they desire and dont do what they have a mind to do they are delivered before their time of a dead infant the king who believed the queen was with child was ravished with joy and though he had a mighty kindness for the duchess yet he exceedingly approved of the queens action so that all the satisfaction she received from him was this cailla os est as bofetadus son hii as del antojo that is to say hold your peace these blows are the fruits of a woman with child the queen had so much prudence and address as not to take the least notice of the death of her parrots so that she left the king no room to imagine that the antojo of boxing the old duchess proceeded from her own resentments  the marquess de villa menrique obtained the viceroyship of peru which is one of the most considerable posts by the means of a pretty lady of whom the duke de medina celi was extremely enamored  the king the queen and the queen mother went together to buenretiro to pass the holy week there after easter was over the king expressed a great desire to go to aranjuez as it had always been the custom but the queen mother who had no inclinations to be at any great distance from madrid because all affairs were managed there and the counselors never stir out of it and likewise because the neighborhood of toledo where she had been formerly confined against her will revived a sort of horror in her raised so many obstacles that the king altered his mind so he stayed but a very inconsiderable time at buenretiro and passed four days at the escurial he would only suffer himself to be accompanied by the duke de medina celi the master of the horse one of the gentlemen of his bedchamber and the major domo the next day after he was arrived the queen wrote a very tender letter to him and sent him a diamondring he sent her by way of return a chaplet made of the wood of calambour garnished with diamonds in a little box of gold filagreen wherein he enclosed a billet that had only these words madam there has been a great wind i have killed six wolves  as soon as he returned to madrid the desire of going to aranjuez seized him again by a custom that had been established ever since the time of philip ii the kings of spain were used to go to this noble house some time after easter this is appointed in the ceremonial of the palace which is a rule they always follow in it are to be found all the ceremonies that are to be observed the habits which the kings and queens are to wear the time of their going to their royal houses how long they are to continue there the days of going to chapel as also those for bullfeasts and running at the ring the hour of their majestys going to bed and rising and a thousand other things of the same nature but as it happened there was so great a scarcity of money that the king was obliged to stay at madrid however to excuse and color so extraordinary a thing they gave out that the smallpox was at aranjuez which being situated upon the road to malago where the plague raged and from whence it might easily be spread thither his majesty was not willing to hazard himself so far as to venture thither  the court was troubled at the advices they received on the first of may that the fishermen of fontarabia and those of andaye had been lately engaged in a quarrel about the fishery of the river bidassoa which separates the two kingdoms they fought and several men were killed on both sides but what concerned them the most was that the governor of fontarabia instead of sending to part them played the cannon upon the french and demolished some houses in andaye so that to prevent the consequences which might perhaps have proved very dangerous they commanded him to repair the houses that were battered and give the french fishermen all the satisfaction they desired our ambassador assured them that he would write to his master and acquaint him with what readiness and complaisance this affair was made up at court  the duke de medina celi offered to make the marquess de villa franca counselor of state provided he would quit his place of lieutenant general of the mediterranean which the king had a mind to bestow upon prince alexander farnese but he returned him this answer that having reason to flatter himself that he had discharged this office well he could never be prevailed with to throw it up to another as long as he was capable of doing the duties of it himself  the kings confessor was upon the point of being sent away about the beginning of may the duke de medina celi designed that place for father bayona confessor of the university of alcala for he imagined he might reckon upon him and beside the king had given his consent they had a mind to bestow the bishopric of plazencia upon father francis de relux to have a favorable pretense to remove him but he used all the interest and credit he had in the world to keep his old post declaring that he would refuse the bishopric and that if the king turned him off he would everywhere complain of the chief minister although the duke de medina celi hated him heartily because he was difficult of access and having a great ascendant over the king possessed him with several scruples in order to pursue his own particular views yet he was forced to let him alone every one is of opinion that the duke had done much more discreetly not to have discovered his intentions against him unless he had been in a capacity to put them in execution because to show an ill will and not be able to effect our designs only draws more enemies upon our heads and exposes us to the contempt of all the world which will be apt to conclude we only are too weak but this was not all he left in the person of the confessor a man that was always with the king and who was sure to oppose him in every thing but that was not the only thing he had reason to apprehend the camarera mayor and don jeronimo de eguya still continued to possess the kings favors they had opportunity to discourse him as often as they pleased by virtue of their places and neglected no occasions to advance and secure their own interest this was a sort of a triumvirate which might very well check the authority of the chief minister he very well saw what he was to fear from this quarter and was extremely concerned at it he had long ago desired to remove de eguya but he fixed himself every day more and more in the kings good graces and the death of don pedro fernandez del campo left him in the entire possession of a place which before he had only exercised by a commission he likewise obtained a place of being a counselor in the chamber of the indies and when the duke used all his endeavors to remove him from business he perceived that the kings inclination prevailed above all his attempts to the contrary for his majesty was persuaded that de eguya was faithful and necessary to him the duchess de terra nvo as well as the confessor confirmed him in this opinion so that they rendered one another all good offices reciprocally and this was a sure and easy way to support themselves  ever since the night that the camarera mayor had received that chastisement from the queen after a long consideration of the matter she found that if she continued to observe the same rigorous conduct toward that young princess which she had hitherto used she could never insinuate her self into her affections besides this she knew that the queen mother utterly disapproved this sort of treatment and that she had frequently spoke to the king her son about it that she had represented to him that there was so vast a difference between the customs of france and those of spain that there was a necessity to make some allowances and not to perplex a young princess whose age as well as the sweetness of her temper deserved another sort of usage the camarera looked upon her self as undone if she did not lay aside all her former severity and these considerations prevailed with her to assume a more engaging air and to endeavor to relieve the queen in all her pensive moments by discovering the kings humor to her and the means to please him whenever the king was vexed and out of humor she seemed to spare no pains to sweeren him and the queen being of a frank easy disposition was immediately persuaded that the duchess had taken up a better temper and even believed that she did her all the services she could but the rest of the world were of a different opinion from her majesty they knew well enough that this old belldame was rather inclined in her own nature to throw oil into the fire than endeavor to quench it and they alleged as an indisputable proof of this all the ill impressions she had made upon the king in relation to the french nay even the most inconsiderable things that came from france for as i signified before the queen durst not play with the little dogs she had brought along with her before the king and the two parrots were killed for no other reason but because they talked french the king was out of humor as often as any frenchman passed through the court of the palace especially if the queen looked upon him although it was through the windows and lattices of her chamber  as she was going one day to our ladies church datocha a poor fellow who was a frenchman came to her coach and begged an alms of her the king was in so horrible a passion that they were afraid he would have caused this unfortunate wretch to be killed immediately the camerera officiously counseled the queen to order him to leave madrid without any delay but if the duchess had not prejudiced the king after this manner it is not to be imagined that the queen had been exposed to these injuries which happened so often to her  this is so undeniable a truth that one day when their majestys went into the city two gentlemen belonging to the ambassador of holland chancing to meet them they stopped their coach out of respect and saluted them as they ought they were on that side the queen happened to be of and were apparelled after the french fashion this immediately raised the camareras passion who commanded one of the guards to go and demand of them who they were from whence they came whither they were going what business they had in madrid and when to this they answered that they were both hollanders in the ambassadors retinue she believed it to be a sham or at least pretended to believe it that she might give the king a fresh occasion to commend her care and zeal for him so that she sent to the ambassador himself to be better satisfied and when she was fully assured of the truth she sent the two gentlemen word that when they met their majestys they should never be guilty of the presumption any more to go on the queens side to salute her or look upon her nevertheless observing the queen to be concerned at this conduct as soon as she was informed of it she thought to efface all this out of her mind by sending often to the french ambassador and giving him to understand that she was angry with him for coming so seldom to the palace she used the same expressions to the ambassadors lady and told her that it would be the greatest joy in the world to her to see them visit the young queen oftener who perhaps was too melancholy in private and would certainly find no small diversion to enjoy the company of persons of their merit and who were of the same country with her this did not make the marquess de villars alter his conduct in the least for he understood well enough what was the meaning of these fair speeches but as for his lady there seldom passed a day but she went to wait upon the queen either in the queenmothers company or all alone by her self but notwithstanding the assiduity of her visits she seldom found an opportunity to entertain her in private she was hindered from doing this by the presence of the spanish ladies who came to make their court or else by the kings coming who went every other moment from his own apartment to the queens for it is the custom there that as soon as he appears all the women that are in the chamber do immediately withdraw  without reckoning the penance of this extraordinary solitude the queen had other things to afflict her and one was to find her self clearly destitute of money and this considering the generosity of her heart and her natural inclination to be liberal was a very sensible mortification she had lived there six months entire without having any money to serve her for her lesser pleasures and she was forced to borrow a little to buy a few things she had necessary occasion for and to keep a few horses she had brought with her out of france that were become altogether unserviceable to her because she had no permission to ride them out at any time she wanted money likewise to send back some of her women that could not comply with the customs of spain and whom they could not consequently endure there the few officers that she was allowed to bring with her were all dismissed even to her chyrurgeon who had bought the place and performed the journey at his own expenses all of them departed and this consideration redoubled the young queens afflictions to see she was not mistress enough to keep them any longer or to do them those kindnesses she designed on the    th of may  00 pistols a month were assigned her but this was in a manner less than nothing because for six months together she had been forced to borrow money and even out of this small sum she was obliged to lay aside  00 pistols monthly for some alms and charity which the queens of spain were accustomed to make all this while no orders were given out about the current money of the kingdom nor was the price of victuals regulated a great want and scarcity reigned every where and the public miseries daily increased it had not rained for six months together and this very much contributed to inhance the price of corn so that the people were reduced to the last extremities nay what is infinitely more surprising they were not in a condition to pay the queen the money that was assigned to her gold and silver being so scarce that none of it was to be seen  the bishop of aquila being arrived at madrid took possession of his place of president of castile and the first of his cares was to relieve and ease the people of their grievances to effect this he made a strict examination into the most minute matters and soon discovered that the gross monopolies and insatiable avarice of the magistrates were partly the occasion of these horrid disorders he came to be informed that even the counselors of the council royal by some of their creatures took their shares of the imposts that were laid upon victuals and that the some thing was done in the oil chocolat  and other provisions necessary for life that the dors and corregidors belonging to the town hall played most abominable cheats in the corn and consequently advanced the price of bread at least one half above its usual price but he was sensible that he was not able to rectify these abuses alone so he discoursed the duke de medina celi about the matter whose encouragement and assistance he promised himself nevertheless whether the duke were otherwise employed or had no real intentions to change the form of the government he did not answer the presidents desires who perceiving that if he acted by himself the hatred of all those persons whom he should cause to be punished would directly fall upon his own head he was not willing to sacrifice himself for the public good he remembered that in the time of the regency a certain bishop who was president as he was having endeavored to suppress these abuses had been poisoned by the magistrates  in the mean time every thing without exception continued to be as dear as formerly and silver was so scarce a commodity that one would have imagined it had been all melted down i once saw at a relations house of mine the sum of almost three thousand crowns received in pieces of bellon and in ochavos these are much of the same value with the french doubles and are scarce an english farthing  which are a wretched sort of brass money and for the greatest part bad and yet happy was the man who in this universal scarcity could get this money however i am obliged to say this in honor of spain that although the finances were in that sad condition as i represented them before yet the king paid all the pensions that were due to foreigners very exactly because he looked upon himself obliged in honor to do it and yet to confess a truth some of these pensions were not inconsiderable i knew a certain lady to whom he gave eight thousand crowns and they were constantly paid her in the most difficult times  the families that were ready to die of hunger set themselves to rob and murder being in a manner authorized in these disorders by the little care that was taken to punish murderers as they deserved and by the extraordinary partiality which the judges show to the natives of the country these families i say that were very numerous at madrid assembled together in one of the least frequented quarters of the town and resolved by main force to break open some of the magistrates houses because they principally charged them with the disorders of the present affairs and afterward to plunder them in the face of the world to serve for an example to others but as this design was only formed by a mutinous rabble who had never a head to lead them on so it is not to be wondered if they did not push their wicked intentions any farther in short every man returned to his ordinary occupation and none of them were called to an account for assembling after this tumultuous manner behold now the effects which this sort of connivance and toleration always produces  the shoemakers being informed about the middle of may that the price of shoes was ordered to be regulated presented a petition to the new president of castile wherein with terms full of respect they represented their reasons against this regulation making it appear that they could not possibly lessen the price of shoes as long as leather was sold so dear as it was he sent them to the president of the chamber of the alcaldles so they formed themselves into a sort of a body to meet him with the greater ceremony but he being a man of a sour sullen humor fell into a passion to see so great a number of them he threatened to imprison them and told them that if their power were equal to their ill intentions they were to be feared because they were neither better nor worse than downright mutineers they muttered a few words and being at that time none of the strongest went in a body to find out their companions and friends and then immediately repaired to the court of the palace they ran under the windows of the kings chamber  it is the custom there when the people complain of the government they cried out as loud as they were able let the king live and let the ill government die as soon as the king perceived it he came near the window and was extremely surprised to see so great a rabble got together for by this time abundance of other people had joined them the king sent in great haste to find out the president of castile who came amongst them and promised them all the satisfaction imaginable he moreover told them they violated that respect they owed his majesty in coming to demand justice of him with such clamours and tumults and that if they would follow him home he would presently content them they very readily went along with him so he gave them a permission to sell their shoes at the same price as they did before the order was published this made them return the joyfullest people in the world but they happened to meet the president of the alcaldes in the way who not knowing a syllable of what had past and not at all considering that he had to do with an unruly mob stopped them to vent his reproaches and menaces against them but this procedure raised their indignation so high that they drew out their swords with a design to kill him and pursued him so fiercely that never was any man under more terrible apprehensions he had never escaped their hands had not their fury so far transported them that they took no notice how he saved himself through a little gate which he took care to shut after him but his fear was so great that he fell dangerously ill upon it after they had searched for him on all sides to no purpose they were going homewards when they saw the president of castile coming that way they presently surrounded him and swore they would not let him pass any farther till he had signed the permission he had givem them to sell their shoes at the ordinary price he immediately did every thing they demanded of him so without any delay they took drums and trumpets to publish and affix this permission to all the public places of the city they suffered this first heat to pass over without opposition but afterward they arrested several of those whom they found the most seditious nevertheless they tarried but a short time in prison and what deserved an exemplary chastisement was punished like an inconsiderable trifle it is indeed very true that in order to humble the people it was proposed to forbid all manner of tradesmen to carry swords about them and to wear black silk clothes with the golilia twas likewise designed that this prohibition should extend to all those persons who had no titles and were not able to keep a coach however they durst not put it in execution because they thought this regulation would be too difficult and severe to be practiced  the viceroy of naples was not a little afflicted at the loss of the money which the eight slaves had carried away with them he was obliged to get more but it was no easy matter to find it in a place where they were burdened every day with imposts upon imposts he received orders from madrid to let out the lands belonging to the kings demain at forty thousand crowns per annum but no body could be found to take them although those persons who had formerly taken them enjoyed them peaceably and this example one would have thought ought to have encouraged others to imitate them the banditti of that country had for some time suspended all acts of hostility out of hopes that his majesty would have given them a general indemnity upon the score of his marriage but when they perceived that their expectations were like to be frustrated and that endeavors were used to apprehend their captain mattheo tango who was just come from pirateering at sea they met to the number of three thousand pillaging and ravaging every thing they found in the country and what is strange not a word was spoken of the horrible disorders they committed  the queen mother who was every day at buen retiro and searched all means to gain the affections of the people gave three comedies with music between the acts that were represented on a theater in the placa mayor that abundance of people might have the pleasure of seeing them without putting them to any expense the comedians played for three days together and the crowd was so great that some people were killed the city seemed to be very well pleased with these shows for they love them more in spain than in any other part of the world and what helped to sustain the public joy was the mighty expectation they had of seeing a new face af affairs under the ministry of the duke ae medina celi they promised themselves to find an end of all their present grievances without considering that although his intentions were never so good it would be a difficult matter to redress them he had don vincente gonzaga for his friend who was very capable to advise him and furnish him with all necessary expedients to accomplish his designs but the execution of them seemed to carry almost invincible difficulties along with it there was a necessity to be severe to disgust some and punish others to remove several things that had been long established to give ones self up entirely to business and constant application before these matters could ever be accomplished but this was not the genius of the duke and his natural sweetness and bounty suited but very ill with that steadiness and resolution that ought to be observed in these nice rancounters this gave him abundance of uneasy thoughts so that don vincente who still pressed him to take up steady measures and support them with vigor had opportunity enough to discover his weakness to deliver himself therefore from so rigid and severe a supervisor the duke gave him the government as it is called there of the council of the indies upon condition that he himself should always be the president of it but as for the profits one had as great a share as the other and now don vincente thought of nothing more than discharging the duties of his new place and it was not doubted but he would worthily exercise them for his judgment his age and his experience made him to be considered as one of the chief persons of the council  in the mean time several people of great merit and birth were displeased to she the duke confided in him no longer they were in hopes that they would have joined together to regulate the money the good was diminished as i said before and the bad continued to go as freely as formerly it did it was therefore resolved to suppress it for good and all in commerce and an edict was published on the    th of may    0 by which the king suppressed all the copper money that had gone for several years and people were ordered to bring it in within ten days to certain offices that were set up in all parts of madrid where they were to receive bills of exchange for it that were payable in six months but they found a vast inconvenience in the execution of this project for in the two castiles they had sixteen millions of this money part of which were mixed with good silver and the other was notoriously bad so that to draw these sixteen millions out of the hands of private persons they found in the kings coffers a fund of only sixscore thousand crowns however this did not hinder the crying down of the money and as for those persons that had store of it they were utterly undone it is an easy matter to imagine what sad effects these new grievances drew upon the people who were miserable enough in all conscience before and who were forced to buy every thing at excessive rates  the ministers of the inquisition with their trumpets kettledrums and banners marching before them went on the  0 th of may in a cavalcade from the palace to the placa major where they ordered it to be published that on the  0 th of june they would publicly punish all those whom they had condemned to the fire and other torments it was forty years ago since a thing of this nature had been seen and and the sight was expected at madrid with as great an impatience as if it had been the most agreeable festival in the world  don thomas de la cerda brother to the duke de medinaceli parted for cales with so magnificent an equipage that a prince of the blood could not have a finer three men of war waited to carry him over to new spain of which he was made viceroy  they received advices at court that the count de fuensalida viceroy of navar had sent some troops to fontarabia under the command of the duke de canzano this conduct did not seem to agree with the orders they had sent him from this place to give satisfaction to the french fishermen of andaye who had been abused and injured  on the    th of june a bullfeast was kept at which the king and the queen attended by all the court made their appearance this seemed an extraordinary fine show to the spaniards because two of the combatants were killed upon the spot and three cavaliers more were dangerously wounded the queen was so concerned at it that she found her self somewhat discomposed however she took care not to discover it for fear of disquieting the king  the count de gubernatis envoy extraordinory of savoy waited for his orders to depart but he received a command to attend the marquess de dronero who went ambassador extraordinary into portugal so he tarried at court without any character  we were here informed that the spanish captains who were at naples were not a little mortified at the prohibition that was issued out to forbid them to go dressed after the french fashion there is never a spaniard of em all that is not ravished with joy as soon as he is out of his own country to quit the habit of it also and to oblige them to wear it again nothing less will serve the turn but reiterated edicts one upon the back of another  the execrable secret of preparing the most subtle poison that is so frequently practiced in italy has been used from time to time in the kingdom of naples the regent galeota who came back from gaeta made a sad experiment of it in a dose of physic which dispatched him in a few hours after the viceroy of naples who loved him dearly expressed a mighty sorrow at his loss and promised that if ever he was able to discover the crime he would make a notorious example of those that were concerned in it  on the  0 th of june there was kept at madrid an auto de inquisition that is to say a general execution of the jews the people ran thither in their best clothes and with as great an earnestness as if it had been to the most solemn show a great scaffold was erected in the placa mayor where from seven a clock in the morning till nine at night nothing was to be seen but criminals of both sexes that had been sent from all the inquisitions to madrid their process was read aloud and judgment was pronounced against them twenty jews as well men was women and a renegado mohammedan were sentenced to be burnt five more jews of both sexes this being the first time they were apprehended and now repenting of their errors were condemned to a long imprisonment and to wear a yellow scapulary with a red st andrews cross upon it which they call a sanbenito as those that carry this habit are called sanbenitados ten more accused of bigamy witchcraft and sorcery were sentenced to be whipped and sent to the galleys these wore pastboard bonnets upon their heads with inscriptions upon them having a rope about their necks and torches in their hands all the court was present the king the two queens the ladies the ambassadors the grandees and a great multitude of people the inquisitors chair was placed after the manner of a tribunal and was much above that of the king and a great deal higher these unfortunate people were persecuted so near the king that he heard all their complaints and groans for the scaffold where they were ranged touched his balcony the grandees of spain did the same thing here as our provostmarshals men do in france they conducted the criminals that were to be burnt and held them tied fast with thick cords the famillares that is to say the domestic officers of the holy inquisition at the same time led the other offenders and several of the religious whether learned or ignorant disputed vehemently with them to convince these miserable creatures of the truth of our religion some of the jews were very knowing in their own way of worship and returned very surprising answers to their disputants amongst the rest there was a young woman of admirable beauty who seemed not to be above seventeen years of age and happening to be on the same side where the queen was she addressed her self to her to obtain favor at her hands great queen says she cannot your royal presence bring some remedy to my misfortunes have pity on my youth and consider that i am persecuted for a religion which i have sucked in with my mothers milk the queen turned away her eyes and appeared to pity her case but durst not make any intercession to have her saved  mass was now began in the midst of which the priest that officiated quitted the altar and sat down upon a seat which was prepared for him then the inquisitorgeneral descended from the amphitheater dressed in his cope and having a mitre on his head and after he had bowed toward the altar he advanced to the kings balcony which he ascended by some steps that went round the scaffold accompanied by some officers of the inquisition who carried the cross and the evangelists and a book containing the oath by which the kings of spain oblige themselves to protect the catholic faith to extirpate heresies and to support the procedures of the inquisition with their royal authority  the king stood up with his head uncovered and having the constable of castile on one side of him who held the royal sword lifted up swore to observe the oath which a counselor of the council royal read to him and continued in this posture till such time as the inquisitor was returned to his place then a secretary of the inquisition got up in a pulpit and read the same oath which he caused the councils and all the assembly to take it was about noon when mass began and it was not over till nine a clock at night by reason of the long sentences of the condemned persons that were read aloud one after another the constancy and resolution with which they went to the place of punishment had something in it which was very extraordinary several of them cast themselves into the fire others burnt their hands and afterward their feet in the flames bearing their torments with a tranquillity which made them be lamented that such resolute souls were not illuminated with the light of faith as for myself i did not go to behold this sad spectacle for besides that it was midnight and the place of execution was without the gate of  i was so concerned at what i had seen in the daytime that i found my self indisposed the king could not avoid seeing this horrible sight both because it was a religious affair and because he is obliged to authorize by his presence whatever the inquisition does we must not believe that these rigorous examples do in the least promote the conversion of the jews they are not at all concerned at it and there are a considerable number of them in madrid who are known to be such and yet are quietly suffered to enjoy their employments in the finances amongst these don aventura dionis was reckoned his father gave seventy thousand crowns to be made a knight of st jago and he himself a few days after this execution obtained of the king a marquesss title which stood him in fifty thousand crowns his uncle was one of the most famous jews of amsterdam all this was known at court but there was not the least notice taken of it and indeed the general receipts and farms are full of these people when they are rich the spaniards content themselves with affrighting them that they may make them empty their purses to redeem their lives by this means they draw prodigious sums of money from them and provided they are in a condition to pay a good round sum they make a shift to escape the fire which they deserve as well as the rest  the duke de giovenazzo who from being envoy at the court of savoy was nominated to go ambassador to that of france was ordered to return to turin but the count de gubernatis who at that time was under no character at madrid and who was making preparations for his journey to portugal went to find out the chief minister and represented to him that the duke his master was so ill satisfied to see that his ministers were not treated in spain with the same respect as they were in france and especially because they did not pay him these great sums that were due to him that he desired to see an envoy of spain no more at turin the duke de medinaceli answered him that whatever treatment was paid his master in france ought not to be used as a consequence for the king of spain to do the like who was so far above all other kings that he had no example to follow the count replied that he had no mind at present to enter into an examination of their greatness or the difference that might be between them but that he had not forgotten that about twenty years ago philip iv had declared by the marquess de la fuente that his ambassador should not appear at the ceremonies where those of france assisted and that this declaration was very well known and accordingly regulated in all the courts of europe the duke answered him that he knew nothing of the matter and that he could hardly believe the business was as he represented it in the mean time they made several reflections at court upon the proposals of the duke of savoy and don antonio de la cerda who had been nominated to go to turin was recalled home before he arrived there nevertheless they dispensed with themselves so far as to send to compliment the duke upon the alliance he was going to make with the infanta of portugal  this princess as it was commonly pretended was supposed to be poisoned and what made the world judge so was because one of her officers having carried some of the dishes from her table to his own house his wife and some others after they had eat of them found themselves extremely ill that they believed they should die and had all of them marks of poison about them this accident occasioned a great bustle at lisbon the people mutinied and wanting an object for their fury to work upon they designed to pick a quarrel with the spanish envoy although they had no reason for it and he was just upon the point of suffering the greatest outrages imaginable the portugueses had afterward a new occasion to grieve them caused by the death of don duarte ribero who was sent ambassador to savoy he happened to die in the territories of spain after so violent and sudden a manner that all the world was astonished at it and this served to increase the suspicions they formerly entertained of the evil intentions of some persons in relation to the infanta  a little time appeased all these clamours and the count de gubernatis departed toward the end of june to go for portugal  on the   d of the same month the marquess de grana ambassador from the emperor made his entry all his retinue were barely clothed in gray and his coaches had no gilding about them most people were surprised at the sight and to say the truth this was not the right way to please in madrid for there they show them more or less respect according to the expenses they are at in these sorts of occasions to this we may add that the people there love fine shows above any thing in the world and it being known that the ambassador had received twenty five thousand crowns to defray the charges of his journey and that he drew every year from the emperor and the king forty thousand crowns more they were ready to throw stones at him when they saw him make so scandalous an entry don diego de bracamonte ambassador of malta was the reason why he made his entry no sooner he was still of opinion that they had not done him justice when the marquess de villars made his entry but that as soon as ever he renewed his pretensions he should have satisfaction given him being under these expectations he demanded that his chariot might march immediately after that of the last ambassador of the chapel the marquess de grana would by no means consent to it alleging what had been formerly done by the ambassador of france and so that example was followed this small difference was scarce determined when the marquess de grana had another contest with don geronimo deguya he would have had him make the first visit as the other secretaries of state had always done before him deguya excused himself by pretending that all the other ambassadors has come first to visit him and that he lay under no obligations to make any particular distinctions for the sake of monsieur de grana upon this the other ambassadors taking notice what ill advantage he had made of the civility they showed him unanimously declared that they never pretended to make that visit as if it had been a duty incumbent upon them so that deguya was not a little mortified at a declaration so contrary to his vanity and pretensions and found himself now under an indispensable necessity to go first to the ambassador of germany  he tarried till the court was gone to the escurial and took his opportunity to go to his house on a certain day when he knew he was not at home but this did not satisfy the marquess who said he reckoned that visit for nothing which he had not received deguya answered that he had acquitted himself of his duty and thus they did not see one another at all the ambassador extraordinary of malta made his entry which though it made no magnificent appearance was handsomely ordered  it was no small satisfaction to them at court to hear that the flora for the indies which they believed would scarce be in a condition to go this year by reason that the great disorder of the current money had not a little hindered all manner of commerce had set sail out of the port of cales and made a happy voyage with the brother of the duke de medinaceli who went viceroy to new spain but to allay their joy they were informed that one of the greater vessels had struck against a rock in the middle of the bay and received so much damage that springing a leak on every side they had not time enough to bring her off to any place where they might unload and repair her so that she was lost with some of her passengers and all her merchandise  the duke of medinaceli not being absolutely assured to continue chief minister long thought it the best way to make all advantages of the present opportunity he had nine daughters but had only married two of them and had a great mind to bestow the third upon the son of the constable colonna who was newly returned to madrid from his viceroyship of arragon and had brought his children along with him this appeared to be a very advantageous match for the dukes daughter and therefore having it still in his eye he showed a particular respect to the marquess de los balbazez who was brotherinlaw to the constable few persons penetrated at first into the true motive of the thing they thought he did it only to have a fit occasion to take his instructions because he was capable of giving him the best but the more understanding people soon discovered that the great desire he had to conclude this alliance was the principal reason for at the bottom the marquess de los balbazez had more reputation at the time when his embassies and great negotiations kept him at a distance than when he was at madrid whether it proceeded from the envy the world bore him or that his presence made them examine his faults more narrowly it is certain that people had a better opinion  him when he was absent than when they saw him before them the good graces of the duke still contributed to draw more hatred and envy upon him but they did not last long enough to made him suffer any thing upon that account  one of the greatest things they usually reproached balbazez with was his excessive avarice which busied it self in the most inconsiderable matters although he was master of a plentiful fortune and might have lived after another manner without incommoding his estate in the least he was a genoese of the house of spinola his grandfather had formerly commanded the spanish army and this was likewise a great captain but whether it were because he was a stranger or for some other reason the grandees of spain looked upon him as much inferior to them although he was a grandee as well as themselves and was of illustrious birth they despised him because he made advantage of his money after the manner of a banker which is so seldom practiced in spain by persons of quality that they cannot endure those that do it his enemies pretended that he had committed notorious oversights at the treaty of nimeguen and that they daily beheld new inconveniences arise from his ill conduct there that this was the subject of perpetual quarrels between france and spain because he had neglected to lay down in plain intelligible terms what things were yielded up and their dependencies and that every one made use of this obscurity to interpret it to their own advantage  it is certain that what they alleged against the marquess de los balbazez had foundation enough but the constable of castile was the man that took the greatest pains to expose his miscarriages to the world he had no kindness for him for don juans sake whose favorite he had always been and for which reason the marquess declared against the queen this was the true cause of the aversion that was between the constable and him and it increased very much on the side of the former when he saw what a respect and esteem the duke de medina celi testified for the other he needed no more than this to revive the old grudge he had against the chief minister and it proceeded so far that he incessantly heightened the complaints that came from all parts under the dominion of the king of spain against the duke it must be allowed that the constable was one of the most dexterous prudent men of his age and that his rank and great abilities gave him vast advantages over the rest so that whenever he gave his advice few people were found so hardy as to oppose him the duke was sensible that he directly thwarted him upon all occasions this together with his other affairs made him extremely uneasy to find himself perpetually engaged in a troublesome combat and to dispute against a man who as we may say took a pleasure in chafing himself and who searched all occasions to perplex and disgust him therefore in this affair the duke took the mildest course he courted the constables friendship and made all advances toward it he knew that he was fallen ill and that though he was not in a condition to go to the council he was not so much indisposed but that he might have his advice in case it were demanded  he sent constantly to the constables house to consult him upon all important occasions and this mark of distinction flattered his vanity so agreeably that he found himself mightily obliged to the duke he wanted very little of pretending to be always sick for the time to come as long as the duke continued to give him so evident a proof of deference however it is very certain that although he was as well as ever he would not stir abroad for a long time only to prolong a thing which filled him with so much pleasure and satisfaction he received another obligation from the duke which made no less an impression upon him a considerable benefice happening to be vacant he bested it immediately upon one of his natural s without the constables ever demanding it so many unexpected favors perfectly overcame him and made him desirous to do something on his side so he proposed to submit to a reference in order to accommodate the business of the duke de cardonnes succession the constable had espoused his widow and the duke his daughter these two ladies had great pretensions and as great differences therefore they thought it the best way to determine them by the mutual consent of both parties the duke was sensible that the constable who naturally loved long tedious lawsuits showed a great deal of complaisance in this matter and indeed the constable was of opinion that it would be better to put an end to this affair than be engaged in an everlasting contest with the chief minister  this chief minister often assisted the king and denied audience to no body but neither did his endeavors or audiences produce any advantageous effects for the public interest and the smallest affairs were as difficult for him to determine as the greatest the marquess de grana knew so well beforehand what he was to expect upon this score that he could not be brought to accept the embassy for spain till he received express orders from the emperor although for his farther encouragement he had several relations and friends at madrid and that besides his having resided there formerly the consideration of those favors he might reasonably expect for his masters sake ought to have overcome the unwillingness he expressed to come to this court it is true what served to increase it very much was the secret advantage which he  his enemies and those that envied him might have upon him during his absence from vienna but for all this he found he had reason enough to be content with the manner of his usage the king allowed him a double franchise and paid all the charges of his house at his arrival the two queens honored the marchioness de grana and her daughters with several presents they favored him in every thing yet nevertheless he could not forbear to say proudly that he hoped he should not tarry there above a year and that it should not be his fault if he did not depart sooner he was a fine gentleman had abundance of wit penetration and conduct but he was of a prodigious bigness and found himself mightily incommoded by it he sometimes could not help changing his countenance when he happened to be in company with people whom he was not well acquainted with when they looked steadfastly upon him the court of spain had such favorable inclinations for him that they readily granted him whatever he desired but they could not forbear now and then to promise him some things which they never performed and he himself was sensible that they never would he was frequently vexed upon these occasions saying that it was his misfortune not to know what he might depend upon he was concerned at the misery to which all sorts of people were reduced at madrid and i have heard him frequently say that whatever ideas a man might form to himself of the public grievances yet they infinitely fell short of what they really were when he came to see them and that for his part he could not imagine what remedies they could apply to them it is indeed true that funds were wanting for the most necessary exigencies and that they were forced to borrow five thousand pistols for the subsistence of some troops that they thought convenient to send to italy and the frontiers of biscay by reason of the apprehensions they had at court of the designs of our king i have heard it often said that the couriers could not go for want of money to defray the expenses of their journey although they had affairs of great consequence to dispatch and the marquess de los balbazez who knew this better than any body represented to the duke de medina celi that there was a perfect necessity to take full cognizance of the funds upon which they might depend for the time to come the duke relishing this proposal ordered a true scheme of the kings revenues to be brought before him but the president of the finances and some others after they had deliberated as their fashion was upon the matter that is with a regard only to their own proper interests answered all with one consent that what he demanded of them was the work of several years this answer was sufficient to make him abandon the undertaking for the duke never cared to engage himself in any business that was of long continuance nay he had scarce resolution enough to go through those things which he was obliged suddenly to begin and as soon to finish one of the best examples i can produce to justify this is his leaving the camarera major don geronimo de eguya and the confessor quietly to enjoy their places without endeavoring to remove them whether it were because he despised them or that he imagined them to be too powerful to attempt any thing against them the weakness which he showed in that rancounter served only to increase their courage and haughtiness and they went so far at last as not to fear him at all they possessed the king with a strong aversion to him and insinuated several things into him that were quite opposite to the dukes intentions he was well enough sensible of it but his natural insensibility hindered him from resenting it his gentleness rendred him contemptible both to one and the other but particularly to the duchess de terra nova who spoke often to the king about him and explained her self upon her constant chapter the duke in such bitter language that he being informed of it as he certainly was every body had reason to wonder how he was able to endure it  this illnatured old beldame had only a seeming and not a real kindness for the young queen and it lasted so short a time that her usage served only to make the queen sensible that she knew how to moderate her self well enough when she saw it was necessary for her interest so to do but as this was indeed a true constraint upon her nature and she could not counterfeit the least sweetness of temper without a great reluctance so she soon reassumed her proper character and her persecutions became more frequent than ever the queen utterly impatient of this rigorous deportment charmed the king one day by all manner of tender engaging caresses till she found him in a humor to deny her nothing after some time had past she told him that if she was dear to him she conjured him to give her some testimony of it that was as well necessary for her health as the satisfaction of her mind he promised to consent to whatever she desired why then says she deliver me from the tyranny of the duchess de terra nova this demand surprised him and it was a pretty while before he returned her any answer but knowing that this had disquieted her a long time he told her at last that what she requested had never any president and that no queen had ever changed her camarera major ah sir replied the queen your majesty has shown me several faours for which none of your predecessors have left any example and cannot you then condescend to grant me this i consent to it says the king taking her by the hand i consent to it but then madam have a care upon whom you cost your eyes for after this fast choice it will be impossible for you to make another the queen testified her joy and acknowledgment by thanks proportionable to the pleasure she received  the first journey she made was to acquaint the queen mother with the news not at all questioning but that she would almost show as much joy upon this occasion as her self  but she was not a little surprised to find her so reserved and cold as if the matter were absolutely indifferent to her this mightily perplexed her and so she discovered the whole affair to the french ambassadors lady who took pains to put her in heart again by making her sensible that the queen mother was only apprehensive of seeing this place filled by some other lady who might perhaps be full as disagreeable to her as the duchess de terra nova was and that she was of opinion that if she proposed some body to her whom she liked she would open her self more clearly to her the young queen replied that she would do nothing in this business without the advice of the queen her motherinlaw that she was minded to have said as much to her when she first discoursed her about it but that she seemed to be so indifferent in the matter that she had not confidence enough to explain her self farther the queen judged it would be expedient to acquaint the duke de medina celi with this affair for fear lest if she made a mystery of it and he should afterward happen to discover it he might look upon himself to be disobliged and resent it so much as to endeavor to hinder the accomplishment of it but she still lay under some perplexities because she fancied she did not understand the spanish language well enough to be able to hold any long conversation in it with the duke and this was a nice case wherein she ought to explain her self clearly and intelligibly she was yet more afraid that the camarera who was always a listening in all parts of her apartment and who sometimes slipped into corners where without being perceived she understood and saw every thing that past would go and discover what she said concerning her these reasons prevailed with her to charge one of her women in whom she reposed a great confidence to go to don antonio de la cerda who was a near relation of the duke de medina celi and who besides expressed a great zeal for her majesty and desire him to acquaint the chief minister with what had happened and to tell him that since the the queen was resolved to remove her camerera she desired him to choose for her one of his friends of whose fidelity he was assured and that it was necessary for him to assist her in this affair to the end that acting in consort one with another the business might succeed to their common satisfaction the duke received the honor the queen did him with a great deal of respect and acknowledgement and sent his duchess that very evening to return her his most humble thanks when she came to the queens apartment she tarried till the other ladies were gone out of the room that she might have a better opportunity of making her compliment  the queen who knew very well that the duchess was sensible enough of the favorable condescentions she had made on her side was desirous to bestow the place upon her but the affair did not succeed as she imagined because that lady had too much business upon her hands to accept the offer i have designed it for you says the queen and i am of opinion that you will not be unwilling to serve me the duchess thanked her as in duty obliged and told her she could wish with all her heart that she was in a condition to accept this honor and that no body in the world should serve her majesty more faithfully than she would but her health was so ill that it would not permit her to render her those services in which that place as well as her own inclinations would engage her but the queen continuing to press her still she told her that although this consideration was laid aside yet she had another of equal importance which she could never dispense with that she had seven daughters upon whose education and good conduct all her cares were bestowed and therefore she requested her majesty to think of her no more however she durst assure her she believed the marchioness de los velez to be the most proper person to execute this place that she was a lady of great merit and illustrious birth that she had formerly been governante to the young king and consequently being so well known to his majesty could more dexterously humor and please him than any one besides the queen very well approved of this advice and the duchess afterward withdrew she gave her husband an account of what conversation had passed between her and the queen but he was displeased to hear that she had recommended the marchioness de los velez because he had already engaged himself in behalf of the duchess de albuquerque and earnestly desired to see her advanced to this post  the confidence which the king reposed in de eguya would not permit him to conceal from him the promise he made the queen to remove the camerera he for his part omitted nothing that might turn off the intended blow but he found the king was so fully resolved to satisfy the queen that he perceived it would be to no purpose to use any importunities with him upon this score so all he could do in the matter was only to acquaint the camarera with what was designed against her that so she might be the better provided to bear the shock when it happened she had some suspicions of this before it being her principal talent to penetrate into the most secret affairs this blow sensibly afflicted her and she could not forbear to speak to the queen about it madam says she i should reckon my self extremely unfortunate if my zeal for your majesty should ever happen to displease you i have spoken to you with more zeal and perhaps with more freedom than any one has done nevertheless my design was only to inspire you with a desire of learning all our fashions that so you might absolutely possess the heart and good inclinations of the king the liberty i took has appeared too assuming i have drawn your displeasure upon my self by endeavoring to deserve your affection and i am informed at last that your majesty desires to see my place filled by another the queen surprised to see that the affair she had communicated to so few persons had taken air answered coldly it is not worth the while madam to trouble your self about what people say few persons know my thoughts and it is a thing usually practiced in courts to invent news and then to relate it as if it were true the camarera was not able to draw any discoveries from this conversation but whether her conscience reproached her for the conduct she had used or else she had been informed of the queens designs before de eguya spoke to her about them it was some time ago since she suspected that she was to be removed and upon that consideration having examined all the ladies of the court who gave her the greatest jealousy she found three viz the marchioness de los velez the duchess de albuquerque and the duchess de linfantado this is the cause that she took her measures a long time before and spoke of these three ladies in very disobliging terms before the queen whenever an occasion presented it self she accused the marchioness de los velez for her haughtiness in all her actions and for her insupportable severity she pretended that the duchess de albuquerque hated all the french so mortally that when she happened to meet any of that nation she turned her eyes aside that she might not behold them and that she valued her self so mightily upon the score of her high birth and virtue that she had always something or other to say against all the world and then as for the duchess de linfantado she represented her as an old doting woman who at the best had never any great share of wit and had now totally lost it by reason of her great age she was not content to speak of them after this manner but engaged all the french women who were near the queen to insinuate the same opinion into her and they acquitted themselves in the matter as well as they could out of hopes that if the duchess continued in her post still she would take care to consider them for their good services  what they said to the queen upon this occasion made but a small impression upon her mind and the first time she could find an opportunity to discourse the queen mother about it she acquainted her with her designs in favor of the marchioness de los velez but she expressed as great an indifference at this motion as she did at first this gave the queen no small affliction so she imagined that she ought to inform her of every thing that was laid to the duchess de terra novas charge as well upon the affair of don carlos of arragon whom she caused to be assassinated as several other things that rendered her odious after this she added the particulars of the deportment she had used toward her but the queen mother pretended as if all this were news to her and still continued to speak very kindly of the camarera not that she had the least kindness for her in reality for she had not forgotten how deeply she had been engaged in the interests of don juan and she had not as yet forgiven the memory of that prince for the troubles he brought upon her  the reason of her using this conduct with the queen was only to exclude the marchioness de los velez and the duchess de linfantado whom she did not greatly care for she thought with her self that if she desired to oblige the queen to take a camarera from her hands it would be necessary for her to testify no aversion for her that was to fill that place and that the queen being desirous to be seconded by her would demand of her whom she pitched upon and so take a person of her own choosing the young queen was aware of her motherin laws designs however she pretended to know nothing of them supposing that such a one would be always obliged to do as the queen mother directed her having therefore a particular inclination for the marchioness de los velez she was resolved to sound the kings sentiments upon that affair and proposed her to him but he expressed an extraordinary antipathy to her if says he you knew the marchioness de los velez as well as i do i am confident you would never think of placing her so near you she has been my governante and is the only person in the world whom i dread most the duke de medina celi desired no more to see her in that station than the king did and showed as great a dislike to the duchess de linfantado all their votes concurred in behalf of the duchess de albuquerque and it was agreed upon at last to persuade the queen that she ought to choose her  this choice had infallibly succeeded if the queen could have cured her self of those disagreeable impressions which the camarera had made upon her in relation to that duchess she often thought of the imperious humor that was attributed to her of the pretended aversion she had to the french but especially of what the king had told her that when once the duchess de terra nova was removed and another put into her place she must never think of turning her off she was persuaded that she should be no gainer by the change if she pitched upon the duchess de albuquerque nay that it might so happen to her as to be a considerable loser by it this imagination hindered her from pushing this affair any farther and she thought  would be much better to tarry a little till she could find out some other lady who might  altogether agreeable to her in effect as she wa searching after one she was told of the marchioness de eytona who was a woman of solid virtue great merit and had abundance of wit and gallantry in fine she was every way so well accomplished that it was necessary for her majesty to have her near her and by the relations she had at the queenmothers court and with the chief minister she could not choose but please both parties alike the king showed no opposition to her and the queen who knew her loved her already so that she was mighty joyful to meet with one whom she liked so well but this joy did not continue long for the marchioness de eytona fell sick and died a few days after the young queen was sensibly afflicted at this loss and not knowing where to make a better choice she came back again to the marchioness de los velez because she comprehended no difference between the duchess de terra nova and the duchess de albuquerque and as for the duchess de linfantado she perceived well enough that she was not fit for her  but now to propose the marchioness de los velez was to attempt a thing that could never succeed for the reasons i have already mentioned the marchioness who perceived them better than any body could not endure to be so long exposed to an exclusion that was so very disobliging to her so she went to find out the queen and returned her thanks for her great favors but she told her that her age and the trouble she had had with the king when she was governante to him gave her so great a disrelish for the court that she could by means reconcile her self to it and therefore desired her to think of her no more all these difficulties seemed to arise for the satisfaction of the duchess de terra nova or at least they proved the occasion why she continued still in her place and that the queen utterly wearied to find so many disappointments in her way was come to such a pass that she was no longer desirous to remove her the queen mother all the while intrigued more than she because she earnestly desired to have that lady turned out of the palace  what still contributed to make the young queen less concerned for the matter was that her mind was taken up with new troubles that were more pressing upon her than those she received from the camarera i mean the apprehensions they had at court of a rupture between the two crowns the queen remained inconsolable when she considered that the peace of nimeguen of which she was as it were the seal was going to be broken the love she had for france and the obligations that fastened her to spain balanced all her inclinations and she often shed tears out of a fear only of seeing the war renewed  the most christian king pretended that the spaniards had pillaged and abused his subjects in several places and either burnt or taken many french vessels that they returned him no answer at madrid to the complaints he had made that the marquess de borgomaine who resided at london in quality of ambassador extraordinary from the king of spain observed no manner of measures nay not even those that decency prescribes that he had made a league in the name of the king his master with the king of england against france that he was well informed that as he was upon his departure to go ambassador to vienna he had received private orders to stay some time in holland to try if he could persuade the hollanders to do the most prejudicial things they could do to france the king provoked at so clandestine a conduct and so extraordinary in the midst of a peace which he had not infringed the least on his part was resolved to act according to his usual justice and equity and finding himself possessed with these resentments he had nothing to incline him to believe that he was obliged to part with any of his rights  he ordered his galleys to put to sea with an express command to make those of spain give them the first gun whenever they met them he knew that this affair had been regulated at the same time when philip iv had agreed that his ambassadors should never appear in public with those of france and he made the duke de medina celi be acquainted that the conduct he used during the peace was so opposite to peace it self that he saw himself obliged to seek out all advantages on his side as he found it expedient  the king of spain for his part complained of the exact severity that was shown him in the smallest matters alleging that when the commissioners of the most christian king were to have adjusted with those that came from spain the limits of what had been yielded up by the treaty of nimeguen the french had refused to treat with the deputies of spain as long as the catholic king should take upon him the quality of the duke of burgundy they added a declaration to this refusal that if within a certain time assigned they did not treat by virtue of another commission where this title was not inserted they would immediately put the king of france in possession of the territories and rights which belonged to him so that the king of spain was content to cut off the titles he usually assumes with an etc  this league about which the marquess de borgomaine made such a bustle and stir in england was at last concluded with spain it was a mutual engagement on both sides whereby they obliged themselves to defend one another in what place soever they should happen to be attacked for this end england was to furnish eight thousand foot and thirty men of war and spain was obliged to send an hundred thousand crowns every month into flanders to keep the garrisons there in a good condition and have twelve thousand men in pay in champagne they were in good hopes that the emperor and the hollander would likewise enter into the league don pedro ronquillo ambassador extraordinary of spain in england sent a courier with a ratification of the treaty which was received at madrid on the    th of june    0  most people were very well satisfied when they saw the several motions on both sides that the war would infallibly be kindled somewhere or other in flanders the duke de villa hermosa had demanded to be recalled home and that another governor might be sent to supply his place the unconcerned temper as well as the natural slowness of the spaniards held the matter a considerable time in suspense without giving themselves the trouble to determine it the marquess de los balbazes was first pitched upon to be sent thither but as soon as he received advice of it he endeavored all he could to get himself excused out of an apprehension that they would engage him at the same time to contract vast debts to which his thrifty humor gave him an invincible aversion besides this they found it a difficult matter to meet with any subject who was to their mind the report ran that the duke of lorrain would go to command there in chief afterward it was said the duke of newburg would be the man for whom the marquess de grana did several good offices after they had deliberated a long time about the merits of these two competitors at last they cast their eyes upon prince alexander farnese he obtained the preference and was named about the beginning of july he was brother to the duke of parma and was about threescore year old the gout very much troubled him and the talness of his stature was very extraordinary he had been a long time devoted to spain and particularly to the queen mother at the juncture when she had those great differences with don juan he had been general of the cavalry in estramadura and catalonia and passed for a very great soldier although it is certain he had but very little experience and the management of his private affairs sufficiently demonstrated it for he owed every body money paid seldom and had not a farthing by him his profuseness and his mistresses ruined him and although after all he had really a great estate yet it was miserably encumbered it was the general opinion here that if the war commenced flanders would be the first victim and this made them believe that it would be less ignominious for spain to suffer this loss when an italian was governor of the low countries than if a spaniard were there in short it could be nothing else but this consideration only that could possibly induce them to believe they did well to fill this post with a man who never had managed as yet any affair of that vast importance as these were they bargained with don francisco de castile for the sum of three hundred thousand crowns which was to be remitted to brussels for the payment of the troops and after prince alexander had received the thirty thousand crowns which the king ordered to be given him to bear the expense of his voyage he parted on the    th of july to go and take shipping at the groyne in galicia he took along with him abundance of volunteers and a numerous train of domestics he sent a courier into france to get necessary pasports and left the court in such haste that he forgot to carry with him the patent for his government it was not very long before he heartily repented for so doing and he pressed earnestly to have it however they promised him one but deferred to expedite it so that he could only be said to be governor for the interim and it was believed with reason enough that he would not be well pleased with this usage he had entrusted some persons at madrid to solicit this affair for him but they refused the expeditions when the court would oblige them to take them in such a form and after many petitions on their side and several contests with the ministers about it it was not at last inserted into the patent after what manner he was made governor  in the mean time the prince departed from madrid with so little money according to his usual custom that he was scarce arrived at the groyne but he dispatched a courier away to the court with some letters wherein he demanded money to perform his voyage they answered him very coldly that they would advise him not to defer the day of his departure and that they could by no means believe that he had already spent his thirty thousand crowns he embarked immediately accompanied by some vessels belonging to biscay which transported five hundred new raised men that had been levied in galicia and were commanded to guard the frontiers the people in flanders had not for many years seen any other governor but don juan he possessed the government as his own till his death and although he was at so great a distance yet couriers were still dispatched to him to receive his orders even in the most important conjunctures to say the truth the constable of castile had been sent thither as i have already observed in the beginning of these memoirs in the place of that prince and he obtained a general patent without specifying in it that it was only by a commission but the queen mother would have it so on purpose to disgust don juan  the pressing necessity there was for money in flanders obliged the duke de medina celi to search with all imaginable application some means or other to furnish them with some and he tried several without meeting any success don francisco de castile immediately promised to remit thirty thousand crowns thither and afterward engaged to make a return of eighteen hundred thousand florins more upon which consideration they were to give him two hundred thousand crowns in hand and to pay him the rest at different times upon assignations which in all probability would never have been paid to him he questioning it very much was not willing to be their fool and resolved to send no money to brussels but accordingly as he received it at madrid they failed to perform the promise they had made him to pay him two hundred thousand crowns down upon the nail and he for his part failed them in the rest  now how was it possible to draw such a sum as this out of the kings treasury when it was totally exhausted the inferior officers of his house having tarried for their wages longer than they could well do except they reduced themselves to downright beggary would have thrown up their liveries being resolved to quit the service unless they had been partly detained by menaces and partly by fair promises to see them paid if they continued in it still as for people of quality they could not tell what to do after they had pawned their jewels their plate nay even their canopies of state and their wearing apparel they found they had now no more money or credit left the bankers were not in a better condition and the merchants had neither merchandise nor money the inconvenience of proclaiming money to go at a lower price was sensibly perceived every day more and more and the public misery still increased a man cannot sufficiently wonder that things of so great a consequence were managed with so little consideration nay matters were come to that pass that in several provinces they were forced to exchange cattle for corn and cloth for linen because there was not money enough to circulate in the way of trade heaven pitied the great afflictions of those people and favored them with a plentiful year but the price of bread was not in the least diminished either through the negligence or villainy of the magistrates who were so far from encouraging the corn to be brought into the great cities that they underhand hindered it from being carried to those places the queenmothers household began to find in their turn the effects of these disorders she had been hitherto very well paid and her domestics received their racions that is to say their allowances either in money or provisions and now when they pressed the treasurers to take care they might have them they were told that they might go and visit the chests of the treasury if they pleased which at present were all open because they had no money within  so many particular as well as private calamities were yet increased by the ravage and desolation the plague made in andalusia it is not long ago since it was altogether uninhabited along the seacoasts from malaga to alicant the kingdom of granada was not free from this pestilence which spread it self about sevil and corduba and in estramadura it was immediately perceived at port st mary but they would not take any public notice of it till after the departure of the flota for the indies for fear of spoiling commerce if it had not been for this consideration it had been visibly perceived much sooner the difficulties still increased as to the business of trade and people were apprehensive that their letters commodities and goods carried the infection with them it is natural enough for men to use all necessary precaution against so dangerous a distemper as this was  i have already observed that the duke de medinaceli would have fain engaged the king to part with his confessor but that finding so many difficulties appear in the way he desisted from his design but father francis de relux had not for his part forgotten the ill offices that the duke endeavored to do him he dissembled his resentments because he was not as yet so well settled in the kings good inclinations as to venture to cope with the chief minister but as soon as he found himself upon sure grounds he spoke to de eguya and the duchess de terra nova to interest them in his quarrel out of a desire he had to make the duke sensible of the effects of his power the old duchess was not ignorant that the duke hated her and that he passionately desired to see another in her place this inspired her with a mortal aversion to him and so these three persons being always united raised a considerable faction against him but that of the confessor was carried on more secretly and consequently was more dangerous it often happens that a man pursues his revenge freely when he may safely do it under the pretense of devotion and this was the case of father de relux for he incessantly attacked the king in his most tender part his conscience he represented to him the misery of his people the extremity of the state the disorder and miscarriages which were so far from being remedied that they were openly encouraged that no grievances were redressed that every thing came to ruin that if his majesty was sensible that he had not power and experience enough to regulate affairs of himself and to take the reins of the government into his own hands he ought at least to entrust them with a minister who would give him an honest and faithful account of his employment that the debate was not now about a trivial matter but that his everlasting salvation lay at stake that god who makes and preserves kings in their sovereign authority expects that kings should perform their duties that they are obliged to cherish their subjects as their children and to make them happy as far as it lies in their power that the duke de medina celi only regarded his own private interests and minded nothing but his family which was very numerous and the advancing of his relations whilst the rest of spain groaned under the heavy weight of subsidies imposts and a thousand other vexations which were purposely raised to exhaust them that he was obliged in conscience to inform him that unless he vigorously endeavored to apply proper remedies to these evils it was his duty to deny him absolution the king who continued for some time astonished at these menaces demanded of him whether he did not speak all these afflicting things only to try him the other answered that he was so far from entertaining any such thoughts that were so little conformable to the respect he owed him that he would willingly have sacrificed his own life to have been exempted from the cruel necessity of speaking to him after so frank a manner the king was very pensive and spent several days in consulting himself without knowing what to resolve upon he loved the duke de medina celi exceedingly and at last sent for him to come to him so having shut him up with himself in his closet he fairly acquanted him with the occasion of his uneasieness and with his apprehensions in relation to his salvation he recounted to him every thing that past between his confessor and him and how he refused to absolve him because of the general disorder of affairs and at last told the duke he had now sent for him to comfort him with good reasons the chief minister listened very respectfully to him all the while and would not suffer himself to be transported with any passion against the confessors severity for fear the king should suspect the true motives of that heat on the contrary he agreed that he was indeed a man of sincerity and that his advices seemed to proceed from a good intent but then he added that he was a monk and had no manner of experience in the world that don juan had drawn him out of a convent where he lay buried that he never had any conversation but with monks like himself that he was dazzled with the post to which by the favor of don juan he had been elevated all on the sudden that his head was giddy and that he knew not how to make any difference between things and times although this was an article absolutely necessary in the conduct of souls that he placed the kings soul in a parallel with that of a private man that he agreed indeed that in the sight of god one were as valuable as the other and that all the difference that was to be found between them proceeded only from the diversity of their works but then every man had a particular way to save himself that a prince ought to live like a prince and a private man like a private man and so after the same manner a secular like a secular and a religious like a religious that father relux whose capacity was very narrow confounded all estates and even lost himself in this chaos that his majesty ought not to be disturbed at what he had told him and especially least of all in the present affairs because he assured him for his part that he would not lose a moment to set them in the best order imaginable that in truth it was necessary to allow some time for the performance of this that let a mans zeal be never so earnest for the public good yet he cannot effect it immediately since it is full as difficult a matter to remedy grievances as it is easy to desire the removal of them but that since the confessor had troubled himself with several things which did not at all belong to him if the king would be pleased to take his advice he would provide him with one who was more capable of the post than f relux and would never torment him with impertinent scruples  the duke found it an easy matter to persuade his majesty to embrace a thing that would set his conscience at rest and the king had consented that very moment to the removal of the confessor if he had not judged it necessary to take the advice of don geronimo de eguya and so he told the duke that he would make a few reflections as was requisite upon the matter de eguya coming to wait upon the king he communicated his designs to him after the strict union that was between this favorite the duchess de terra nova and father relux there was little probability that he would consent to his removal but as he preferred his own interests to those of other persons and only served others out of a respect to his own advantage so he found that the confessor was so devoted to the camarera mayor and that she so resolutely swore the downfall of the duke that if this combination continued much longer the duke would infalllibly fall under the weight of it that his successor might perhaps have less favorable dispositions toward him and that he had better sacrifice the confessor to the minister than the minister to the confessor these reasons appeared so wellgrounded that instead of inspiring other sentiments into the king he fortified those he had already and this was enough to ruin the father confessor to all intents and purposes they offered him as they did before the bishopric of avila in order to observe some sort of decency in removing him but he would not accept of it and was content to continue a counselor in the supreme council of the inquisition where they are always obliged to have a dominican the duke de medina celi persuaded the king to take in his place father bayona a dominican professor of the university of alcala he had expressed a great desire long before to see him placed in this station and had spoke of him ever since the ministry of don juan that prince who had no kindness for him would never admit him saying that he was a frenchman he was indeed a native of navar but that was the spanish navar he entered into this function toward the end of july it is very observable that in the space of five years the king had seven confessors  this alteration gave a fatal blow to the duchess de terra nova and the chief minister flattered himself that she would now leave the palace in a short time since people spoke no more of sending her away and she was well informed of every thing that past she was of opinion that they could not find any lady who was fit to succeed her in her place and that she should still continue in it but the queen finding all her stock of patience spent and gone by reason of all those occasions of complaint she still persisted to give her consented at last to receive the duchess de albuquerque near her person but this was not till after she had endeavored to obtain the marchioness de los velez and even the duchess de linfantado she saw very well that the queen mother and the chief minister would never give their consent to it and that it was indispensably necessary for her to take a camarera major from their hands or else to rest contented with whom she now had every one gave the duchess de albuquerque a good character to efface those ill impressions she had received against her they took care to satisfy her that she was ingenious and wellread in the world that she was not ignorant of any of the customs and ceremonies of the court that she would do her all good offices imaginable both with the queen mother and the duke de medina celi that she had better make this choice freely and voluntarily than express any repugnance to a thing which would unavoidably happen these reasons had their effect the queen accepted her and received her very kindly when she saw her she had concerted the matter with the queen her motherinlaw and the duke de medina celi but this was not sufficient the kings consent remained still to be gained and he was no less averse to the duchess de albuquerque than to the marchioness de los velez the prejudices he had received against this duchess were of the same nature with those that had been insinuated into the queen the duchess de terra nova and the secretary de eguya were the persons who had thus maliciously prepossessed him against her and nothing less than all the authority of the queen mother could make him resolve to admit her into the palace she spoke to him of it at first very softly and gently but afterward in a stronger and higher tone she told him that it was high time for him now to know people of himself and not to judge of their merits by what was whispered to him concerning them that any person might be so unhappy as to have secret enemies and that he was in a miserable condition to depend always upon those that possessed his ear when he perceived the queen mother to speak to him after this manner he opposed the business no longer and so every thing was adjusted don pedro de arragon received orders on the twentieth of august to acquaint the duchess de terra nova with the queens intentions and with the reasons she pretended to assign against her conduct that the best way she could take would be to obey without resistance and to make it appear as well as she could that she retired of her own accord  this blow did not surprise her since she was long ago prepared for it by the private whisperings that were spread about the court she answered don pedro de arragon in a very few words and could not yet bring her self to believe that the king had given his consent to her removal so she was resolved to be satisfied of the truth of it from his own mouth she waited to speak with him as he was just going to sit down to dinner and entertained him for some time in a low tone at last raising her voice to a higher pitch she demanded leave of him to retire the king answered her aloud i give you my consent madam you may retire as soon as you please these few words were like to discompose all the constancy of the duchess she changed color several times and advanced a few steps to speak in private with him again but he turned his back toward her and asked something or other of the duke de uzeda she went hastily out of the room and retired to her chamber to compose her self again but the disorder she was in would not permit her to appear before the queen till evening and then she came to wait upon her at supper and at her going to bed with as unconcerned an air as if nothing had passed though to counterfeit this gave her a great deal of trouble because she was thoroughly netled the queen was informed by the king of what he had said to her however she had the goodness not to discover any thing of it although she had no reason to be wellpleased with her  next morning the duchess who had not gone to bed but had passed the whole night walking in her chamber with the dutchesses de monteleon and de hijar her two daughters only waited till the queen was up to go and take her leave of her her visage was more pale than ordinary and her eyes more red and fiery she then approached the queen and without weeping or showing the least concern told her she was very sorry that she had not served her so well as she wished the queen who was a person of wonderful tenderness could not forbear to seem somewhat touched and to relent a little but as she was saying some obliging things to comfort her the duchess interrupted her and told her with an imperious air that a queen of spain ought not to weep for so inconsiderable a matter that the camarera who came to succeed her in her place would acquit her self better of her duty and so without saying a word more she took hold of the queens hand and making a show of kissing it immediately retired when every one about the court knew that she was to go away they came to her apartment shedding tears either through policy inclination or weakness she did not seem to them to be in the least afflicted and casting her eyes on all sides she said i thank heaven this is a place where i shall never set my foot again i am going to taste the sweets of repose and to find tranquillity at my own house i will go to sicily there i shall meet with no such disgusts as i have found at madrid in saying these words she struck her fist twice upon a little table that stood near her and taking a very pretty china fan she broke it in two threw it upon the ground and stamped it under her feet  thus she was sent away a few days after the father confessor she that never thought of leaving the court as well by reason of the ascendant she had got over the king as because it was a thing without a president till now to remove the queens camarera major unless it so happened that she desired it her self it is easy to imagine the grief she felt upon this occasion however to comfort her in some measure it was resolved to bestow the viceroyship of gallicia upon the duke de hijar her soninlaw and the order of the fleece upon the duke de monteleon who had married her granddaughter they were likewise willing still to continue to her the honors and the appointments belonging to her place but as soon as she was informed of the good intentions of the court toward her she proudly said that she would refuse every thing they could offer her and that this was to give her incense forsooth and break her nose with the censer  as soon as she was departed from the palace the duchess de albuquerque went thither to take possession of her apartment and though she had the character of a proud haughty woman yet she did not make it appear that she intended to copy after the duchess de terra novas conduct on the other hand she entertained all people with a world of respect and civility and expressed the greatest affection imaginable for the young queen this lady was widow to the duke de albuquerque who was chief of the family de la cueva and was fifty years old i always saw her wear a little bandore of black taffata which reached down as low as her eyebrows and bound her forehead so hard that her eyes were swelled with it she was a woman of great wit and reading and on certain days in the week held assemblies at her house where all the learned were well received she had only one daughter whom she married to the youngest brother of the late duke de albuquerque to keep up the name of the family she was passionately devoted to the queenmothers party and people did not doubt but that she would use the young queen very well they were afterward confirmed in this opinion when they heard the king a little after her admittance to court tell the queen that he would have her take her pleasure more than she had hitherto done that she must walk abroad and ride on horseback and that he was willing she might go to bed late provided he might go to bed at eight a clock as his custom was nay he was so very complaisant a few days after as to resolve not to go to bed till ten this agreeable alteration in his conduct gave the world occasion to conjecture that the duchess de albuquerque had engaged the queen mother to speak to the king in favor of her and that the severity which the queen had hitherto undergone had been inspired into the king only by the means of the duchess de terra nova  the marquess de caralvo who was of the council of state died about this time he left prodigious sums of ready money behind him and the crown gained by his death sixty seven thousand crowns which was yearly given him by way of pension the admiral of castiles lady died likewise and as he had lived after a very indifferent manner with her always and was one of the greatest admirers of the fair sex in all the world so he did not overmuch complain for his wifes death nor was oversorrowful to become a widower he had accustomed her to see near fifteen or sixteen of his mistresses live in his house with him in very fine apartments and all different and he was sometimes so malicious when she walked out in the garden as to look out of a window with one of these creatures standing by him who let her handkerchief or a ribbon drop and the admiral would call to his wife to take it up and bring it to the person to whom it belonged which she submitted to do with a respect and patience that all the world admired  it happened to be said at court that a certain man was found digging in the ground very early in the morning over against the imperial college his design was to take up some money and jewels which a jew who had been burnt and whose domestic he was had buried in that place the king ordered him to bring what he had found there it was all locked up in a little iron chest which was full of pieces of gold of several sorts and amongst the rest there were two pictures which i have seen bigger than my hand and in circled round with diamonds of a considerable value about them were two little scrowls of parchment with some writing upon them upon one the duchess de chievreuse and on the other the duchess de montbazon it was judged that the jews who traffic much and lend money upon pawns came perhaps by these pictures after the same manner they were perfectly finished and the ladies were both of admirable beauty the king said that they ought to be sent to the escurial  i often had the happiness to see the marchioness de liche who was one of the most beautiful and agreeable persons at court her husband was a man of infinite wit he was much against his will ambassador at rome and when he was to go thither endeavored all the ways in the world to break off his voyage he tarried a long time upon the coasts of spain and was unwilling to depart pretending that he was ill and praying them to send another in his room to whom he offered to give all his equipage as a free gift or else to trust him for it at his choice but the court was afraid of the vivacity of his genius and he was known to be a man of enterprise for this reason it was thought convenient to keep him at a distance and so they sent him fresh orders to depart and go to rome he appeared there with a great magnificence and supported the honor of his ministry very well when the duke de medina celi was made chief minister he writ several letters to him and employed the interest of all his family to get himself recalled it was positively denied him because he was feared now more than ever and it was apprehended in case he returned home that he would unite himself with his brother the count de monterei to these reasons of state the duke de medina celi joined some private ones that purely respected his own proper interest for it was an easy matter to take advantage of the absence of the marquess de liche to have a certain law suit determined which was depending between them  the marquess being informed of what had happened and despairing ever to surmount those obstacles which the duke laid in his way thought the surest expedient to get himself recalled home would be to disgust the pope upon all occasions and herein he acquitted himself so dexterously and did every thing to displease the pope after so disobliging a manner that his holiness sent the king word that unless he would recall the marquess de liche he must resolve to leave rome entreating him to send another ambassador in his place since he had never seen so disagreeable a one as this in all his life but they answered him that one of the reasons which inclined them to continue him still at rome was because his holiness had declared that he would grant the rights of the franchises and the immunities of their quarter only to those ambassadors who were then resident in rome and that those who were to be sent in their room for the time to come should no more enjoy them  the pope perceiving that he tormented himself in vain and that if he for his part had good reasons to demand the recalling of the marquess de liche the court of spain had also theirs to deny it did not renew his importunities any more but being resolved to do all the ill offices he could to the ambassador who had on purpose disobliged him as far as lay in his power he found an opportunity to quit scores with him and he took his advantage of it with pleasure it was about a dispensation which the marquess de liche demanded of him in favor of don pedro de arragon his uncle to marry donna catalina de la cerda daughter to the duke de medina celi  this young lady was niece to don pedro de arragon who was brother to the duke de cardonne and to the cardinal of arragon and the duke de cardonne was father to the duchess de medina celi so that there was an absolute necessity for a dispensation the marquess was entrusted with the procuring of it by his uncle who writ him word that he should die contentedly if he could but leave an heir of his name and estate behind him that after he had been twice married without getting any children he hoped his third match would prove more fortunate to him and therefore he desired him not to lose a moment to obtain of the pope what he desired the ambassador omitted nothing to compass it and gave himself a great deal of trouble and pains to no purpose they still put him off and sent him sometimes to one and sometimes to another cardinal in fine after having made him dance attendance long enough till he had lost all manner of patience they bluntly told him that they could by no means grant what he demanded and that the pope made a scruple of giving a dispensation to a man who was seventy years old to marry his niece who was not yet sixteen the ambassador sensibly resented this refusal and sent speedy notice of it to don pedro de arragon but what gave him a new occasion to be more displeased was to hear that at the very moment when don pedro was reading his letter at madrid the nuncio brought him a dispensation that was expedited gratis and told him that he had received it much sooner if the marquess de liche had not appeared in the matter don pedro sent his nephew word of all these circumstance who was exceedingly vexed at it the marriage was concluded on the    th of  without any ceremony at the house of the duke de medina celi where cardinal portocarero married them  all the spanish officers at naples were enjoined to reassume the spanish dress twas believed that the neapolitans would soon imitate them but seeing they did it not in the least an ordinance was published by sound of trumpet at the beginning of august commanding all the officers of justice to apparel themselves after the spanish fashion this conduct had never been used toward them had it not been to let them see how great a heartburning it was to them to behold them dressed after the french way the troops continued still to make complaints because it was a long time since they had been paid off they spoke several times to the viceroy about it who sent them to the secretary of war and he to the cashkeeper or play master to the army he answered them that the military funds were clearly exhausted and that he was not in a condition to satisfy them this makes it sufficiently appear that the extreme misery which indeed oppressed the whole spanish monarchy was not only perceived at madrid  the king being fully resolved to endeavor as far as in him lay the ease and satisfaction of his people and thinking himself obliged to the performance of it by those things which father francis de relux had said to him at the time when he was his confessor acquainted the duke de medina celi with his designs to establish a particular council where all manner of affairs should be debated and it should be composed of the constable of castile the marquess de los balbazez the inquisitor general and don melchior navarra the chief minister was to be the head of it but the king reserved to himself the last resolutions of things and all favors and disposals of places the duke approved at first of the kings project but after he had maturely deliberated upon it he went to the king on purpose to dissuade him from it out of an assurance that the council of state would be jealous of it which was composed of some of the most considerable persons in the kingdom that this would occasion a vexatious difference between them and rather hinder the success and advancement of affairs than promote them don melchior navarra vice chancellor of arragon obtained all the appointments and profits which the presidents of that council were formerly used to enjoy  it was not at all questioned but that the queen mother advanced the duchess de albuquerque to the place where now she was to be seen and people were as fully persuaded that it was she who got the prince de parma to be sent into flanders to recompense the great zeal he had always expressed in her service but the council of state began to be alarmed at the great power of this princess what is the matter would they usually say one to another are we going to have a new regency and is the king resolved to be under wardship again what gave them the greatest occasion to talk after this manner was as follows the council having according to the custom named three subjects for the viceroyship of peru out of which number the king generally chooses one his majesty without having any regard to it named don melchior navarra who had advanced his fortune by the means of the queen mother and was absolutely devoted to her he was born in arragon of an obscure family and at first was an advocate and afterward a counselor at naples being come to madrid he there became fiscal to the council of arragon and had the good fortune to please the queen mother who was then regent she made him vice chancellor of arragon which is one of the most considerable places out of pure spite to the council of state who opposed her so that she could not bestow this office upon the prince de stillano the juncto of the government refusing to admit him she put the other in his place that she might always have one of her own creatures in that juncto and besides this might always be informed for the time to come of what was transacted there  the queen had no sooner given this testimony of her affection to don melchior but every body stood surprised to see a man of so mean a birth advanced to so high a post but when they knew him better they found him to be a person of great merit experience and probity don juan of austria who was mightily displeased at his conduct banished him and he came not back to court till after the death of that prince  the queen mother being desirous to make him completely happy got the viceroyship of peru for him which is a very advantageous post for in less than five years time a man may very well heap up three millions by it without wronging either his own conscience or his neighbor just at his departure they charged him with very rigorous orders against the governors of that kingdom who had made an ill use of their power this custom has been taken up of a long time the poor and unfortunate only are made examples but the rest make a shift to escape well enough by giving a good round sum of money which perhaps they have extorted from other people but as it always happens that one mans good fortune proves an obstacle to that of another the marquess de santa crux died of grief because he mist this place he had been general of the spanish galleys and was a man of birth and merit but so extremely poor that he saw nothing else could set him up again but the viceroyship of peru  he did not question but that they would consider him for the services of his ancestors and remember that the count de chinchon his father who had been councellor of state was always faithful to the crown and that they would examine his own personal merit he flattered himself that all these considerations would infallibly procure him the viceroyship of peru he came on purpose to madrid to solicit for it but when he saw don melchior navarra preferred before him he could not master his grief and died within few days after his death was attended by that of one of the dearest persons in the world to him donna antonia de la cerda daughter to the duke de medina celi and wife to the son of the marquess de villa manriquez she was very young and yet extremely agreeable  the ambassador of the estates of the uninited provinces had audience of the king on the twentieth of august he demanded of him the payment of several millions that were due from the crown of spain to the admiralty of holland ever since the year      the king was only pleased to say veremos and that evening having sent for the duke de medina celi to come to him i have never says he seen so many debts and so little money to pay them if this holds i will give no more audience to those to whom i am indebted the duke told him he hoped that in a short time things would be in a better condition and that the hollanders were rich enough to stay a little longer for their money  people talked very strangely at madrid of the kings recalling the duke de veraguas who was viceroy of valentia this little kingdom is as it were annexed to that of arragon and is a place where there never fail to be abundance of murderers robbers and cutthroats the malignant influence that reigns here makes the men naturally so bad that when there is any ill action to be done they make use of the bandoleros who are a sort of banditti divided into several factions and have each of them their chief who are generally seditious persons capable of all the villainies in the world an apostatized monk took shelter amongst them and they found him to be so resolute and hardened a fellow that they chose him for their captain but as it happened the very moment he came to commit an assassinate he was taken with his sword in his hand he could not deny so palpable a crime and the viceroy was advised to execute speedy justice upon him the viceroy was well enough satisfied that he ought to serve him so but what gave him some trouble was this that having to deal with a religious he thought that he ought to use more formality with him another reason likewise stopped him a little for by the laws of valentia some days are allotted to criminals after they are condemned before their execution he ordered four religious of different orders to meet and consulted them upon these two heads two of them were of opinion that he might take cognizance of this matter with the archbishops consent the two others maintained that although the laws of the country allow some time to a guilty person and that this was a monk belonging to the ecclesiastical jurisdiction yet for all that the kings service demanded a speedy and severe example and that the actions of this man were so abominably odious that he deserved to have no respect shown him the duke de veraguas was of their opinion and ordered him to be hanged immediately the ecclesiastics demanded him before execution the archbishop supported them by his authority and when he knew it was to no purpose his official published an interdict the people immediately made an insurrection and the viceroy was obliged to shut himself up in his palace but being besieged on every side and apprehending some danger from the violence of the rabble he escaped out of the city well accompanied the archbishop lost no time to inform the court of what had happened the duke too sent thither as soon and each of them alleged their reasons upon this the king ordered a juncto to sit composed of his own confessor a jesuit and a dominican it happened well for the archbishop that he was of the same order with this last and had been general of his order he wanted no more to gain the cause the duke de veraguas was condemned with one consent and a sum of money was remitted to him with orders to come within twenty leagues of madrid and there to wait the kings farther pleasure on the twenty sixth of august the count de aquilar was named to succeed him in his place and within    hours after he departed to go and take possession of it  if this affair the judgment whereof appeared too rigorous made so great a noise the connivance shown to the marquess de las navas viceroy of sicily surprised people no less he merely for a humor persecuted the archbishop of palermo so as to make him leave the city the king being informed of the proceedings was not only content to reprimand the viceroy for it but ordered that the archbishop should receive particular satisfaction from him he wrote a very obliging letter to this prelate wherein he acquainted him how much he was concerned at the affronts he had received and sent it to the marquess de navas with orders to deliver it to the archbishop with his own hands the viceroy received it and kept it by him but they being informed of it at court a fresh injunction was sent him he obeyed this no better than the former this stiffness and contumacy of his perfectly wearied the council without drawing the least inconvenience upon him so that they no more commanded him to deliver the letter to the archbishop it is very certain that another man would not have had this indulgence shown him but the viceroy being it seems obliged to marry his son to one of the daughters of the duke de medina celi this is one reason why he was sure to meet with good quarter as long as the duke continued in favor nevertheless the marquess de louvignies who was made governor of messina was no sooner arrived there but he was offended to see the fortifications and garrison in so ill a condition he plainly told the marquess de las navas that he could not dispense with himself from giving the court an account of these matters he was as good as his word and the viceroy received a severe check for his negligence  they had a new occasion to be displeased at madrid when they received advices of what happened at naples on the   th of september the viceroy passing through the toledostreet to go to visit the spanish nuns was stopped by an hundred troopers all armed and on horseback who audaciously demanded of him either to pay them off or else to dismiss them  so resolute an action as this was did not a little surprise him he promised to do every thing they desired of him and returned back again to the palace very suddenly as soon as he believed himself to be safe he ordered six soldiers to be sent to prison and their trials to come on speedily he reformed all the cavalry together with the captains and the other officers as well as the lieutenant general this body of horse consisted of seven troops and had been kept up above fifty years he pretended that he had received orders from madrid to reform them after this manner but the real truth is he was not in a condition to pay them the king of spain hereupon was exceedingly grieved to behold the misery to which all his kingdoms were reduced  but all this evil news was balanced when they knew that the plague was entirely ceased in andaluzia and that the chief magistrate of cales finding the port of st mary free from the infection had taken off the prohibition of commerce after this they immediately begun to load the gallions on the fifth of september there were great rejoicings at court because it was the birthday of his most catholic majesty a comedy was acted there and all the ambassadors and grandees of spain were present at it the queen appeared so covered with jewels that her diamonds cast a greater light than six large flambeaux as big as torches did that were lighted in the great hall a few days after this the king and the two queens went solemnly to chapel where the anniversary of philip iv was celebrated with great ceremonies the queen being returned to the palace found a sealed letter in her pocket having the same superscription with that which she formerly received and seeing written on the outside for the queen alone she would not open it and almost distracted her self in thinking what person it was that could find the means to come so nigh her as to slip this letter into her pocket toward evening she went along with the king to the queenmothers palace to make her the usual compliments of condolance upon the death of the late king her husband the duchess de medina celi told the king that she had received a letter from ispahan the capital city of persia which had great curiosities in it the king replied that he was desirous to hear it  all the company being gone out of the room she placed her self near him to read it the queen took her advantage of this opportunity and told the queen mother that she had a great desire to see a picture of titian which she had lately bought as she said these words she advanced toward the great closet of the queen mother whither she followed her when they had entered into it the young queen gave her the letter which she had found in her pocket and desired her to keep it or burn it as she thought most convenient i dont know says she but it may come from the duchess de terra nova but she shall be clearly mistaken in her project the queen mother told her that she had best open the letter to see what was contained in it ah madam replied the queen i would never by my good will see any such letters the queen mother admired the prudent conduct of this young princess and bid her not disquiet her self about the matter for she would take care to keep it sealed by her and some time after she recounted this adventure to the marchioness de mortare and showed her the first letter saying she believed it proceeded from the malice of some persons who designed to do the queen a mischief it was through this ladys means that my cousin and i came to know all that i have written concerning this affair  the queen and the queen mother did not tarry long together but came to find the king who told them that the duchess de medina celi had read a letter to him wherein was contained a very tragical surprising accident and that they would by no means think their time lost to hear it the duchess immediately read the letter it was dated from ispahan the    th of march    0 and gave an account how that on the    d of january in the same year the city of masulipatan which is the greatest scale of trade in the kingdom of golconda had been overflowed by the sea and by extraordinary rains accompanied with a furious hurricane that above twenty five thousand persons were drowned there and that the loss of the goods and merchandise amounted to twenty millions that it had rained blood for the space of two hours in the village of sohou near deli where the great mogul keeps his residence and that part of the city of sougean near daera had been overwhelmed by an earthquake that the english having received advice that the raja sevagi after he had pillaged the city of danga threatened to besiege bombay which is a place that was yielded up by the portugueses to them together with tangier upon occasion of the marriage of the infanta catharina queen of england had sent some men of war to bombay to defend it but that it was very much questioned whether they would be able to hold in out against a prince who continued to make his conquests with so prodigious a swiftness and who had already defeated cercan loudi a prince dependent upon the king of visiapour he had possessed himself in less than two years of all the territory situate upon the coasts of coromandel the king of visiapour being concerned at the misfortune of this prince who was just upon the point of marrying the princess famika his sister designed to assist him and sent his forces under the command of famika who was as brave as an amazon beautiful and haughty the prince sevagi knowing that she marched against him advanced with his army and met her toward the kingdom of golconda she sent a zagay to him with a sabre and writ to him that in case he was so pleased they would decide the quarrel by a single combat he accepted the challenge took the arms she sent him and returned her others the two armies were drawn out in battle with orders not to make the least movement as long as the combat continued the princess was vanquished and surrendered her self prisoner the prince cercan loudi who was with her was driven into despair when he saw his mistress taken away from him he threw himself with his forces upon those of sevagi and after a long combat cercan was taken prisoner and the prince remained master of the field after this he still carried famika along with him and she appeared so charming to him that he told her if she was willing to marry him he would restore to cercan loudi all that he had taken from him by way of conquest the princess haughtily replied that she would never sacrifice her self to one that was a subject to the king her brother sevagi who was deeply in love with her dispatched an envoy to the king of visiapour to demand famika of him and promised that if he would bestow that princess upon him he would serve him as his vassal the king scorned the proposal treating him as a revolted subject whom he knew well enough how to chastise when the other saw that gentle methods signified nothing he presently fell a ravaging the country of visiapour from surat to goa except six or seven places upon the coasts so that his conquests extended as far as negapatan and this in all made near   0 leagues in length he always carried his fair prisoner along with him hoping to gain her by his respect and complaisance but having had one day a very long conversation with her upon this topic wherein she declared that all the injuries either she or those of her family suffered at his hands only served to provoke her the more and that she would never love any one but cercan loudi the love of sevagi was in a moment turned into fury and he had the cruelty to cause a scaffold to be erected for her where with his own hands he cut off the head of the young princess famika and her lover  the queen mother having a great kindness for the marchioness de grana received two of her daughters who were very lovely and well shaped into the number of her ladies  a short time after the king the two queens and all the court departed for aranjuez but the house not being large enough to lodge half the officers and ladies they came back every night and lay near it the duke de uzeda the count de altamire and the two sons of the duke of alva disguised themselves like muleteers with bonnets after the english fashion pulled over their heads to hide them and being dressed after fashion they went every day on foot by the boot of the coach of the queens maids of honor to court their mistresses as the custom is there  although the king had prohibited all persons in general and married people in particular los galanteos de palacio as they call it at madrid yet he was not able to hinder it it has been a thing established time out of mind amongst them to entertain the ladies of the court with their gallantry although they have not the least design to marry them and they wait upon them with as much assiduity as if they were already betrothed to them but what is the strangest as well as the least pardonable thing of all is that they ruin themselves by it i have feen married men nay even those that were grandfathers totally taken up in an amor with one of the ladies of the court the women whose husbands are led away with these extravagant fancies are extremely disgusted at it and this often occasions horrid disorders in their families but all that these cavaliers pretend to reap by their passion is only that their mistresses will suffer them to come and stop under their windows here they sit in the back part of their coaches and entertain them by their fingers and the ladies answer them after the same manner without speaking to them but only upon days of ceremony for at that time they have the liberty to accost them before all the world but what is very surprising and was never yet practiced any where else the ladies of honor belonging to the queen receive jewels apparel and considerable sums of money from their gallants the dukes de montalte and de medina sidonia having no office to oblige them to follow the court to aranjuez sent their stewards cooks and other servants with gold and silver plate to carry magnificent repasts to their mistresses as long as they staid at aranjuez  the diversion there is but little because the greatest pleasure one can take is to walk along the sides of the river tagus which wash the banks of the finest walks in the world but the rains were so great that no body could stir out when there was the least fair weather the queen rode on horseback with all her ladies but one of them had the mischance to be carried away by her horse and received so much hurt by her fall that she died within three days after this ill accident troubled the king exceedingly so that by his good will he would not suffer the queen to ride when he saw her not he would still be crying let some body go to see how my queen does and bring me word whether she is fallen off her horse the king was informed at aranjuez that two portuguese men of war in their return to lisbon had met a french vessel commanded by the chevalier de leti he demanded the salute of them and upon their refusing to do it gave them a broadside which they answered with all their guns but after a long dispute he obliged them to strike the flag after this the vessel continued its course toward villa franca where the ambassador of savoy waited to be carried over to portugal upon this the king  spain told the duke de medina celi that there was no question to be made but his galleys would be served after the same manner if they were not better provided  the king had a mighty desire when he parte from madrid to go immediately to the escuria but he could not fully resolve to carry the quee along with him thither till he had staid some time at some of the other houses belonging to the kings of spain he had been told that it was looked upon to be an ill omen to go first to the place where the royal tombs are and since the queen had as yet been only at buen retiro a la casa del campo at pardo and zarzuela which are so near madrid that she just rested her self there a few hours after she came from hunting he was resolved to begin with aranjuez to avert and frustrate those evil presages therefore he ordered every thing to be in readiness for his journey by the beginning of september which is one of the finest months of the year in spain but the ministers not finding money enough in the treasury to defray the expenses of the progress dexterously endeavored to put it by though in all appearance they seemed to desire it as much as the king did and daily ordered mules to be got ready to carry the baggage they pretended the ways were dangerous and bad and at last that the great rains had corrupted the air nay they sent for some physicians with whom they had been practicing to confirm all they said notwithstanding these reasons the king still persisted in his resolution to go to aranjuez and did not know till the very evening before he was to depart that he could not go he was the only person that was ignorant of it for the ministers had acquainted their friends with it above twelve days before and all the city was informed that the king was to stay at madrid still the queen was not a little displeased at these proceedings she spoke to the king about it and told him that the ministers might now very well forbear to use them any longer like children that if there had been any important reasons why they should not go to aranjuez they ought to have given them timely notice of it but to put them off and speaking properly to fool them after this insufferable rate was never to be endured the king was vexed and told the queen that this should be the last time he would suffer such things at their hands and that they should direct themselves for the future only by his will and pleasure this discourse was overheard by some of the gentlemen of the bedchamber who went presently to acquaint the duke de medina celi with it to make their court by this means he was terribly disheartened and feared lest the queen who was charming and witty might come to get a greater ascendent over the kings inclinations than he desired and therefore that he might not displease the king any more used all imaginable diligence to provide a fund sufficient to bear the expenses of going to aranjuez and the escurial till this very moment he had resolved to break off these two journeys but he apprehended a great deal of danger from the queens dissatisfaction and so to get a sum necessary for the occasion he sold two offices of the contador major for twenty five thousand crowns and received forty more for a government in the indies he took fifty thousand crowns out of an hundred thousand that were to be laid out in equipping of the gallions he made use of the money gathered for custom that was to have paid off the rights of the franchises and the revenues of the town hall in a word every thing was got ready by that time the court came back from aranjuez for them to go to the escurial however the king was not able to go as soon as he desired by reason that the ill weather increased ever since the beginning of september never a day passed without violent tempests accompanied by dreadful claps of thunder the lightning struck abundance of persons in several places and the hail fell so thick and in such prodigious quantities in the forest of the pardo which is an house of pleasure belonging to the king that it broke the branches of the greatest trees and killed so many birds and wildfowl that both the fields and the river of mancanarez were covered with them and it was the most surprising sight in the world to behold the ancient bridge de aranda de duero was carried away by the waters of that river and the tagus over flowed its banks with that impetuosity that it did an incredible mischief to the pleasant walks at aranjuez so many accidents of which they received fresh news daily troubled the court exceedingly for there was scarce a place in spain exempt from these continual tempests one of them happened on the    th of september in so outrageous a manner that the gardens of the countess de ognate which are the finest in madrid were overflown in a moment the water entered into the lower apartments of her house where she kept her noblest italian paintings and her richest movables and all was entirely spoiled by this inundation the torrent to work out its passage threw down the gardenwalls and broke into that belonging to our ladys de atocha the next night we all thought that madrid would be beaten down about our ears by the thunderclaps the lightning the wind the rain and the hail i dont believe any body went to bed in the whole city the churches were full of people who confessed as if the hour of death were approaching the water of the mancanarez swelled exceedingly and spread it self on all sides the king and the queen who impatiently waited for daylight went in devotion to our ladys de atocha but at their return they found the pardo overflown and though a coach had been overturned a little before by the apidity of the torrent the king believed that his might pass it well enough and commanded the coachman to advance speedily forward toward the bridge of the barelegged augustines within a few paces of the bridge the two fore mules which in spain are at a pretty distance from the hindmost were overturned by the impetuosity of the water the postillion that led them escaped very narrowly the mules recovered themselves twice and were thrown down as often the king was all alone in the coach with the queen very much concerned and telling her that he was in pain only for her sake in the mean time some people got hold by the traces and so drew out the coach by meet strength by this means the mules got out of the water but their majestys could not reach the palace and being affrighted at the great danger they had just escaped were obliged to go to buenretiro where they tarried till midnight and waited for the waters to fall  the marquess de los velez viceroy of naples dispatched a courier to court to give them advice that the pope had demanded of them to send the marquess sera a genoese to him who was excommunicated for falling foul upon the apostolic nuncios courier on maundy thursday the brief specified that his holiness grounded his pretensions upon the right  sovereignty the holy see had to the kingdom  naples the officers of all the courts of judicature assembled upon it and resolved not to comply with the popes desires by reason of the ill consequences that might attend such an affair but the king and the ministers here could not forbear to wonder that his holiness spoke of renewing his pretensions which seemed to be adjusted a long time ago  the only son of the marquess de castelrodrigo died about the beginning of october as did also don rui gomez de silva brother to the duke de hijar we may say they were two of the most handsome and hopeful lords at court this last was mightily devoted to donna isabella de mendoza a lady of great beauty who was not completely seventeen years old she took the death of her lover so much to heart that without acquainting her mother with it she got out of her house covered in a mantle and went to the a monastery founded by joanna sister to philip iv descalsas reales there to take upon her the religious habit  their majestys parted from madrid on the   th of october to go to the escurial the king only carried with him the duke de medina celi the grand master of the household with two masters of the house in ordinary the great forester and the first gentleman of the bedchamber and two other lords in the same office don geronimo de eguya secretary of state and the marquess de grana ambassador from the emperor the admiral of castile who was master of the horse did not arrive there till fourteen days after the king he was naturally so lazy even when he was obliged to make his court that he could not resolve in a less time to go to the escurial  all the ladies of the court and six women of the bedchamber accompanied the queen the marquess de villa maina chief gentleman of the bedchamber and the marquess de astorgas grand master of the household went along with her as for the duke de ossone who was master of the horse to her he tarried at madrid upon the account of a new disgust he had received at court the king was willing that the queen should ride on horseback to take a few turns in the walks of the meadows and to meet him as he came from hunting she had four fits of an ague but the following ones were so gentle that she was able to get up a few days after and divert her self as she had used to do ever since her arrival to the escurial  the king who was altogether taken up with the pleasures of hunting pursued the sport from sun rising till night one day he ordered a chase to be prepared after the german manner they had toils which enclosed a great quantity of ground and here with their guns they killed above two hundred bucks and does the queen was at first desirous to be there but being informed after what manner they used these poor creatures she imagined that such a sight would rather give her occasion to employ her pity than afford her any pleasure the king in all his chaces generally took no more with him than the first gentleman of the bedchamber and the great forester he loved to find himself alone in vast solitudes and sometimes it was a long while before they could find him when he hunted after the german manner he would be accompanied by the duke de medina celi and the marquess de grana at his return the chief minister following the king to the queens apartment found that her majesty did not cast her eyes upon him he immediately penetrated into the reason of this alteration he found in the queens behavior for to say the truth she was displeased with him for dissuading his majesty to expedite a patent for a government in the indies which he had granted to her but when the duke knew it he told the king that the queen begged this grace of him at the entreaty of one of the women of her bedchamber who was a french woman who would get considerably by it when in the mean time twelve thousand pistoles were offered for it the king thought it was the best way to take this sum and after this would not hear the least word of dispatching the patent as he had promised  but what provoked the queen infinitely more was the conduct he had used in her absence toward the constable colonnas lady the duchess de medina celi had passed her word to the queen as in her husbands name that during the stay her majesty made at the escurial nothing should be done to the prejudice of this lady notwithstanding these assurances upon which she depended she was carried away from madrid and by an order from the king confined to the castle of segovia to begin this story from its original the reader is to know that this lady was niece to the late cardinal mazarine she brought a very considerable fortune with her at her marriage and perhaps the family of the colonnas had sunk very low without this seasonable relief after she had passed the happiest and most pleasant part of her life at rome where she always appeared in great pomp and splendour having the liberty to live after the french fashion and according to all appearances seeming to be content with her fortune she withdrew all on the sudden without so much as knowing the reason of it her self through the ill counsels of some persons who hazarded not a little upon her account in making her hazard every thing on her side so that she departed privately with the duchess of mazarine her sistet they had disguised themselves so well that none knew them when they took shipping and thus they arrived safely in france the constable colonnas lady hoped to find here a sanctuary against her husband and some vain flattering ideas that were not as yet perfectly extinguished in her heart served to persuade her that she should be well received at court but so far was she from meeting any encouragement to make her appearance there that she was prohibited by the king to come there i have heard her say that she resented this treatment with so sensible a grief that she was like to have died of it after this she went to turin where she made a short stay and the uneasiness of her mind led her at last to flanders there she happened to find the marquess de borgomaine of the house of este in whom she reposed an entire considence without remembering that he was rather a friend to her husband than to her self he flattered her in all her projects in order to amuse her and to gain time till he might receive advice from the constable how to dispose of her for he had sent him a letter by a courier for that purpose to inform him that his wife was at brussels and in answer to it the constable earnestly desired him to seize and apprehend her he acquitted himself immediately of his commission and carried her to a convent from whence she was not to depart unless she would consent to be shipped for spain as they desired her when she was at madrid she delayed upon several pretenses to take the religious habit upon her she loved her liberty and was desirous still to enjoy it but the constable being informed of her arrival sent don fornand de colonna his natural brother with letters to the king and the ministers wherein he beseechd them that either by fair means or violence they would oblige his lady to enter into a convent this necessity seemed very hard to her nevertheless she submitted to it and retired to the monastery de santo domingo el real upon condition that if she happened to come out of it she would consent that the king should restore her to her husband she continued there a long time and sometimes in an evening she escaped out with one of her women and often went to walk on foot in a white mantle in the pardo where she met with many pleasant adventures because most of the women that come there are ladies adventurers and some ladies of the best quality at court take a mighty pleasure when they can go thither and are not known  the constable colonna being ceme to madrid in his way to arragon whereof he was viceroy went every day to entertain her at the grate and i have seen him show those gallantries to her which a lover may show to his mistress he departed in a very good understanding with her but when the queen made her entry she having a great desire to behold her majesty did not imagine they would hold her so strictly to the word she had given the king that in case she ever quitted the place of her confinement he should deliver her into her husbands hands so without any more a do she went to the marchioness de los balbazez her sister in law who received her very kindly and the marquess made her an entertainment that might have deceived a person of less faith than her self seeing these fair appearances she thought no more of returning to santo domingo but staid with the marchioness de los balbazez all this while he secretly endeavored to get an order from the king and as soon as he had procured it carried her to a convent within four leagues of madrid so severe a procedure afflicted her as much as it is possible for a woman to be afflicted she wrote to the queen to demand her protection and being informed that the constable was come back from arragon with his sons she obtained a permission of the king to go into some monastery or other at madrid but whether it were that she was not content to be there or that she had some other views in her head she made her escape and went strait to her husbands house she lived in one half of it made her court very regularly to the queen visited abundance of ladies and diverted her self very well  the constable left her an entire liberty to do what she pleased but when he was desirous to return to rome he talked of carrying his lady along with him thither she was migtily alarmed at it and declared that she would not go the reason was because she had got her nativity to be calculated and it was told her that if she had another child she should die this prediction was so fresh in her imagination that she would rather choose to return to her old place of retreat the king was urgent with her to explain her meaning she sent him word back again that she humbly requested him to grant her his protection in the design she had to throw her self into a convent  the king judged it convenient that the inquisitor general don melchior navarra and his confessor should meet to determine this difference between the constable and his lady the marquess de los balbazez solicited so powerfully that the juncto concluded to send her to the castle of segovia this he so passionately desired that all the last year he was perpetually troubling his brain how to do her some ill office but the constable of castile and the admiral set themselves all they could to oppose it and they were not able to obtain an order for it  they had never obtained one if the duke de medina celi had not been an enemy to the constables lady she being informed of what had past against her and what reasons she had to apprehend some mischief from her enemies cast her self at the queens feet and conjured her with tears in her eyes not to abandon her in this distress but to engage the chief minister to pass his word that nothing should be attempted against her as long as the court was at the escurial the queen interposed in this affair as i have already mentioned but notwithstanding all this precaution within eight days after her departure a counselor of the counsel royal with his officers accompanied by the constable colonna and the marquess de los balbazez who performed the office of bailiffs being all armed as if they had been going to apprehend a ringleader of robbers rather than an unfotrunate lady who was not capable of making the least resistance went about eleven a clock at night to break open the doors of her appartment although it was within her husbands house she was in her chamber when immediately an alcade of the court pretended to tie her arms with a cord seeing herself used after so ignominious a manner she took up a little knife which lay accidenttally up on the table and as she defended her self gave him a cut in the hand this resistance made the rest of the company fall upon her with that barbarous fury that they dragged the poor lady half naked as she was by the hairs of her head and so they forced oer away like one of the most miserable of her sex she was conducted after this manner all night long to the castle of segovia without expressing the least consideration either for her birth or reputation although she had given them no occasion to treat her thus for in fine she was actually at that time in her husbands house and her only crime was her refusing to return to rome with the constable although she offered to go into a convent without having the liberty ever to leave it most persons pitied her sorrowful condition and took it ill that they broke their promise to the queen and that they durst employ the kings name only to satisfy the malice and animosity of the marquess de los balbazez it was for his sake principally that they used this persecution toward the constables lady for her husband was one of the best conditioned men in the world he loved her and as he had formerly given her his consent to stay several years in a religious house so without question he had not now opposed the conditions she desired if it had not been for the marquess de los balbazez  he alone managed this affair and solicited the duke de medina celi in the constables name and that minister thinking by this means to oblige both of them gave his consent to what was demanded of him  nevertheless it was a surprising thing that he used so rude a conduct toward the on cstables lady it had been a more generous and manly part to endeavor to reconcile the present differences than to imprison a lady who was to be mother in law to his own daughter he ought to have considered that a husband and a wife are easily brought to accommodate matters and that if ever they came to be friends again his daughter would fall into the hands of the constables lady who would then be in a condition to revenge her self upon her for the injuries he had done her he might reasonably imagine that as she was rich and had a great number of near relations who made a considerable figure in the world so they would never see her oppressed without regretting her misfortunes and interesting themselves in her quarrel that they would vigorously endeavor to procure her her liberty and that at the bottom when he came to cast up his accounts he himself would get nothing but ill will by it  this affair made a great noise in the world i knew every particular circumstance of the story because i was intimately acquainted with this unfortunate lady and knew her to be of a good disposition and not given to speak ill of other people and as it was truly said of her she was never an enemy to any one but her self indeed it were to be wished she had been mistress of more discretion and had not been of so easy a temper as to believe those persons who advised her ill she was very lovely although she was not in the prime of her youth her eyes were lively quick and piercing her teeth admirable her hair blaker than jet and in a great quantity her stature noble and her leg wellshaped the queen being informed of her misfortunes was mighitily concerned at them and continued to be very angry with the duke de medina celi for not keeping his promise to her  the calamities occasioned by the plague were not the only evils which the people of spain suffered the public poverty spread it self farther still for the scarcity of provisions continued and no remedies were applied to rectify these disorders no alteration was made in the government and the chief minister seemed to be possessed with a lethargy every body hung down his head and men were so enfeebled that they had scarce strength enough to lift up their eyes and hands to heaven to implore its assistance and relief the past and present miseries made them apprehend what was to follow every one made melancholy reflections upon the sad condition of affairs which carried them farther than they desired but to complete the general calamity after they had for six weeks together beheld terrible inundations that did a world of mischief in several goodly cities these accidents were followed by an earthquake which happened two days after the kings departure to the escurial we perceived it at madrid on thh   th of october between six and seven a clock in the morning it was so violent that it made a general concussion and the most resolute persons were possessed with fear this extraordinary motion was perceived all the kingdom over and even at lisbon and other parts of portugal but the city of malaga found the saddest effects and sustained the greatest losses by it  this city is situated in the kingdom of granada upon the coasts of the mediterranean sea within twenty five leagues of the straights at the foot of a mountain upon the top of which stands a castle that commands the town and and the port it is large well peopled and rich by reason of the considerable trade they drive in spanish wine oil citrons fruits and other commodities which draw a vast number of vessels to that port its fortifications although they are old are very good and are adorned with several stately buildings which are remainders of the magnificence of the moors and the cathedral church was formerly the principal mosque  they perceived there a great trembling of the earth which lasted but a few moments however the concussions were so violent that they caused a general fear and desolation in the city by the strange disorder it occasioned the harbor and the walls on the same side with their bulwarks towers and ramparts were overthrown the sea was in so extraordinary an agitation that the fishes every where leapt out of the water the vessels that were in the port were lifted up above twenty foot high and all their sides cracked as if they had been in a real tempest so that the mariners believed they were unavoidably lost fifteen convents of men and women were ruined after that manner that scarce one stone lay upon another and in that of the observance of st francis there were fourteen persons buried in the ruins  this magnificent church which had been enlarged and beautified in the year      leaned several times on its two sides ready to overturn and yet received no damage which the inhabitants took for a miracle one thousand three hundred houses were sorely battered and more than one thousand two hundred ruined it is easy to judge what a vast number of persons must have been killed hurt and buried in this confusion as soon as the earthquake had ceased the bishop followed by his clergy and a great multitude of people went in procession to the church to implore the divine commiseration assuredly in these sorts of occasions the most irreligious hardened persons pray heartily and sincerely  the inhabitants being affrighted retired into the country fearing to be overwhelmed in the city by some new concussion but several houses fell down all about malaga a great mountain was perfectly overthrown the earth opened in abundance of places and cast up water in such prodigious quantities that great torrents were occasioned by it which swelled the rivers so as to make them overflow their banks twas observable that the wall of the church dalhavrin opened it self the breadth of four foot and afterward closed again so that the place where this fissure happened could not be discerned the jasper pillars in the same church were removed from their pedestals but afterward returned to their old place and sustained no damage at the city of velez malaga the earth opened and swallowed up a river which runs near it after this it closed again with so terrible a noise and threw up the water with so great a violence that it rose above ten pikes higher than the houses and had like to have over whelmed every thing when it fell down  several cities here were entirely overthrown and the earthquake did a great deal of mischief at sevil corduba and at jaen where places and churches and many houses were ruined it is impossible for any thing in nature to be more terrible than this was for no body knew where to save themselves and death seemed to pursue them wherever they fled  a few days after this earthquake there happened at night a tempestuous storm which overturned part of the roof of the escurial broke the crystal windows of the kings apartment and tore up abundance of trees in the garden by the roots the king perceiving the queen to be affrighted at it was so complaisant as to rise with her and sent for some company to come to her chamber and comfort her a little  it has been a custom long ago established in spain that when any thing happens the truth of which they cannot immediately discover for the ministers to suspect that france had a hand in it thus they had received certain advice that the count destries had sailed with several men of war in his company for the west indies and therefore they presently concluded that it was he who burnt portobello but they were informed of the contrary by two vessels which were arrived from the honduras at the port of cales laden with six thousand chests of indigo and two hundred thousand piasters these brought word that some bucaniers commanded by an englishman had landed at the port de bastimentos and after five days march in the mountains had attackued portobello that the the spanish garrison threw away their arms and retired without fighting a stroke into the citadel that a poor negro who was seventy years old had marched out of it followed by twenty five soldiers and made a brave resistance but was killed upon the place being abandoned by his men the bucaniers carried away thirty six thousand crowns and all the booty they were able to take with them in fine having passed the gulf of darien and being conducted by the indians that were enemies to the spaniards they arrived through unknown ways in nine days to the south sea within a league of panama they embarked in this place in some canoos and passed by port de perico where they made themselves masters of three vessels and several barks they went from thence to pillage the suburbs of panama the garrison of which place without making any resistance retired to a bastion with the president and the auditors of the exchequer the bucaniers continned some days masters of the sea but at last departed upon information that a relief of four hundred men was coming from cartagena and that two vessels were setting sail from lima to oppose their designs the council of the indies highly provoked against the spanish soldiers who had showed so little courage upon this occasion assembled at madrid and resolved to send three hundred veterane soldiers to reinforce the garrisons they gave full authority to don melchior navarra who was named to go viceroy for peru to condemn without appeal the officers and other soldiers that were found guilty and to decimate them in case he found them all in fault as it was believed here  it was no small mortification to them to hear of the taking of a vessel belonging to the king of spain the lading whereof was computed to be worth four hundred thousand crowns in goods six ships of the elector of brandenburg took her near ostend this prince was highly enraged at the ill treatment of his envoy and it seems the menaces he gave them just as he left madrid were not without effect twas believed here that he had done himself too much justice but others who considered this action without prejudice were agreed that it was but natural for the elector of brandenburg to make recourse to violence after the unfair measures they had kept with him which he had so much the less reason to expect because he was devoted to the interests of the house of austria and had chiefly supported it in the last war but if these reasons served to excuse him there were others that laid some blemish upon him to use such an action of hostility toward a king with whom he was in peace and who had never failed on his side to satisfy him unless he had been utterly incapable of paying him that at the very time when the envoy from brandenburg demanded the money the king of spain had not enough to defray the expenses of his household and that if he had been in other circumstances he had dealt better by him  the court was not a little troubled at this infraction of the peace and now they had a fresh argument to grieve them they were informed that the portugueses pretended to keep the island of st gabriel to themselves and that although buenosaires lay so near it yet they were in a condition to maintain themselves there the coast of brasil lying so near favored them as well as the river whose channel is so very narrow in that place that it was an easy matter to command it and to hinder all commerce the portugueses it seems had entered the the river de plata and all these circumstances were the more affiicting because it was certainly known that a squadron of brandenburghers was gone for the indies this affair was talked of and the council met about it but those that were well acquainted with the genius of the spanish nation were satisfied that the alarm would not last very long because at court they look upon dangers that are at any distance but as so many things that will never happen  the king and queen being come back to madrid from the escurial every one was very forward to make his court to them and on the fourth of november which was the festival of st charles his majesty went to the chapel in the palace where the ambassadors  crowned heads appeared to compliment him and several of the grandees of spain who kissed his hand according to the custom the king was dressed in a suit the groundstuf whereof was black with flowers of gold embroidered with pearls and a large diamond in the midst of every flower his chain to which the order of the fleece was fastened glittered with several emeralds half a finger long the queen mother writ to the queen in the morning desiring her to dress her self that day after the french fashion the queen carried this billet to the king and after she had read it to him asked him if he would agree to it he told her she looked so pretty in her spanish drss that he prayed her not to quit that habit on a day of rejoicing  the king took away the receipt and aministration of the revenues of of madrid from the corregidors and regidors when he knew their cheats and villainies he entrusted the management of them to a council composed of four persons don lopez de los rios don andrea villaran don francisco carrillo and don joseph benavidez and empowred them to make the regidors give them an account of their administration they were accused to have gotten the sum of eight hundred thousand crowns by the expenses of the queens entry and by the building of the new bridge at toledo which was carried away by the waters of the mancanares at the same time the collecting of the imposts upon wine victuals and coals was taken away from them these alterations diminished the profits of their offices so mightily that they could scarce get any people to bid six thousand ducats for them whereas before this reformation it was an usual thing to give ninety thousand although the salaries were not above six hundred ducats  the chief minister had sent a commissioner some months before to the frontiers of biscay to adjust the rights of both sides with the french but he being fond of his commission endeavored to prolong it and so decided none of the differences there were some regiments at bayonne posted all along the river of bidassoa and some brigandines blocked up the mouth of it to hinder the inhabitants of fontarabia from all manner of traffic they could not go out to fish or commit any of those acts of hostility to which they had been so long accustomed and now they were given to understand that they should be kept thus imprisoned till the court of spain had consented to a reasonable accommodation whilst matters continued in this posture the brigandines pretended to go away immediately the biscayners began to fish but the french coming back upon them carried them away prisoners and made themselves masters of their barks as soon as this news was brought to madrid the ministers began to exclaim that this was an unheard of violence and such an infraction of the peace as was never to be endured but his most christian majesty ordered his ambassador to acquaint them that they then ought to remove the difficulties which occasioned so many disorders or till they were regulated to consent to follow the decisions which the commissioners of france had made after the treaty of peace  a person of the first quality who had followed the king to the escurial and came back from thence before him told us that he had strong conjectures to believe that the duke de medina celi had fallen out with the queen mother however few persons suspected it at that time but after the return of the court to madrid it was plain and visible some people pretend that the duke was wearied with the great number of creatures whom the queen mother daily recommended to him and to whom he was forced to distribute part of his favors that now he did not look upon her as any longer necessary to support his fortune and therefore was not willing to grant the frequent demands she made him that in order to break off with her all at once he found it convenient to visit her no more but express a great coldness toward her on the contrary there were other persons that said that it was occasioned by the queen mother her self who was not able to constrain her self so far as to suffer the presence of a man who minded nothing but how to advance his family or friends and never showed any civilities to her there were others still that were of opinion that the dukes behavior toward the queen mother was not the result of his own inclinations but proceeded from the suggestions of don geronimo deguya and indeed it might be so if it were not for the two following reasons the first is because there was not the least appearance of any particular motive to engage him to desire a rupture between the queen mother and the duke the other is that supposing he had such a design ye deguya did not at that time stand so firm  the kings good graces as that the chief mnister should think it worth his while to giv him so great a proof of his deference n it is certain that they had a picque against  another for some time the subtle insinuati humor of de eguya made him always embrace the interests of the most fortunate and he found himself under certain circumstances which advised him not to press too far for fear of disobliging the chief minister but notwithstanding the coldness which passed between them the king when he was at the escurial told deguya one day very angrily that if he was not more punctual for the future to come and help him in the dispatches he would do all the business with vibanco who was secretary to the chamber and for whom the king showed inclination enough  the duke immediately whether out of generosity or politic excused de eguya so handsomely that he set him right in the kings favor again and this obligation for which de eguya was indebted to him made them be in a good understanding with one another  de eguya finding himself so well with the duke confirmed him in all the dispositions he already had not only in regard to the queen mother but also to the young queen  he represented to him that these two princesses could do nothing for him that the king would take it well to find him testify a devotion only to his own person and that he would answer him with his affection better when he saw it was not divided his true design in speaking to him after this manner was only to keep him to himself that so the chief minister might repose an entire confidence in him  in fine they were both agreed that in order to render the duke an absolute master it would be necessary for him to resolve to refuse the two queens whatever offices or employments they begged for their creatures the duke imagined that this counsel proceeded from a true motive of zeal which he thought abounded in de euguya and believed him so heartily that he would do nothing but by his advice the duke was generally complained of for suffering himself to be managed like a child by the only man of spain who as he was a person of the greatest courtship so he was likewise of the least sincerity  to pursue the project of disgusting the queen mother the chief minister ordered pensions to be given to several persons who were directly opposite to her the duke de villa hermosa who had got enough in flanders and the duke of alva were in this number the marquess de astorgas was made master of the ordnance although he was comptroller of the queens household and that single place with the wealth he had heaped up in the kingdom of naples might very well suffice a man of his age the chief minister afterward assigned pensions to the women of the duchess de medina celi out of the bolsillo which is a sort of a privy purse for the kings house and other private expenses he gratified several of his own domestics after the same manner whilst those belonging to the king lay under such great necessities that they found themselves obliged to quit his service for mere want and poverty  the duke de medina celi gave one proof of his power which succeeded a great deal better than one could have have believed on the    th of november he married one of his relations whose name was don augustine henriquez de gusman a cadet of the house of gusman very poor and of little or no merit to donna aura only daughter to the duke de montalte who was but fifteen years old and so rich that she was looked upon to be the best match in all spain as well upon the account of her fathers vast estate as those of the marquess de los velez and the count de oropeza whose fortunes she was to inherit in case they had no children this affair was the work of the duchess de medina celi don augustine de gasman had waited upon her with so much assiduity that to recompense his services she procured this marriage for him all the world was extremely surprised at it but no body could comprehend upon what considerations the duke de montalte consented to sacrifice his daughter to policy the marquess de los velez the count de oropeza and all the rest of their family were hereupon mightily enraged at the duke de medina celi they quitted his interests which they had hitherto embraced with zeal and they openly declared that they would resent so dishonorable an alliance as long as they lived the count de oropeza made particular complaints against the duke because he had contributed more than any one to his elevation and that if he had been minded to have taken advantage of the favorable dispositions his majesty had to him it is certain that when don juan was dead he might have been made chief minister notwithstanding he was so young but as he had a great respect for the duke he imagined that if he vigorously assisted him upon so important an occasion he would always remember him for his services and that if he did not rule by himself he should at least govern by his friend in this he found both repose and security together he flattered himself with disposing of favors and being defended from the aversion of the people these reflections engaged him to employ all his wit and all his credit with the king to declare the duke his chief minister but for all this obligation which was transcendent and for which he was so much indebted to him he did not act fairly with relation to the daughter of the duke de montalte for although the count de oropeza was her uncle yet he knew nothing of her marriage the marchioness de los velez grandmother to this young lady was no better informed of it they were married privately without any ceremony for fear lest any one should come to disturb the feast  the king and queen being willing to divert themselves went to prado to hunt there till st andrews day they came back from thence by reason the queen mother had a slight indisposition upon her and they were desirous to visit her every day  about this time don philip vinzani an able chemist who came from naples to madrid with don pedro de arragon received orders from the chief minister to examine the money which had been cried down some months before in order to separate the silver from the brass it was pretended that the king by this means would get six millions of pieces of eight and that he would employ them to send considerable forces to sea for the pope was willing that the money which was to be collected by the bulls of the crasade should be laid out to equip a fleet to make war against the corsairs of barbary at the same time they were apprehensive that the vessels sent to the indies had suffered shipwreck because they had received advice that one of them arrived very much shattered at barbados and they could not hear any news of the rest although it is the custom of spain for the king to dine with the knights of the goldenfleece on st andrews day his majesty dispensed with it to take the diversion of hunting as he came back from prado toward the evening the two queens went out to meet him and conducted him to the admiral of castiles house where they had passed the time ever since noon this nobleman who was always generous and magnificent being informed that he was to receive this honor ordered the basins of several fountains to be encompassed with large silverpots filled with all manner of victuals flowers and fruits as the season produced and the diversity joined to the order had a very agreeable effect upon the eye in all the summerhouses which terminated the walks there were little tables set out with pieces of crystal agate cornelian and tapistry of gold and vermilion having all sorts of things in basins after the same manner as the tables had he got all sorts of fruit counterfeited particularly of grapes which hung with their leaves and branches in the grottas they were composed chiefly of little carbuncles of a pomegranate color topazes and amethysts and nothing could look finer or prettier the two queens received a mighty satisfaction at this walk as soon as the king was arrived they went into the house where fifteen ladies and as many cavaliers immediately appeared dressed after the fashion of the country the ladies came at first in their mantles tabados that is to say all their face was covered except one eye the cavaliers for their part wore their cloaks up to their noses and their hats over their eyes this was a sort of masquerade and to divert their majestys they talked with their fingers and by signs for some time with all the several turns and gestures that are used in this kind of dumb conversation afterward the ladies quitted their mantles and the lords their cloaks and began to dance a saraband after the moorish fashion holding one another with taffataskarfs of different colors and quitting them sometimes to carry flambeaus in their hands the women wore little caps on their heads covered with plumes that were raised upon the fides very high when the saraband was finished the ladies kissed the queens hand and the cavaliers the kings their majestys were pleased to declare that they were extremely satisfied with this pretty entertainment the duke de medina celi and the constable of castile knowing what honor the king had done the admiral desired him that he would condescend to come and divert himself at their houses whither he went along with the two queens there were comedies there and artificial fireworks and a noble collation they omitted nothing that might testify their joy upon this occasion and their acknowledgment of so great a favor  on the second of december the king demanded a supply of money of all the councils and a hundred thousand pieces of eight of the council of italy he proposed to sell some places to raise this sum because it was impossible to be raised any other way  the king being informed that abundance of people died of several distempers at port st mary which were chiefly occasioned by the great scarcity of provisions told the duke de medina celi that some way or other must be found out to remedy these miseries and that he could not endure to hear any more talk of them that they had been of a long standing which made him inclined to believe that all this proceeded from mere negligence the duke replied that he would not lose one moment to redress them and that if his life would do the people any good he was free to sacrifice it he went home very melancholy and having retired into his closet with his duchess i have a great desire says he to her to abondon every thing i slave and kill my self here with business and after all meet with nothing but reproaches for my pains when you have once brought things into a good condition says she you may quit them if you please but if you leave them at present all the world will conclude that it is through weakness she added so many reasons to these that she made him take courage again although he was mightily dejected the marquess de priego his soninlaw being come to madrid to see him as he entered the room hit himself a little blow on the temples against the edge of a cabinet he was immediately seized with a bleeding at the nose and died of it in a short time after  our ambassador prevailed with the king to give his consent to appoint a judge conservator whose only business should be to look after all affairs relating to the french nation  the business was decided at last at madrid in favor of constable colonna upon the difference he had with the roman knights subjects to the king of spain about the priority they pretended to dispute with him in the cavalcade which is every year performed to present the the pope with a white mare and a common schedule for the kingdom of naples which the king of spain holds in fief of the holy see his catholic majestys council had delayed to regulate this affair ever since the year      when the roman barons perceived that it was not determined in favor of them they searched new occasions to get the sentence revoked and to succeed in their designs they united themselves with the heads of the papal families to write all of them together to madrid about the matter when the king was told of it he only answered what is judged is judged the marquess de liche ambassador from spain at rome fell sick he sent immediately for the popes physician to come to him and when his friends demanded of him why he chose him before his own i am so weary of my life says he that i purposely send for one who will soonest kill me if it were only to please his master the pope being informed of this answer sent one of the gentlemen of his chamber to visit him and ordered him to tell the marquess that he desired his health as much as he did his absence and by that judge whether he wished his recovery or no  about the beginning of december there was a great earthquake in the province of salerne as also at naples and the places about it nevertheless it did no damage it was commonly said at madrid that the queen mother had engaged the king to nominate cardinal nitard to be viceroy of naples and that she hoped in a short time to see her two favorites with her the cardinal was the first and the marquess de valenzuela the second the marquess de los velez who had no desire to quit his place sent the king in order to fix himself in his good graces a stately coach of admirable sculpture and embroidered all over most delicately but although the king had so many fine coaches by him i never saw him in any of them he just cast his eyes upon them and then they were shut up in a coach house where time and the dust absolutely spoiled them the king rather loves to ride in great coaches of green linen waxed over made after the same fashion with ours and which a simple citizen of paris would not vouchsafe to go in the marquess de los velez sent him likewise some neapolitan horses but so finely shaped that nothing certainly ever came near them  few days passed wherein the king and queen did not go a hunting or else to see a play they went to buen retiro to behold some dutchmen skate upon the ice after the fashion of their country some ladies sent to acquaint the queen that if her majesty would permit them to appear masked because they had no mind to be known they would show her better sport than she had hitherto seen they were told that they might come if they pleased and immediately they went upon the ice in short petticoats fine shoes and stockings and pattins after the dutch manner they danced a saraband with castanets to admiration moving as nimbly as the dance would allow them but the ice not being equally thick in all places broke under one of them and let her fall into the water where she had certainly been drowned if people had not come to her help immediately having lost her mask by this mischance they saw she was a very deformed old woman who was near threescore years old when the queen was told of it she smiled and answered that at that age it was lawful for any one to go masked  the two queens on st nicholass day made a present of precious stones to the duchess dalbuquerque because it was her birthday she offered them in way of return some curiosities of great value and particularly a prayer book to the young queen which was incomparably well painted with golden clasps and adorned with diamonds it being now toward the end of the year i went according to custom to wish her majesty a happy new year she was dressed in a slight stuff of white wool and had a prodigious quantity of large pearls about her she sat near a great vessel full of olive stones and turning over the the leaves of the prayer book which the duchess dalbuquerque had given her did me the honor to show it me see says she here are henry the fourth and mary de medicis on their knees stretching out their arms in their oratory it is certain that this book was made for one of them i was desirous to know by what accident it came into spain and told her that perhaps queen elizabeth brought it thither upon this she called for the duchess dalbuquerque and asked her how she came by it the duchess told her she could not tell but only that she had received it of her mother the queen said to me afterward are you not surprised to find me dressed in white woollen it is a small sort of devotion which the king and i perform but no body shall know the reason of it ah madam replied the duchess de pastrane we all of us take the liberty to divine how says the queen without mistaking no i am not positive says the duchess and for you said she to me have you guessed at the true cause yes madam very easily replied i and all spain joins its vows with yours dont you know says the queen smiling that this is none of the best places in the world to play the sorceress in and that we have a horrible inquisition here the king entered the room at that moment so the queen rising up told him with a cheerful air that she had two sorceresses to show him and that the duchess de pastrane and i had divined the mystery of her white habit the king although in all appearance he seemed to be in a good humor he looked so angrily upon us and particularly upon my self whom he knew to be a frenchwoman that i made a profound reverence and went immediately out of the queens apartment  an order was here published to raise the price of money which was reduced to a fourth part of its value  although the duke de medina celi was indisposed yet he did not neglect to inform himself diligently of every thing that happened and he was not a little troubled to hear that the plague began to rage again at port st mary the scarcity and poverty of this country was so extremely great that several persons died daily for want and the duke de medina cidonia was obliged to send corn from andaluzia thither the misery was not less at naples the popes nuncio by his holinesss order summoned the superiors of all the regular houses hither to oblige them to give the city some relief in corn  they granted two in an hundred of their revenue and it was hoped that what with this money and what with the charities they drew from private persons they would remedy these pressing necessities but after some time cardinal caracchioli archbishop of naples acquainted the marquess de les velez by his vicar general that the pope would not suffer the tax of two in the hundred to be raised any longer upon the ecclesiastical revenues thus the viceroy found himself disapponited in his designs of raising two hundred thousand crowns which were to be laid out in corn and likewise a more considerable sum that was to be sent to madrid to augment the disorder which was already great enough the price of goldmoney diminished daily in the duchy of bari which totally hindered all commerce in the greatest part of the kingdom on the    th of december they made a procession at naples which is duly performed every year to thank god for preserving this city from the flames of the mountain vesuvius the body and blood of st januarius one of the protectors of naples was carried about in this procession  the king was troubled with an ague for a few days toward the beginning of january      it is impossible for any one to show the assiduity that the young queen made appear during the little time his indisposition lasted two comedies were acted at court to divert his majesty after his recovery on one of these days the king having prohibited all persons without exception to sit upon the theater the duke dossone placed himself there upon a heap of cushions and would not depart the king took no notice of it during the play but as soon as it was over he sent an order to him to come no more to council or to court he was not in the least pitied since he had voluntarily drawn this misfortune upon himself and because it was necessary to mortify him a little but what principally occasioned the kings severity is that he had observed in his journey to the escurial that the duke who was master of the horse to the queen did not follow the court thither a little after his return he sent him word that he expected him to wait more diligently for the future the duke took no notice of this advice and as he was one of the haughtiest men in the world affected a certain negligence in the discharge of his office which obliged the king to acquaint him by a note from the secretary of state that if he did not behave himself better for the time to come he would dispose of his place to some body else he might easily have judged from this that the king had his eye fixed upon him and at least ought to have taken care of himself for some time but his natural haughtiness would not suffer him to comply with this constraint  the duke de medina celi did not pass all his moments with content he was envied for the high post he enjoyed and deguya was mortally hated both of them had powerful enemies and amongst these were reckoned the duke de pastrane and his two brothers the admiral of castile the prince de stillano the count de monterey the count doropeza and the marquess de mansera they frequently met together and made severe reflections upon the unequal conduct of the duke de medina celi they observed that he was too irresolute when there was an occasion for constancy too lazy when he ought to be diligent and too positive when he was justly and reasonably opposed they examined the present state of the kingdom the misery of the people and the little appearances there were that he would redress them they proposed expedients to remedy all these grievances and likewise to prevent those that might happen but as it was not the public good alone that made them thus inquisitive but their private interest animated them they took all of them different measures to attain the particular ends they proposed to themselves it is true indeed they all concurred in the destruction of the chief minister but when he was removed out of the way every one was desirous to make the best advantages for himself and thus this narrow spirit of selfinterest which was so predominant in their cabals hindered them from uniting with that sincerity that makes great affairs succeed happily  amongst these noblemen the admiral was most forward to desire an alteration he had not forgot the sweetness he had tasted in that short interval when the marquess de valenzuela was the queenmothers favorite the remembrance of that golden time made him desirous of another like it for though he was a person of a great estate yet his expenses were so extraordinary that if he had been a great deal richer he would have been always in debt he desired therefore to contribute what in him lay to the setting up of another minister in order to find his accounts in it not that he designed to heap up any money but to throw it out of the windows and squander it away if he could but get enough to serve so he carefully looked about him to find out a fit and capable person to be advanced to this honor and at last the count doropeza seemed to be the most proper to accomplish his designs for he did not doubt but that those particular marks of esteem his majesty always showed him would have their effect in case he were supported by a powerful party  on the other hand the count de monterey who wanted neither youth wit nor ambition whose whole deportment was agreeable and courtlike who had been concerned in the management of several affairs who was laborious and vigilant took only resolute and secret persons into his party he had the justest occasions in the world to be displeased with the duke de medina celi and don geronimo deguya his mortal enemy had done him a great deal of wrong before the king he had painted the action and character of this count in such black colors that the young queen designing to do him some good offices and speaking very advantageously of him to his majesty he told her that monterey might reckon himself happy enough that he wore his head upon his shoulders still the count was sensibly disgusted to see the duke de villa hermosa who had been governor of flanders after him and who had even served under his orders made counselor of state at his arrival at madrid and himself consequently excluded after so disobliging a manner besides this he saw that the marquess de liche his brother was detained at rome against his will although he daily petitioned to be called home this gave the count a new occasion to complain and made him sensible of the ill dispositions they had at court to his brother and himself the marchioness de liche who was beautiful and young threw her self frequently at the kings feet to demand of him the return of her husband who was continually indisposed at rome whether it were because the air did not agree with him or that his uneasiness to be kept there by force contributed to destroy his health what makes the case harder is that she did not request to have him come back to madrid but only that he might have permission to live in any of his majestys dominions the greater part of the counselors of state were agreed in favor of the marchioness and her entreaties had certainly met with success if the enemies of the marquess de liche had not taken all opportunities to confirm the king in the opinion he had already of him that he was a man of the most incureable ill temper in the world and that it was not possible for him to permit him to come home without hazarding the peace of all the court we may therefore easily apprehend that the count de monterey had reason enough to be angry with the duke de medina celi and deguya and his resentments as well as his ambition made him passionately wish to see another in the place that he might effectually revenge himself upon the duke whom he hated and might have access enough to the new favorite to be able through his means to be introduced into the council of state and push on his own fortune he imagined himself capable of doing it by his merits and good management but although he might with justice aspire to the most high and difficult posts he was obliged to conceal his desires and intentions because he found peoples eyes were still upon him and that several who made a solemn profession to be his friends served only as so many spies to watch him this consideration prevailed with him to put that restraint upon himself as to live in a sort of retirement and that with so much circumspection as to discover his designs almost to no body nay he affected to visit the duke de medina celi and having found him one day more easy of access than was usual with him he freely declared to him that it was not without the greatest impatience that he beheld the preference the duke de villa hermosa met with to be made privycounsellor and himself excluded the duke answered him that he might expect his turn one day and upon this showed him some civility which persuaded the count to believe that he had now perhaps a greater kindness for him than formerly this reason engaged him to make his court regularly to him and to devote himself to him at least in appearance  the duke de veraguas sensible of the affront he had received in losing the viceroyship of valencia had no other motive to induce him to think of the removal of the chief minister but only an expectation that he who succeeded him in that place would do him more justice than the duke de medina celi had done for although the duke de veraguas was descended of an illustrious family as being of the house of portugal and that besides his youth he had a great deal of merit and capacity yet whatever importunities he made at court to be restored to his viceroyship again he was not able to obtain it he had received absolution privately from the apostolic nuncio for having ordered the monk to be executed who had quitted his habit and was made captain of the banditti it was believed that having now appeased the pope this would facilitate his reestablishment he daily presented his petitions to the council he demanded of them that if he were a criminal they would treat him as such that his trial might come one and that his head might answer for the faults he had committed but that if after strict examination of his conduct they found he had served his majesty well they would not deny him the justice that is allowed to the meanest soldier his trouble and his requests were always equally unsuccessful he found them perverse and prejudiced against him and so by this ill usage they obliged him to join with the male contents  as for the duke de pastrane he had not in the least been ill used at court however he thought it sufficient ill treatment to be left without an employ his wife who was sister to the marquess de liche and the count de montery being provoked at what indignities those of her family had suffered persuaded him to use all his efforts to get a new ministry established the duke de pastrane voluntarily espoused this party and his two brothers whom he had made acquainted with the design were resolved not to separate their interests from his one of them was named don gasper the other don joseph de sylva the last of these had a very great share in the kings affections and his place of chief gentleman usher procured him a great esteem and approbation he had married the daughter of the marquess de mansera but these three noblemen were guilty of a great solecism in this affair for they communicated the matter to don sebastian bibanco secretary of the chamber out of a presumption that he was of the same opinion with themselves but herein they were mistaken for he was infinitely more devoted to the chief minister than to them and consequently no sooner knew any thing of importance but he immediately discovered it to him  the marquess de mansera grand master of the queenmothers household and her creature desired for her sake as well as his own to see the government molded into another form he was a man well advanced in years whose merit and experience might with justice prompt him to believe that he was fit to possess whatever place they would assign him in the ministry he desired a juncto to be erected that he might be chosen a member of it but knowing that his zeal for the queen mother rendered him strongly suspected and that he ran an extraordinary hazard if he appeared for himself he judged it expedient to employ the marquess de grana who was his brotherin law and confident so he discoursed him about the matter and possessed him with a desire to take all necessary measures to effect it the other having nothing to fear by reason of his quality of being ambassador labored very diligently in the affair while the marquess de mansera expressed but a small concern for whatever happened at court unless it were for the marquess de granas endeavors to contribute to his advancement he seemed to be of opinion that for the interests of the emperor his master he was obliged to procure the prosperity of spain which languished under an extreme misery that extended it self farther than the limits of that kingdom that it was impossible for the king to second the emperor in any of his designs as long as the members of that great body were declining and continued under the ill effects of a consumption that made them utterly incapable of action that it was to no purpose to make any proposals to the ministers because whatever they promised him was never executed all these motives joined together excited him to make all possible advances to convince the duke of the necessity he lay under to erect a juncto  besides this he considered that the marquess de mansera would not fail of making one of that number that he would manage himself in the council according to the directions he gave him and that this would be the easiest way for him to succeed in all his enterprises he imagined that the best policy he could use to accomplish these designs would be to use none it all and so he addressed himself immediately to the duke de medina celi he began with commending his zeal his industry and pains and afterward passing into a more strict examination of every thing he was desirous to make him comprehend that the affairs of this monarchy were reduced to their last period unless he took sure and ready methods to remedy them that he made a slave of himself in vain since it was not possible for one single man to sustain like another atlas the weight of so many kingdoms that don louis de haro at a conjuncture of less difficulty had composed a juncto for his own ease and herein followed the example of several great ministers who preceded him that a juncto would serve to determine matters under the authority of the chief minister to whom they would carry every thing almost digested in his hand and that by this means business would go on cheerfully and speedily that at the present time whatever good resolutions were taken yet they continued without effect by reason of the general perplexity which rendered those things difficult that appeared to be very easy that he ought to consider that the most accomplished genius in the world without great presumption could never promise himself to move so ponderous a machine all alone and that be therefore counseled him to take some seconds of experience and ability sufficient to make him repose one part of his affairs upon them  the chief minister relished these reasons of the marquess de grana promising to weigh the matter with deliberation and afterward if he saw good to determine himself by the advice he had given him this gave the ambassador good hopes that his visit would meet with happy success and as he was a person of a great deal of wit who knew how to set off any thing to the best advantage and show it by the best lights so he did not question but the duke de medina celi would lay hold of the expedient he had discovered to him but the chief minister had the weakness to discourse deguya about them who did not lose one moment to dissuade him from this resolution he represented to him that if he composed a juncto he went to give himself so many tutors that then he could decide nothing but in concert with them that he would find himself joined with noblemen who were led by their own passions blinded with their own interests still pursuing their own ends and turning every matter to their own private advantage that notwithstanding all this he only must resolve to bear the brunt of all and that every body having their eyes fixed upon him would pursue all his motions step by step that if any difficult juncture any misfortune or unexpected accident should happen he alone must incur the reproach of it that the juncto would never be called in question for ill events but that they would all lie at the chief ministers door that it was very just and natural to think that if he alone was responsible for all miscarriages that then he alone deserved to enjoy the grandeur and advantages that are annexed to this place he turned the dukes inclinations so happily by these reasons that he resolved to follow them notwithstanding the advice that was given him to the contrary so that when the marquess came to him with expectations to find him continue still in the same sentiments and ready to put them in execution he perceived that he was steadfast and inflexible in the other opinion and that all the avenues to him were shut up and hindered  in the mean time the lords who had associated together to make a league against the duke continued to assemble in private and to debate of the expedients that were to be taken to convince the king of the necessity there was to choose another minister or at least to erect a juncto but the greatest part of their time was generally spent in making long politic discourses and these same politics hindered them so that none of them offered to put himself at the head of the party when the question was about setting up a chief every one stood looking upon his neighbor they wanted that amity and confidence in one another which is necessary to cement these designs and he that merited the greatest esteem was sure to find the least friendship from the rest envy reigned amongst them sincerity was not observed and when their society was examined there was nothing but vanity and weakness to be found at the bottom  amongst those who were most sensible of the ill management that was to be found in this cabal the admiral of castile was one of the first he easily discovered all the defects of the party and found it was nonsense to be longer engaged in it since the bow was not drawn high enough to send the arrow to the butt he was assured that the design would be discovered and that then he should find himself very finely ruined that supposing it succeeded and a juncto was set up the marquess de liche would in all probability be made a member of it and for his part rather than that should happen he would choose to go to hell because he bore such an implacable hatred to him this only idea that now he contributed to procure an advantage for the marquess turned his inclinations absolutely from the society into which he was entered in fine after abundance of reflections he totally abandoned it and several people were strongly persuaded that he was not content to quit it but that he went to the king and acquainted him with the most minute particulars of what had passed there nay that he gave the same advice to the duke de medina celi  the first victm the duke sacrificed to his resentments was the count de montery whether it were because his indignation were the more violent against him by reason of the friendship he always pretended to him and now had violated or because he feared him more than any of the rest so that notwithstanding the great security he imagined himself to be in for his circumspect conduct the president of castile sent him word that he had something to say to him and therefore must see him that evening at court for it must be observed by the way that the presidents of castile never go to make any visits the count was very glad to have this opportunity to discourse him having some affairs to speak with him about wherein he was concerned but his joy lasted but a short time for the president gave him an order contained in a billet from the king and signed by don geronimo deguya wherein it was specified that he must instantly retire to one of his countryhouses he continued surprised for some time and told the president he was ready to obey it but that being a grandee of spain he demanded an order signed by the kings own hand since it was the custom and that while he tarried for it he would go to put his affairs in order in short he returned to his own house extremely concerned and got his equipage made ready not at all doubting but that the order would be sent suddenly to him he received it next day which was the    th of january accompanied with a permission to tarry three days longer in madrid he passed them there amongst some of his friends and afterward parted for salamanca few people pitied his case because he was generally envied and when fortune leaves a man few of his friends have generosity enough to declare themselves in favor of him or to espouse his cause he was the first person whom the duke de medina celi treated ill and it is believed he had not made him serve as an example for the rest if deguya by his violent courses had not sowred that peaceable and sweet disposition that was so natural to the chief minister for he advised him to punish the count immediately to be a warning to others and he was banished rather because he was not agreeable to deguya and had too much merit than because he was an enemy to the duke the queen mother secretly rejoiced at it but could not so well conceal her satisfaction but that it was evidently perceived the count had quitted her party in don juans time and it is very well known that he had several pressing obligations upon him to have used her after another manner for if he had been willing to have made the best advantage of his fortune she had preferred him to valenzuela and entrusted him with the management of her affairs he had at least as many good qualities as the other could pretend to and was of an illustrious extraction but being a young man he neglected the advances the queen mother made toward him a certain person who knew the whole proceedings very well told me that father nitard was scarce gone out of spain when she began to cast her eyes upon him intending to honor him with her confidence on the festival of st isidore who is the patron of madrid and on which day a bullfeast was celebrated at the expense of the city the queen mother asked the count whether he designed to combat the bulls he told her no unless her majesty would be pleased to order him no says she i will by no means command you to do it but is there never a lady here in court who has laid any such commands upon you if any of them had replied he your majesty might well imagine that i would not fail to give her this mark of my obedience the queen cried out jesus jesus count will you expose your life thus a few days after this she let a paper drop out of her hands as he was giving her an account of some affairs she had entrusted him with he took it up and kneeling upon one knee presented it to her perhaps says the queen you believe it is a paper of importance come i will leave you to judge of that your self open it the count found the following words there  estoy toda la noche despierta sola triste y deseando mis penas son martirios mis martirios son gustos that is to say i pass all the night without sleeping alone pensive and forming desires to my self my pain is a martyrdom but my martyrdom is a pleasure the count read these words with so careless an air that the queen who observed it snatched the paper out of his hand and said to him go you insensible and say your domine non sum dignus the count was sensible of his fault and endeavored to repair it but it succeeded a great deal worse with him the queen mother did not doubt but that he had some other engagement which he preferred to his fortune she informed her self of his conduct and at last knew that he was desperately in love with the duchess de monteleon this was a young widow beautiful and agreeable but the queen prohibited her to come to court the duchess de terra nova her mother was extremely disgusted at it and this was the occasion why she disengaged her self from the interests of the queen mother and joined with don juans faction in the mean time the queen continued still enraged at the procedure of the count de monterey so that passing from the extremity of love to that of hatred she gave him during the remainder of her regency all the mortifications she could think of  most people were displeased with the admiral of castile and called him nothing but false brother and false friend nevertheless he would have it received for a certain truth that he never had any intention to make the least discoveries but that the king having sent for him told him that upon condition he would deal fairly and honestly by him he would forgive him whereas on the contrary if he went about to excuse himself he was certainly undone that he knew every thing that had passed even to the least circumstance that the declaration he demanded of him was rather to know his heart than to draw any new lights from him that when he would have denied every thing the king pressed him more earnestly than before so that upon that score he resolved to discover what related personally to himself but that he had avoided as much as was possible to speak of his friends to say the truth whether he really excused the prince de stillano or the court looked upon him to have made but an inconsiderable figure amongst the party the chief minister did not make him feel the effects of his indignation it is indeed as certain that his punishment preceded his fault and that having already lost his place of being president of the council of planders which was bestowed upon the count de monterey he had some justice on his side to expect that they would suffer him to live in quiet  the banishment of the count de monterey so terribly affrighted the duke de pastrane his brotherinlaw that he thought of nothing else but how to get handsomely out of the intrigue he followed the admirals steps that is to say he readily discovered whatever he knew of this affair that he might better persuade the king of his sincerity and repentance secretary vibanco to whom he opened himself had already discovered the whole contrivance but in fine he came soon enough to be favorably received his two brothers who were concerned in the same cabal imitated his example in reconciling themselves to the duke de medina celi and they seemed in all appearance to embrace his interests with greater zeal than any of his best and oldest friends nevertheless the duke de pastrane and his two brothers could not forbear to be a little troubled for being looked upon by the world as timorous persons who had only made these discoveries out of weakness and irresolution this reason obliged them to use all imaginable means to make it be believed that they had told the king nothing but that having had the misfortune to communicate their designs to vibanco he had sacrificed his friendship to make his court at their expense that the king had him ready to produce as a witness against them that he had severely threatened them and affixed their pardon only to their sincerity that they could not possibly avoid the doing of this at a juncture when they should otherwise have destroyed themselves without saving any body else and that if it had not been for these unhappy circumstances they had never been capable of doing this injury to their friends people hearkened to them but gave no credit to their words nay several of their friends reproached them very frankly for showing so little courage and constancy upon this occasion  perhaps the duke de veraguas had escaped as well as the prince de stillano and the loss of his viceroyship had prevented the punishment they pretended he deserved for joining himself to a party against the chief minister but he was impatient to be restored to his former dignity and continually demanded justice at their hands he filled all his petitions with complaints and loudly vented them against the duke de medina celi besides this he earnestly importuned the king to assign him some judges before whom he might justify his conduct in condemning the relapsed monk who had betaken himself to the banditti so at last he was sent to the council of arragon where he demanded to be re established as a piece of justice that could not be denied him and pursued this affair with all possible vigor and heat but on the third of february he received an order to withdraw presently to his estate in andaluzia he begged leave to go to any other place because the plague raged violently in that province but it was refused him and he had only eight hours to prepare for his departure one may say it was only the ill fortune of the duke de veraguas that procured him all the ill usage he met upon the account of his viceroyship for it is a certain truth that if there were a law to treat all people after the same manner who fail in their duty abundance of persons had been severely punished who were now gratified and encouraged for their pains but his majesty was so exceedingly prejudiced against him that one evening when the queen was demanding of him whether it were true that the duke de veraguas was banished he answered yes and that all those should be treated in the same kind who talked impertinently this was sufficient to make the queen know how his inclinations stood and as she was very prudent she took care to change the discourse immediately  it was now sensibly perceived at court that the duke de medina celi and don geronimo deguya opposed the queen mother in every thing but the true occasion was not positively known one day when the marchioness de mortare came to visit us we spoke to her concerning it and as she was particularly informed of the whole matter and reposed a greater confidence in us than in the spaniards because we had no interests to take in this affair she acquainted us that some time before the king went to the escurial deguya going to find out the queen mother to show her a certain letter which the marquess de liche ambassador at rome had sent to the king when he was come into her closet looked for it in his letter bag to no purpose he then remembered himself that he had locked it up in his scritore where he had several other papers which he had no mind any body should see and sent a little page for it who could not read the poor boy took the first letter he found there and wrapped it up in a sheet of white paper as he had every day seen his master do the same when he carried his expeditions to the king  don geronimo deguya tarried all this while with the queen mother and as soon as the boy brought him the letter without taking it out of the paper delivered it to her it was now toward evening and the queen went to the window to read it more conveniently she was immediately surprised to find it was not marquess de liches hand but that of donna lucinda bucados who was of the house de barcelona one of her maids of honor who was a very beautiful lady and extremely loved by deguya the letter was writ with a great deal of freedom and signified to him that he had no reason to apprehend that the queen her mistress would censure their amors she gave him several reasons for it that highly reflected on the queens reputation after she had read it over she imposed that constraint upon her self as to conceal her indignation for that time and only told deguya that she must discourse the king about what the ambassador had written to him as soon as he was gone she sent for donna lucinda and after she had reproached her for her ingratitude and impudence she caused her to be privately locked up in a little chamber well grated and barred up and kept the key of it her self here the unfortunate lucinda was forced to lie upon a sorry matt having nothing but bread and water to sustain her and the queen mother frequently ordered her to undergo the penance of a discipline they told those that enquired after her that she was sick of the smallpox that the queen had ordered her to be removed out of the palace and that she was dangerously ill  don geronimo deguya believed the news and was almost desperate for two days but having opened his scritore to take out something or other he was exceedingly surprised to find the marquess de liches letter there which he thought he had left in the hands of the queen mother he searched immediately for that of donna lucinda and not finding it he soon concluded where the fatal error was commitmitted so he ran in all haste to the queenmothers apartment cast himself at her feet conjured her to forgive lucinda to consider her youth her birth and the humble tender entreaties he made in her behalf but he found the queen inflexible seeing at last that he was not able to move her he told her he knew a way how to revenge himself upon her she asked him what it was he replied that he would hinder valenzuela from ever coming back again and that she should behold him no more the queen very much enraged at this answer told him that she was sensible enough of the ill will he bore her but that she did not fear the effects of it that it was a long time since she had lost valenzuela who was indeed one of the best servants she ever had but that she was now accustomed to bear his absence afterward she added these words looking earnestly upon him i would advise you for your own sake to hinder his return for if ever he comes to know that such a fellow as you had the boldness to displease me he would tear you in pieces as a lion does a shegoat  deguya possessed with rage took the first favorable opportunity to speak to the king in prejudice of valenzuela he represented to him that he was a bold intriguing man that if the queen had him with her they two would raise factions together in which they would engage all the turbulent spirits in the kingdom that by this means they would disturb the tranquillity he now enjoyed that the queen still regretted the time and authority of the regency that it was dangerous to show favors to any of those persons who had been her creatures of old in a word he so well managed the king upon this occasion that he bid him issue out an order such as he judged convenient to hinder the coming back of the unfortunate valenzuela deguya lost no time about it and the substance of the order was that if they met him upon the sea in his return to spain they should take him out of the vessel where he was and reembark him in that which brought the order and so carry him to cartagena in the west indies the queen mother for her part sent away donna lucinda in private with orders to ship her at the groyn and to transport her to flanders where she had sent word to prince alexander of parma to get her shut up in a nunnery but don geronimo deguya having found means to acquaint himself of what had happened dispatched an order of the chief minister to the groyne to bring donna lucinda back to one of her relations who had agreed to take care of her  the duke de medina celi espoused deguyas side in this dispute with a mighty heat the affair blew over at court without any noise or bustle as for the queen mother she spoke nothing at all of it because it had then been necessary to produce lucindas letter which was by no means convenient to be shown for the several fierce and disrespectful things contained in it on the other hand deguya had no temptation to speak of it for being secretary of state and under an obligation to preserve his spanish gravity he was not willing to discover his amorous weaknesses to the world  deguya who was the sole cause of the ill understanding between the queen mother and the duke de medina celi used all his endeavors to increase it still and in order to accomplish his designs alarmed the duke perpetually with all that he had reason to apprehend from the resentments and indignation of that princess what he whispered to him served to exasperate the chief minister more and more against her and this made him keep a fair correspondence with her no longer he considered with himself that he stood firm in the kings affection and that the father confessor and deguya who had more frequent occasions to discourse his majesty than he had would take care to confirm him in all the favorable dispositions he had for the duke this triumvirate began at the same time to sow the seeds of discord between the king and the queen mother no body durst acquaint the king with the reasons that inclined them to act so violently they had seen after what manner the chief minister had treated those persons who were not of his side and they had no mind to draw down his anger upon themselves the great officers belonging to the kings household seemed to depend entirely upon him the gentlemen of the chamber who waited every day in their turn paid no less abject submission to the favorite and those who had sincerity enough to speak considering the injury they might hereby do themselves left the province of better informing the king to some body else who had more zeal and less policy so that the duke de medina celi deguya and the confessor finding a clear field gave his majesty what ill impressions they pleased in relation to the queen mother they assured him that nothing in the world could make her forget the troubles and ill usage she had found when don juan governed all that although she had reason enough to believe that when that minister treated her so rudely he acted only by himself yet it was certainly true that all was done under the name and authority of the king that therefore she would always remember it was he that abetted the persecution she had suffered and that he ought to consider that it was by no means safe to repose any confidence in a reconciled enemy the natural goodness of the king and the respect he had for the queen his mother hindered him from being absolutely influenced by the pernicious counsels they gave him however they prevailed so far upon him as to render him jealous and consequently cold and reserved to her she easily perceived it and was well informed of all their designs but whether she judged it was by no means a proper time to endeavor the destruction of her enemies or whether she had some other reasons to dissuade her from attempting it she did not move at all in that affair and a short time after she never went out of her palace but only to make visits of common decency to the king and queen  the chief minister the father confessor and deguya applauded one another for having removed the queen mother from all share in the administration of affairs but fearing left the young queen might become serviceable to her in this conjecture they found it conveni ent to render the queen mother suspected to her they took a very odd way to effect it but one that served their turn as well as any that is to say they began to inspire the king with a dislike of the queens conduct wherein they made him observe abundance of inconsiderable slight things which they interpreted to him with so much the more malignity because the queen acting without any reserve as all persons of sincerity use to do never restrained her own natural temper  sometimes the king expressed to her some dissatisfaction at it and this afflicted her extremely but while she looked about her to find out who those persons were that did her these ill offices some of the dukes confidents gave her to understand that all this came from the queen mother who seeing she had no children endeavored to render the king indifferent to her that so she might arrive to what she so earnestly desired which was to see the archdutchess queen of spain the young queen found some appearances of truth in what they told her and this threw her into a dejection of mind that really made her an object of compassion another affliction was joined to this and contributed to augment her grief and that was to see the little credit she had to obtain whatever she desired  for although the chief minister had promised to be always devoted to her service and she had accepted of the duchess dalbuquerque chiefly upon his recommendation yet he seemed not at all to be sensible of it and never obliged her in any tolerable manner it was to no purpose that she begged any favor of the king and it was to as little purpose that his majesty granted them for he no sooner spoke to the duke about them but the duke dissuaded him from doing what the queen desired in such manner that if she requested any thing it was sufficient for her to rest assured that she should lose the fruit of her desires the queen who had a great deal of wit and penetration and who knew what obstacles the chief minister always laid in her way could not forbear to speak to the king about him in a most pressing earnest manner which intimated to him his unaccountable fondness for the chief minister and sometimes she closed the discouse with a particular detail of the disorders which were to be found in all affairs by reason of the dukes insufferable negligence the king gave deguya an account of what the queen told him deguya carried all to the duke to make his court by it and this still occasioned fresh complaints on one side and the other the young queen by this means completely lost that little interest she had in the chief minister and sometimes could not tell what measures she ought to take to strengthen and support her own authority  the queen was considering with her self what the occasion might be that made the duke de medina celi neglect to give her that deference he was obliged to pay her for so many reasons and the duke being informed that the queens resentments against him daily increased made use of the marquess dastorgass confessor to tell him who belonged to the queen that her majesty made a wrong judgment of his inclinations that he should always be ready to give her all imaginable testimonies of his respect and fidelity but tha it was an ungrateful displeasing sight to him to see her majesty show such particular favors to persons directly opposite to him amongst whom he reckoned the marchioness de liche the countess de monterey the princess de stillano the duchess de ossone the marchioness de los velez the duchess de linfantado and some others that if she would be pleased to remove those ladies or at least not entertain them with such evident distinctions of kindness he should receive it with a most sensible acknowledgment and omit no opportunity to give her all the proofs of gratitude he was capable of he added that without consulting his particular interests in this he was obliged to acquaint her majesty as being her servant that it was not the custom of spain for the ladies to have such free access into the queens apartment and that generally they were introduced by the camerara major only the queen listnd to this advice the chief minister sent her but had no inclinations to follow it because she found he designed to subject her entirely to the duchess dalbuquerque after the same manner as she had been to the duchess de terra nova  she knew that in all the differences he had with the queen mother the camerara major always declared for him that she embraced his interests with more zeal than her own and that she had clearly forgotten all that the queen mother had done for her to advance her to this place the queen had no desire to throw her self again into a captivity from which she had lately got her self delivered with so much difficulty thus she was content to examine the motives which made them set so many intreagues on foot but had no mind to be the victim  the duke had so pressing a desire to possess the sole affections of his master that he could never forgive those persons who were in a capacity to become his rivals and he added a certain air of sincerity to his words whenever he spoke ill of any one that the king was really persuaded he had no private byends in doing it his relations nay even his friends had no more privileges than others who were indifferent to him the duke was believed because he always passed for an honest gentleman but one ought to have a great fund of virtue not to be corrupted when he becomes a favorite he represented to the king all those that came near his person as so many secret enemies and domestic spies who had neither zeal nor affection for him and these impressions wrought so far upon the kings spirit that he was scarce ever able to wear them off the duke not only did ill offices to those that belonged to the kings household but he extended his malice to all those who were able to maintain any intelligence between the queen and the queen mother he was persuaded that the ambassador of france and his lady contributed to it all that lay in their power and this made him conceive an aversion for them both he spoke of them daily to the king after a very disobliging manner and laid several things to their charge wherein they were not concerned this made the king so mightily displeased with them that he could not forbear to tell the queen one day as they accidentaly talked of the marquess de villars that he had poisoned all the court and that he would rather choose to have an open war with france than such an ambassador at madrid he after this let fall some reflecting words against the ambassadors lady which sufficiently testified what strange thoughts he had of her although we may safely say that neither she nor her husband deserved it but the reason why the chief minister was so provoked against them was because he was well informed that the prince de stillano the count de monterey the duke de veraguas the admiral of castile and some others had seen him in private and communicated to him their designs against him to which he was to contribute something on his side by getting the queen to support the project but suppose the ambassador really knew of their intentions this is no good consequence that he was willing to second them and indeed there is little probability to believe it because the ambassador had no reason to desire the removal of the chief minister and the dukes abilities were not so formidable that the court of france had any occasion to be apprehensive of him  while the court at madrid was thus divided about the little intrigues i have mentioned the people continued to cry out and complain of their grievances because no care was taken to redress them it was now a full year since the duke de medina celi had been made chief minister and it was hoped that he would have taken all necessary measures in a matter so pressing and important as was the easing of the people but he so far forgot his duty that every thing went worse and worse still and indeed the least inconveniences sensibly improve in their malignity when they are neglected the lessening the value of the coppermoney had occasioned a great disorder it is true indeed it might have been managed to the public advantage but they took such wrong measures in the regulation that it became a most horrible oppression for the species of gold and silver being thus reduced to one half of its just value foreigners took such hold of this opportunity that they exported prodigious sums out of the kingdom besides this the price of segovia wool which is an excellent commodity and brings a mighty profit to those that deal in it rose in proportion to the abatement of the money so that no body would buy it unless they would sink the price and things being in this condition then at last came the crying down of the money and this totally completed and ratified their misery there was computed to be of it to the value of six millions of crowns the king did not at all take them off although he had promised by his edict to pay the full value of the metal to those who brought them into the offices appointed to receive them so all this money lay absolutely dead and it is no easy matter to express the loss which the bankers the merchants the kings farmers and almost every private man suffered by this decrying of it down foreigners were the only men that made advantage of this general misfortune of spain they bought this coppermoney that was mixed with a good allay of silver for very little and sent it to genoa to portugal and other places the council very well knew the prejudice the kingdom received by it and assembled several times to find out an expedient to put a stop to it there were some undertakers that offered to treat for all of it and separate the silver from the copper and as i said before don philip vinzam was made choice of in this affair but he had not been preferred before others if it had not been for the credit of don pedro de arragason this man owed him great sums of money and had been twice bankrupt and was just upon the point of breaking the third time so he was desirous to introduce him into some great business that he might by this means enrich himself and be in a capacity of paying his debts but this project did not succeed because so great a quantity of this money was already carried out of the kingdom and the separating of the allay was so difficult a matter  these losses were the cause that abundance of persons of great quality found themselves under a necessity of selling their plate and jewels it is true there is so much both of the one and the other at madrid that it cannot well fail in a long time what made several private men suffer the more was that the rents of the town hall which were reduced from eight to five in the hundred were not now paid at all because the corregidors and regidors who were concerned in the payment of it were such great villains that although the city was sufficiently harassed with customs taxes and heavy duties before these people had drained it as long as they pleased and that they had put some small inconsiderable matter of it into the kings coffers there was nothing more left out of so many imposts and yet they were not levied for the greatest part but under the pretense of satisfying the rents of the town hall  but how was it possible to put things as they now stood into a better order it was resolved that there should not be above four regidors there had been more than fifty and their places were worth sixty thousand crowns it is certain that before they could reimburse themselves of such a sum they must be guilty of great extortion and cheating  an order was sent from madrid to all the ports to publish reprisals in favor of the subjects of the king of spain upon the vessels belonging to the elector of brandenburgh i have already spoke of the vessel which that electors subjects had taken away from his catholic majesty the elector had allowed three months to redeem her but they were not in a condition to do it the ambassadors of england and holland labored to accommodate the business with no success because the elector declared he would be paid his eight hundred thousand crowns that were due to him and he would restore nothing but upon that condition and therefore the court would rather suffer him to enjoy his prize however to save the honor of spain the ministers pretended that the king would have his vessel restored before he would do any thing and that he refused to hearken to any other proposal till that were executed  the queen mother who seldom stirred abroad and who lived a very melancholy life at her palace invited the young queen one day to dinner when the king was gone out a hunting they afterward shut themselves up in the queenmothers great closet and as she told the marchioness de mortare from whom i afterward had the story they began to weep and embrace one another very tenderly the queen mother complained that the queen her daughterinlaw had prejudiced the king against her and that she suffered as great a confinement as if don juan did still govern that she was not ignorant that the duke de medina celi deguya and the confessor did her all the ill offices they were able that if she had only these to combat she would endeavor to destroy them that perhaps she might be able to accomplish it but that when she saw the queen at the head of the party she had no courage left to defend her self that although she very well knew she had promised to do her all the injury she could yet she could not forbear to speak to her of it rather to ease her self than out of any hopes to soften her dispositions alas madam alas cried the young queen all in tears why do you add such stabbing suspicions to the other ills you have done me could you not be conteat to poison my conduct before the king and make him show me a thousand sensible unkindnesses upon that score but must you insult upon me too and accuse me of the only thing in the world i am incapable of doing at these words the queen mother stretched out her arms to her and they tarried a considerable space of time without being able to speak a syllable so much were both their minds prepossessed against each other but at last when they could speak in cold blood and came to examine what had been said on both sides they were sensible that some ill persons had endeavored to disunite them in order to fortify their own party which was equally contrary to them both they gave one another an account of the measures that had been taken of the persons that were concerned in them of those whom they ought to suspect for the time to come and they resolved to employ all their interest to destroy the opposite cabal they stayed together till it was night and on the next day which was the fifth of february the constable of castile gave the king and the two queens a magnificent collation accompanied with music the kings dwarf who is one of the prettiest creatures in the world whom the constable brought with him from his government of flanders where he succeeded don juan danced a a ground passa cailla along with a young girl whom the queen had taken to her service and was newly redeemed out of slavery they were both of them dressed after the indian fashion covered with feathers of birds of different colors they had little tabors and played prettily upon them this feast was followed by another at the house of don pedro darragon where the queen danced before the king which she had never done before although she acquitted her self that way to admiration she had purposely learned the canaries and a saraband so that the king was perfectly charmed to see her so expert in the spanish dances and told her several times as he pressed her arms with his two hands mi reina mi reina eres la mas perfeta de todo el orb that is to say my queen my queen you are the most accomplished person in the whole world the queen mother sent her that evening a watch all adorned with diamonds and a goldchain of exquisite work she writ a letter to her wherein she wished that this watch would only show her happy and pleasant hours the queen returned her this answer that they would be always so if she would continue to love her she afterward desired the king to tell her some tender thing that she might send it to the queen mother the king told her immediately no tengo que desir how sir says the queen have you nothing to say to the queen your mother i beseech you to give me a compliment that may please her the king studied a long time what to send her and at last said ponga os mi reina que jo tongo busna salud that is to say write my queen that i am well  the king dispatched an order to prince alexander governor of the low countries to make a grand reform amongst the officers of war and justice he gave at the same time the viceroyship of navar to the great prior of castile the count de fuen salida who possessed that post went to gallicia whereof he was made viceroy the count de palma nephew to cardinal portocarero had the government of malaga and the coasts of granada in the room of the count de cifuentes and the duke de hijar soninlaw to the duchess de terranova obtained the viceroyship of arragon this duchess had not appeared at court ever since she had quitted it with so great a disgust but her soninlaw having now received this new favor she was resolved to go and visit the queen on the tenth of february she had already sent to her majesty to demand her permission and the queen sent her word that she should be glad to see her the duchess at her entrance into the queens chamber seemed at first a little disordered she excused her not coming to court upon the account of a long fit of sickness and then added i assure your majesty i did not think i should have been able to live after my misfortune to be separated from you the queen told her that she had been informed of her indisposition but that this was not a place for her to speak of what made her uneasy and in effect passed to some other discourse the duchess de terra nova fixed her eyes continually on the duchess dalbuquerque as if she had a mind to devour her and the duchess dalbuquerque whose eyes were neither better nor sweeter than hers looked askew upon her and they let fall every other moment some expressions that were a little eager  one of the footmen belonging to the venetian ambassador had committed some insolence and the justices ordered him to be apprehended for it but this minister pretending that it was against the privilege of ambassadors complained of it to the duke de medina celi but he did not receive so favorable an answer from him as he expected this so much disgusted him that he went to acquaint the rest of the ambassadors with it who all agreed to represent the consequences of such an action to the duke de medina celi in a large memorial conceived in very harsh terms which they sent to him all at the same time the chief minister carried it to the council of state who after they had maturely deliberated upon the affair were of advice that they should set the footman immediately at liberty the ambassadors were resolved in case they had refused them this satisfaction to have forced the prison to fetch him out  constable colonna came back to madrid in feburary the most important affair that brought him thither was his desire to accommodate matters with his lady and to find out a way for both of them to live in peace the marriage of his son with the daughter of the duke de medina celi did also take him up very much the queen was concerned at the misfortunes of his wife and it was no small trouble to her to understand what ill usage a person of her quality received in prison nay she was particularly obliged to protect her by reason of the promise the duke had made her and the confidence the constables lady reposed in it these reasons engaged her to charge her confessor to do all he could with the constable in order to negotiate an accommodation and see whether he would carry her into italy or suffer her to stay in some religious convent at madrid as she had already been but the constable and his wife were strangely exasperated against one another she resented to the life the unworthy treatment she had received and the mutual occasions they had to complain hindered them from consenting to what might contribute to their common satisfaction at last the constable being earnestly importuned by the queen and advised by the marquess de los balbazez proposed that his wife should turn a religious and that he for his part should take the habit of a knight of malta this at first appeared very surprising to all the world but indeed was more strange to the constables lady than to any one for it is certain she had no great desire to that life and her inclination did not very well relish three mortifying vows an austere cloystering and a severe rule nevertheless the constable was so positive that all his wives friends were satisfied there was no other way to deliver the unfortunate lady out of the castle of segovia but by obliging her to give her consent to what he proposed thus at last they prevailed upon her to consent to it so she was brought back to madrid on the    th of february      where she immediately was shut up amongst the nuns of the conception of the order of st jerome she was so afflicted at her misfortunes that she would see no body but her children she told them she looked upon her self to be the most unfortunate creature in the world and that she was going to do a thing which might cost her the repose of her life that she beheld the consequences of it with terror but that nevertheless she was resolved to undergo it because she had given her promise in effect she went down into the quire where every thing was prepared for the ceremony and she took upon her the habit of a novice but with a formal design to die rather than make profession she wore a petticoat of gold and silver brocard under her woollen robe and when she was not in company with any of the nuns she would throw her veil aside and put a coif upon her head after the spanish mode dressed with ribbons of all colors sometimes it so happened that the bell rung to chapel where she was obliged to make her appearance by the rule of her order and the mistress of the novices coming to inform her of it she clapped on her frock and veil over her ribbons and her loose hair this made a very odd and comical figure and no body could have forborne laughing at it had not her miseries on the other hand drawn the compassion of all persons that knew her for indeed her condition was very necessitous she wanted money had but mean eating and yet worse lodging one day as i happened to be in the queens retinue i entered the convent and the constables lady carried me to her chamber i was like to have been starved with the cold there it was as high as a tenniscourt and not to flatter the place it was no better than a great barn the constable got a dispensation from rome to hasten the time of her profession and he himself was obliged as i have already said to take the vows of the order of malta but he was told every day that his wife had an unconquerable aversion to become a religious and at last had no hopes of it the marquess de los balbazez as well as the marchioness were not a little concerned to be laughed at by all the world the constable concluded the marriage of his eldest son with the daughter of the duke de medina celi and parted three days after to return to rome he carried his sisterinlaw and his two sons along with him as for his lady she still tarried in the convent where she wore the habit of a religious long enough and at last quitted it  the king and queen went to the jesuits college to see a tragedy where a young scholar who personated a fury coming upon the theater with a lighted torch in his hand perceived his tutor in a corner who acted a chemist in all appearance he bore him a grudge for he ran after him and burnt his beard and hair and pursued him like a real fury indeed he played his part so well that the king was mightily pleased with him and would needs have them begin that scene again because it was the prettiest in the play the scholar desired it withal his heart but neither his tutor nor any of the college had a mind to be concerned in the other part the carnival approached and a comedy was played the three last days of it at court on the   th of february which was ash wednesday the king had a solemn service at the chapel royal and ordered the ambassadors to be told that he would continue to have one every week except holyday week  in the mean time the duke de medina celi applied himself seriously to find out means to set a fleet to sea by the spring and treated with some of the principal bankers of madrid whose names were dominico grillo francisco de monserato and ambrosio dionis the first engaged to send a hundred thousand piasters a month to flanders the second to remit fifty thousand to catalonia and the third thirty thousand to navar but what signified all these treaties since they were not in a condition to furnish necessary funds the court received advice from naples from whence they expected some supplies in money that the prince de belvedere and several of the principal barons were retired to their respective countryhouses by reason of the great disorders and misery of that city besides this they were informed that the inhabitants of trapan and of two other cities in that kingdom had made an insurrection killed their governor and judges and at the same time had sent to demand assistance of the turks this news found but an unwelcome reception at madrid  there arrived also at court a deputy of the commerce at sevil with whom i had a long conversation he assured me that that great and stately city was reduced to a condition which amazed all the world that there did not now remain one fourth part of its inhabitants that the imposts increased every day and that this city which but about fifty years ago was one of the richest in the universe was now ready to sink for want of relief although the gallions arrived there and it still enjoyed the most considerable trade of any place in spain we may hence justly conclude in what a sad condition the rest of the cities of spain were reduced to since the best of them was almost ruined this reason obliged me to enquire of a certai gentleman who was well acquainted in those   affairs what the revenues of the king of spai might amount to he told me that in read money only which came from the indies they amounted to thirty millions and eight hundred thousand ducats which in french money is worth somewhat more than seventy five millions of livers but then it ought to be observed that the king does not touch a third part of this sum the greatest part of it being either otherwise gaged or purloined and yet out of this third part are to be defrayed the expenses of the palace the pensions his majesty bestows and the payment of his armies he is likewise obliged to be still sending considerable sums to milan to naples to messina to catalonia and to flanders for the viceroys and governors take effectual care that the king shall not draw a farthing out of those kingdoms and provinces they keep all the profits to themselves and this is the reason why money is so often wanting even for the necessary occasions of the kings house but after all i can by no means be persuaded but that he is richer than he is generally supposed to be for there is no probability that otherwise he could be able to give as he does such considerable pensions and so much in standing wages to so vast a number of people it is true these liberalities so mightily incommoded him that about the beginning of the year      all the liverymen of the stables having waited two years together for their wages left the kings service on the same day and looked abroad to get a livelihood so that his horses had no body to look after them or give them corn this appeared so much the less surprising because the table of the gentlemen of his bedchamber was absolutely laid aside although it was the only one the king kept in his palace the women that waited upon the queen had no better luck and the court could not be supplied with money enough to defray the least expenses this extremity lasted for a while and then things were established as formerly but what is very remarkable and deserves the last commendation the soldiers notwithstanding this misery continued still in the service although there were several officers nay entire regiments of them that had not received two months pay in three years however this was the reason that abundance of garrisons were ill provided with men and in a very bad condition and particularly on the side of estra madura where nevertheless it was their interest to have been more careful because the portugueses had very considerable posts in that part of the country  we saw the governors of st sebastian bilboa and fontarabia at madrid who came on purpose to acquaint the council of war that their soldiers died of hunger that the youngest of them had deserted that none but the old and infirm were left behind in the garrisons and that in a short time there would be none of these left unless they gave them a speedy relief they had fair promises made them they returned back but were forgotten as well as a great number of others  it is indeed surprising and cannot easily be believed that in this very spain so excessively poor and exhausted as it seems to be the flota from the indies only in the year    0 brought thirty millions of gold but of these prodigious sums that arrive there every year we must deduct near two thirds which the foreigners draw away for the several goods they furnish them with and besides there is a way found to cheat the king of the fifth penney which is due to him out of all the silver that comes from the indies there is another thing still behind that contributes exceedingly to make the spaniards so destitute of money as they are and that is the prodigious number of french and dutch who come to help them whether in the tillage of the ground or in their buildings or any other things of a more servile nature which the don diegos and the don dodriguez think so much below them either out of a principle of vanity or idleness that they had rather choose to starve than resolve to set about them but foreigners are not so nice and delicate they come hither and when they have scraped a little money together they return to their own country in the mean time others come in their room and are employed in the same work they are computed generally to be full forty thousand who come in and go out of the kingdom after this manner and there is not one of them who does not carry away with him seven or eight pistoles every year and sometimes more it is easy to judge that this arises to a prodigious sum  the people still continued to cry out and exclaim and at last the duke fatigued with the great business he had upon his hands and with these continual complaints resolved to erect a juncto to set things in order again and endeavor to relieve the present necessities he cast his eyes upon a person of great abilities whose name was don lopez de los rios and whose virtue and experience were sufficiently known for he had always bore some office either in the civil government or the finances he had first showed a great zeal and the heat of this zeal did not at all abate in his mind but he found himself not strong enough to cope with all the enemies alone whom he must expect to create by a severe and steady conduct several persons nay even the ministers interested in these affairs directly thwarted him and by this means destroyed all that he had established with so much pains and industry  on the    d of february a private act of the inquisition was performed in the church of the dominicans where twenty persons were condemned for being guilty of superstition sorcery and judaism the duke de villa hermosa who came back from flanders arrived about this time at madrid and the duke dhijar parted from thence to go to saragossa and take possession of the viceroyship of arragon two days after this which was the    th of february the marquess de mondejar was made a grandee of spain  the duke dossone who now began to be weary of not supplying his place himself desired some of his friends to intercede with the king in his behalf that he mightcome to court and the king consented to it with this proviso that he should perform his duty better for the time to come the count de pouar and the count de montiel were forbidden the court both of them were passionately in love with donna francisca dalcannicas lady of honor to the queen and niece to the constable of castile the count de pouar was under her chamber window and entertained her there with his fingers as is the manner of spain and told her a story very much to the disadvantage of the count de montiel who lay hid in a corner where he saw and understood all so that coming toward the count de pouar all enraged with his hand upon the guard of his sword he told him he was a perfidious villain and that he might thank his good fortune for being in the palace the count de pouar coldly answered that he would go out of it as soon as he had told donna francisca two or three things he had still to say no her and that he came seasonably enough to be a witness of them because they concerned him the count de montiel transported with choler was upon the point of drawing his sword upon his rival but the duke dusseda brother to donna francisca passing by that way with the count daltamire she made them a sign to draw near and told them with her fingers what had happened the two lords labored all they could to make up the quarrel between the two rivals and succeeded in it however this accident could not be kept so secret but that the king being informed of it forbid them the court  the duke de sejar parted from hence to go and serve in flanders in quality of a volunteer he was a person of illustrious birth very rich and very young the reason he did this was only because he was jealous of his lady the count de talara had the place of judge of the forests conferred upon him which was vacant by the death of the marquess de la guard and don francisco de manserato obtained the title of marquess de tamarit the king ordered the council to discharge all the receivers of the impositions that are laid upon the provinces these officers were above a thousand and the suppressing of them must needs be of great advantage to his catholic majesty and to his subjects  a vessel which came to cales from the honduras brought news that the flota was happily arrrived on the fifth of september and that the merchants of lima offered three hundred thousand crowns to the king on condition that for an year and half he would not send the gallions here in the mean time ill weather hindered the fleet which had set sail from cales a little before from doubling the cape of st vinoent the bad effects of this tempest were not only perceived at sea for it was so violent in all parts of castile that several houses were beaten down and the exceeding rains so swelled the rivers that the roads were orflown and almost all the bridges carried away by the rapidity of the waters  this ill news was followed immediately by three couriers one upon the neck of another and the first of them arrived on the thirteenth of march from abbot masserati envoy of spain in portugal he dispatched them to inform the council that they had received advice at lisbon by a vessel that the governor of buenosaires having got together abundance of indians had joined them to his garrison that on the   th of august    0 he had surprised the fort which the portugueses had began to build in the isle of st gabriel that he had taken the governor prisoner and cut the garrison in pieces that the princeregent being provoked at this insult had assembled the council of state where the queen of portugal was present that they had resolved to raise the militia and send  00 horse and four regiments of old soldiers into estramadura that it would be necessary to get magazines ready on the frontiers and to have a general rendezvous at eluas that having demanded audience of the princeregent he had refused it him and that in all probability a war would ensue twas expected at court that the envoy of portugal would make his complaints but they were extremely surprised to see him take no notice of it at all so now it was not doubted but that this silence certainly presaged a surprise of the spanish territories like to that which the governor of buenosaires had committed in the indies upon the portugueses the ministers judged it convenient to prevent this blow and spoke to the english ambassador about it desiring him to represent to the envoy of portugal that the king of england would be obliged to take up arms against him who first broke the peace whereof he was guarantee that he had also a more particular reason than this forasmuch as by the league that was concluded between the king his master and his catholic majesty they had mutually engaged to declare against the enemy that fell upon either of them this discourse was spoke with a great deal of heat but the envoy of portugal answered him that he looked upon him to be a partisan of the court of spain rather than an ambassador from the king of england that he knew very well he spoke without order and of his own head this answer was followed by a protestation in writing wherein it was declared that the king of england could not upon any reason whatever hinder the prince of portugal from using the right of reprisals and endeavoring to get satisfaction from the spaniards for the injuries received  a little after this the envoy of portugal received an order from the prince regent to demand public audience upon this occasion and told his catholic majesty that he demanded an entire satisfaction from him and that the prince regent desired that they would set the soldiers and governor at liberty that they would punish those of buenosaires that they would restore the ammunition and cannon that if the fort were razed they would rebuild it or else surrender the place that in case the prisoners were sent into spain they would set them at liberty that they would receive into the port of st gabriel the garrison which the prince of portugal should send thither that the governor of buenosaires should be chastised and that an answer be given in within twenty days or else they would begin actions of hostility upon this the council met and spent three days to deliberate about it they gave orders for their forces to march toward the most exposed defenseless places and don antonio panyagua mastergeneral of the camp was charged to stay there till he saw an end of this affair  besides they set forth a great memorial wherein were contained the arguments which the envoy of spain had given in at lisbon to make it appear by authentic papers that according to the limits appointed by pope alexander vi the isle of st gabriel belongs to the spaniards and that they have had it a hundred and fourscore and six years in their possession after this they took notice of the declaration of the envoy of portugal and ended all with a protestation signifying that they were desirous to preserve the peace and that they would labor with all application in this matter this manifesto was sent to all the foreign ministers to communicate to their masters but they had scarce given it to them when they sent in all haste back back again for the copies to correct something or other and then they returned them again at the same time a rumor was industriously dispersed that the nuncio by an express order from the pope had moved them to send an ambassador to lisbon to treat about an accommodation but this was really a temperament they had found out to conceal the true motives which engaged them to make this advance the nuncio upon this said openly that he had never interposed in the business and that it was impossible to receive any orders from rome about so fresh an affair  the duke de giovennazzo was chosen for this embassy as soon as he was arrived at lisbon he saw the princeregent who nominated the duke de cadaval and the marquess de fronteyra for commissioners he would have made his complaints at first and demanded satisfaction but he was told that they were of a humor clearly opposite to what he pretended and that matters were to be done conformable to the memorial which the envoy of portugal had presented at madrid or else let the affair go whither it would for them after some slight contestations he gave his consent to it and dispatched a courier to madrid to inform the court of what he had done immediately the ministers bellowed out against him as a man of no judgment who had violated his fidelity to the king pretending that he had infringed all the rules of prudence and good sense by a conduct and an accommodation so disadvantageous to spain and that his instructions furnished him with no such power all these circumstances of indignnation and resentment were only offered to the honor of the nation but notwithstanding all this they did not lose a moment to conclude the accommodation and the ratification of it was speedily sent to the duke de giovenazzo  money still continued to be as scarce as ever at madrid and certain it is that it was the greatest difficulty in the world for the council to provide a hundred and fifty thousand crowns for the king to go to aranjuez the ceremonial of the palace whereof i have already made mention orders this sum precisely to be spent in that small journey and here they are so exact to follow it that they would not for all the world lay out a hundred pistoles less but after the money was once in the kings coffers the council thought to send it to the forces that were kept on the borders of portugal by reason of the late difference about the isle of st garbiel the duke de medina celi spoke to the king about it and proposed that in this juncture they might take money where ever they could find it but he roundly answered him do what you will provided you dont meddle with that which is designed for aranjuez he was not able to go thither all the autumn because such a sum of money as is necessary for that purpose could not be then gotten ready he began his journey about the beginning of april      being not willing to break any of the customs that are established in the ceremonial of the palace philip ii observed it religiously and after him the kings of spain have looked upon it as sacred as a law every thing is there set down the processions the chases the solemn days of chapel the changing of their apartments their habits their walks their journeys the presents the kings make their mistresses and what is to become of them when they cease to love them any longer in a word there is to be found every thing from the most essential circumstance of state down to the most insignificant trifles the king tarried five weeks at aranjuez this royal house is within seven leagues of madrid he goes no where all the year round but there and to the escurial in october these are his two great journeys  i went thither along with a relation of mine to take leave of the queen and receive her protection for a young girl whom i was to leave behind me in spain and was very dear to me she told me she would take her into the number of her menines and that i might assure my self she carried her own recommendation along with her since she came from france she honored me with her picture in enamel incircled with diamonds and i sensibly regret the loss of it to this very day this is not a fit place to tell how this misfortune happened to me perhaps i may still write the memoirs of another court where i resided some time and
