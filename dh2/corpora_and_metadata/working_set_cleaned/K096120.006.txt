m dcc xc  a description of china from amiot verbiest lockyer premare du halde le compte dampier cunningham kircher and others chap iv continued the gardens of the chinese are generally very small nature is their plan and their whole study is to imitate her in all her delightful irregularities the first consideration is the form of the ground whether it be flat sloping hilly or mountainous extensive or of small compass of a dry or marshy nature abounding with rivers and springs or liable to scarcity of water to all which circumstances they carefully attend choosing such dispositions as humor the ground can be executed with the least expense hide it is defects and set it is advantages in the most conspicuous light such a plan of gardening the english now pursue and are the only nation that has yet thought proper to imitate them to form a garden on the plan of the chinese i will refer my readers to a pamphlet lately published called elements of modern gardening with the art of embellishing the views round about our houses wherein every necessary instruction is given   not being great lovers of walking we seldom meet with avenues or spacious walks as in european plantations the whole ground is laid out in a variety of scenes and you are led by winding passages cut in the groves to different points of view each terminated by a seat a building or some other object  the perfection of these gardens consists in the number beauty and diversity of the scenes chinese gardeners like european painters collect from nature the most pleasing objects which they endeavor to combine in such a way as not only to appear to the best advantage separately but to unite in forming an elegant and striking whole  their artists distinguish three different species of scenes to which they give the appellations of pleasing horrid and enchanted their enchanted scenes correspond in a great measure with what we call romantic and in these they make use of several artifices to excite surprise sometimes a rapid stream or torrent shall rush under ground and its turbulent noise shall strike the ear of a passerby without knowing from whence it proceeds at other times they will dispose the rocks buildings and other objects that form the composition in such a manner that the wind shall whistle through the different passages and cavities made in them for the purpose and cause other uncommon sounds they introduce into these scenes all kinds of extraordinary trees plants and flowers form artificial and complicated echoes and let loose different sorts of monstrous birds and animals  in their scenes of horror they introduce impending rocks dark caverns bottomless abysses and impetuous cataracts rushing and tumbling down the mountains on all sides the trees are illformed seemingly torn to pieces by violent tempests some are thrown up by the roots and intercept the course of the torrent appearing as if brought down by the fury of the waters others look as if shattered and blasted by the force of lightning the buildings some in ruins and here and there a miserable hut dispersed in the mountains serve at once to indicate the existence and wretchedness of the inhabitants these dreadful scenes are generally succeeded by pleasing ones knowing how powerfully contrast operates upon the mind the chinese artists constantly practice sudden transitions and a striking opposition of forms colors and shades thus they conduct you from limited prospects to extensive views from objects of horror to scenes of delight from lakes and rivers to plains hills and woods to dark and gloomy colors they oppose such as are brilliant and to complicated forms simple ones distributing by a judicious arangement the different masses of light and shade in such a way as to render the composition at once distinct in its parts and yet striking in the whole  when the ground is extensive and a multiplicity of scenes are to be introduced they generally adapt each to one single point of view but where it is limited and affords no room for variety they endeavor to remedy this defect by disposing the objects so that being viewed from different points they produce different representations and sometimes by an artful disposition such as have no resemblance to each other  in their large gardens they contrive different scenes for morning noon and evening erecting at proper points of view buildings adapted to the recreations of each particular time of the day and in the small ones where as has been observed one arrangement produces many representations they disperse in the same manner at the several points of view buildings which a chinese villa for their use point out the time of day for enjoying the scene in its perfection  as the climate of china is very hot they throw a great deal of water into their gardens in small ones if the situation admits they frequently lay the whole ground under water leaving only some islands and rocks in larger ones they introduce extensive lakes rivers and canals the banks of their lakes and rivers are variegated in imitation of nature being sometimes bare and gravelly sometimes fringed with woods to the waters edge in some places flat scattered with flowers and shrubs in others rocky and forming caverns into which parts of the waters discharge themselves with noise and violence sometimes you see meadows covered with cattle or ricegrounds that run out into the lakes leaving between them passages for vessels and sometimes groves into which enter in different parts creeks and rivulets sufficiently deep to admit boats their banks being planted with trees whose spreading branches form arbours for boats droop their heads into the water or feather to the ground these generally conduct to some very interesting object such as a magnificent building places on the top of a mountain cut into terraces a casino situated in the midst of a lake a summerroom built under the water with steps leading from the shore and surrounded with glass to see the fish as they swim over and about them a cascade a grotto cut into a variety of apartments an artificial rock and many other inventions  their rivers are seldom strait but serpentine broken into many irregular points sometimes they are narrow noisy and rapid at others deep spreading and slow both in their rivers and lakes are seen reeds and other aquatic plants and flowers and over these they frequently erect mills and other hydraulic machines to enliven the scenes by their motion they have also a great number of vessels on these waters of different forms and sizes in their lakes they intersperse islands some of which shall be barren and surrounded with rocks and shoals and others enriched with every thing that art and nature can furnish most perfect they likewise form artificial rocks and in compositions of this kind surpass all other nations the making them is a distinct profession and there are at canton and probably in most other cities of china numbers of artificers constantly employed in this business the stone they are made of is brought from the southern coasts of china is of a bluish cast and worn into irregular forms by the action of the waves the chinese are exceedingly nice in the choice of this stone insomuch that a large price has been given for a bit no bigger than a mans fist when it has happened to be of a beautiful form and lively color but these select pieces they use in landscapes for their apartments in gardens they employ a coarser sort which they join with a bluish cement and form rocks of a considerable size when they are large they make them into caves and grottos with openings through which you discover prospects at a distance they cloth them in different places with trees shrubs briers and moss placing on their tops little temples or other buildings to which you ascend by rugged and irregular steps cut in such rock  when they have a sufficient supply of water and proper ground their gardens are never without cascades in these works they avoid all regularity following nature according to her operations in a mountainous country in some places water shall burst from among the caverns and windings of the rocks in others a large and impetuous cataract shall appear and in others again are seen many gentler and lesser falls sometimes the view of a cascade shall be intercepted by trees whose leaves and branches shall scarce leave room to discover the waters as they pass down the mountainsside and high wooden bridges are frequently thrown from one rock to another over the steepest part of the cataract and its passage often interrupted by trees and heaps of stones that seem to be brought down by the violence of the torrent  in their plantations they vary the form and colors of their trees mixing such as have large and spreading branches with those of pyramidal figures and dark greens with lighter interspersing among them such as produce flowers of which they have some that bloom great part of the year the weeping willow is one of their favorite trees and always among those that border their lakes and rivers being so planted as to have its branches hanging over the water they likewise introduce trunks of decayed trees sometimes erect sometimes lying on the ground and are very nice about their form and color of their bark and moss  various are the artifices they use to surprise sometimes they lead you through caverns and gloomy passages at quitting which you are on a sudden struck with a view of a delicious landscape enriched with every thing luxuriant nature affords most beautiful at other times you are conducted through avenues and walks that gradually diminish and grow rugged until the passage is quite intercepted and rendered impassable by bushes briars and stones when unexpectedly again a rich and extensive prospect opens to the view so much the more pleasing as it was the less looked for  another of their artifices is to hide some part of a composition by trees or other intermediate objects this naturally excites the curiosity of the spectator to take a nearer view when he is surprised by some unlookedfor scene or some representation totally opposite to the thing he expected the termination of their lakes they always hide leaving room for the imagination to work and the same rule they observe in other compositions where it can be put in practice  though the chinese are not well versed in optics yet experience has taught them that objects appear less and grow dim in proportion as they are further removed from the eye these discoveries have given rise to an artifice in circumscribed grounds which they sometimes carry into execution this is forming perspective as a painter does upon a canvas by diminishing the objects in size and color in proportion to their supposed distance thus they introduce buildings vessels and other objects smaller and smaller according as they are more distant in point of sight and by this give an idea of much greater extent and that the deceptions may be still more striking they give a greyish tinge to the distant parts of the composition and plant in the remoter parts of these scenes trees of a fainter green and smaller growth than those which appear in front or in the foreground  though they generally avoid strait lines they do not always reject them they sometimes form avenues when they have any interesting object to expose to view roads they always make strait unless the unevenness of the land or other impediments prevent it for expedition in traveling is what every one wishes and it is not natural say they to suppose men would travel a crooked or roundabout way if they could go by a strait one  what an english gardener calls clumps the chinese are not unacquainted with but do not make such frequent use of them as we do they never fill a whole piece of ground with clumps they consider a piece of ground as painters do a picture and group their trees in the same manner as they do their figures having their principal and subservient masses  in short the chinese manner of laying out grounds is very difficult and not to be attained by persons of narrow intellects for though the principles are simple and obvious it yet requires genius judgment and experience a strong imagination and a perfect knowledge of the human mind to put them in execution their whole country indeed is a garden dressed and laid out in the manner i have here described nay as i have observed before they cut their largest mountains into forms  chap v of the people their customs and manners one of those things that have been thought most incredible and contradictory by europeans is the prodigious population of china amiot who has been at great pains to investigate this point says it contains at present two hundred millions of inhabitants this enormous population may appear astonishing but were we to weigh the proofs and follow the reasoning of this missionary we should find his account no way exagerated  by a register taken in    0 the number of people were           ditto in                giving an increase in the course of a year of          and as it is proved by facts that the population of china for a long time past has been progressively increasing and    years has elapsed since the last numeration may we not suppose that this empire contains at present not less than  00000000 of course it must be allowed that no sovereign in the universe commands so many people united in the same society and governed by the same laws and what can such an inexhaustable increase of people in that remote corner of asia be owing to no precise answer can be given to this question but the following are the most apparent causes the vast extent of cultivation is one great physical cause and this is seconded and assisted by the influence of the following moral and political institutions   the strict observance of filial duty and the privileges of a father which makes a son his best and safest property   the infamy attached to the memory of those who die without posterity   that universal custom that makes the marriage of children the principal concern of parents   the honors bestowed by government on those widows that do not enter a second time into the state of matrimony   frequent adoptions which prevent the extinction of families   the return of wealth to its original stock by disinheriting of daughters   the retirement of wives which renders them more attentive to their husbands saves them from a number of accidents when with child and constrains them to employ themselves in the care of their children   the marriage of the soldiers   the fixed rate of taxes which being always laid on lands never fall but indirectly on the trader and mechanic  0 the small number of sailors and travelers to these may be added the great number of people who reside in china only by intervals the profound peace the empire enjoys the frugal and laborious manner in which the opulent live the little attention that is paid to the vain and ridiculous prejudice of not marrying below ones rank the ancient policy of distinction to men not to families by attaching nobility only to employments and talents without suffering it to become hereditary and lastly decency of public manners and a total ignorance of scandalous intrigues and ruinous gallantry  in so large a country it cannot be expected but that the complexions and features if not the stature of the distant inhabitants must vary if it is not difficult to distinguish a north from a south briton or an englishman from a frenchman how much more distinguishable must the people of the north of china be from those of the south who are  0 degrees of latitude distant from each other therefore when some authors say they are fair and others tawny they may both speak truth but speak of different provinces however it seems to be admitted by most writers that the major part of the chinese for the tartars we have already described are squat wellset men with broad faces black hair small dark eyes short noses and thin beards which they wear long on the bottom of the chin and upper lips but pull it from their cheeks with tweezers the gentry and the literati suffer the nails of their left hand to grow two or three inches longer than their fingers to distinguish them from mechanics  the chinese admire one that is tall and fat a little above the common size and if he has a broad forehead little eyes a short nose great ears a little mouth and a long beard he is considered as a complete beauty their ears are universally long broad dangling thick open and soft with little or no border and of a substance rather fleshy than cartilaginous a loud voice especially in a magistrate is also with them a fine accomplishment the women who are kept up and not exposed to the sun are fair enough and excepting their little eyes and short noses may view hour europn beauties and their excessive modesty adds much to their charms their foreheads are large their eyebrows small and well arched their eyes black but almost hid with the lid their mouths little with plump vermilion lips their cheeks and chin of a fine symmetry the neck small arms long and slender and pretty small hands the nails of their fingers are never pared but kept very clean so that they are more than two inches long to show that they are not employed in servile work but what is most remarkable is their little feet in which their principal beauty is thought to lie and to give and preserve their beauty great pains is taken to keep them as small as when they first came into the world scarcely is a girl born but the nurse binds up her feet so right that they cannot grow and this torture must be endured until the feet has naturally done growing owing to this a chinese woman rather drags herself along than walks but a small foot is to her so great an ornament that she thinks she cannot pay too dear for it and her feet of course are no larger than those of a child of three years old some attribute this custom to jealousy whilst others consider it as a political expedient to keep them at home and in a state of dependence indeed a chinese woman is condemned to an almost perpetual imprisonment in her apartment and to be visible to none but her husband and a few domestics and yet she will employ as much time every day as an english beauty who wishes to shine at a ball or an opera  in cities the dress of the chinese is agreeable to the gravity they affect and almost the same among people of both classes for there are but two gentry and people in trade and both sexes but certain accessory ornaments distinguish the rank of thse that wear them and those insignia being regulated by government severe chastisement would be the consequence to any one who should presume to put on a dress not authorized  the general dress consists of a long vest which folds over the breast and reaches to the ground it is fastened on the right sde by four or five gold or silver buttons the sleeves are wide at the shoulders growing narrower to the wrist where they terminate in form of a horseshoe covering the whole hand and leaving the ends of the fingers only to be seen the vest is tied round the waist with a sik sash the ends of which reach to the knees from this girdle hangs a knife in a sheath with a pair of chopsticks which they use as forks in summer their necks are bare but in winter and cold weather they cover them with a satin cape sewed to their vest and edged with fur and the vest itself is also trimmed with sheepskin or quilted with silk and cotton people of rank line theirs with sable or the finest foxskins trimmed with sable and in spring with ermine over this vest they wear also a kind of surtout that reaches to the waist with wide short sleeves ending at the elbow this is also in cold weather lined with fur  under this vest both men and women wear wide short shirts of different kinds of cloth according to the season rather made like a waistcoat that folds over the bosom and with close narrow sleeves fastened at the wrist they wear also a pair of drawers of the same over these a pair of trowsers made of linen silk or satin and lined occasionally with furs as they can afford under the shirt some wear a silk net to prevent it sticking to the skin people of condition never go out but in boots generally made of quilted satin silk or cotton but always dyed of some color these boots have neither heel nor top they are made to fit the foot with great exactness and slippers worn over them when they ride these boots are made of leather but soft and pliable under their boots they wear bootstockings of quilted stuff lined with cotton reaching above the top of the boot and ornamented with a velver or silk border in summer these stockings are made of cooler materials the foot of the boot is like the leg of course slippers must be necessary which have good substantial soles  they had retained the same fashion in their clothes and habits above  000 years when the tartars obliged them to cut off their hair and make some little alteration in their dress which alteration still continues they cannot reconcile themselves to wear wigs or draw on straight or tight stockings or breeches discovering so much leg and thigh as do the europeans dressed however according to these former fashions and the rule of state a chinese never forgets his fan he would as soon forget his boots and so necessary do they consider the chinese boot that when any one pays them a visit and their boots are not on they will make their friend wait till they put them on  the dress of a villager differs from that worn by those who live in towns in the same proportion as in other countries it consists of a coarse linen frock over which is thrown a cotton vest that reaches to the middle of the thigh he has a pair of large drawers that reach to his ancle his wooden shoes terminate at the toe in a sharp point and are turned backwards  le comte says persons of condition will often at home and among their friends use a freedom not commendable that is stripping themselves quite naked except a pair of thin transparent drawers and that this is the more surprising as they condemn all nakedness in pictures nay he says the vulgar in the southern provinces will transgress all bounds of modesty in this respect and watermen and workmen will go abroad in the public streets without either cap stockings or shirt by which they are much tanned and swarthy  in those paintings which we have of the chinese they appear to be bald they are not so naturally that small portion of hair which they preserve on the tops of their heads or behind is all that is allowed by custom it is generally very long and plaited into a tail in summer they cover their heads with a cap formed like an inverted funnel or a bell which does not reach to their ears these are made with rattan or cane very prettily wrought and lined with satin with a tuft of deep red hair on the point at top which spreads over it and covers it to the brim this hair is that which grows between the legs of a certain species of cow very fine and takes any color readily any one may wear this some will have on the top of this cap a button of amber or glass which glitters and the hairfringe flowing in the wind has a pretty effect in winter these caps are made of plush turned up with fur and being very shallow are tied under the chin with a string the wintercaps of the gentry will from the value of the fur cost sometimes ten or twelve pounds sterling when they ride in bad weather their surtouts caps and vests are made of green oiled skin  there is another cap which mandarins and the literati have only a right to wear made in the form above but lined with red satin and covered with white with red silk fringe flowing from the top instead of hair  when they visit any person of quality or go abroad they wear a long silk gown generally blue over which they have a black or violetcoloured cloak that almost touches their knees made very wide with wide and short sleeves  the color of their mourning is white among all classes the whole dress white in the first months of mourning for parentss their habit is a kind of linen bag of a bright red and as coarse as packingcloth the girdle of cord and the cap of hempen cloth but this is succeeded by the uniform white dress  a son has no right to wear mourning whilst his father and mother lives but when he mourns for them it must continue three years and after this triennial mourning is out his dress ever after must be of one color silks and furs are forbidden to children and the first cap they wear is presented them by law as to time of wearing and is placed on their heads by the master of the ceremonies who addresses them in the following words consider that you now receive the dress of those who have attained to maturity and that you cease to be children renounce therefore all childish thoughts and inclinations assume a grave and serious deportment apply yourself closely to the study of virtue and wisdom and endeavor to merit a long and happy life the chinese give a kind of importance to every thing that can inspire youth with a taste for morality and a love of good order it might be useful to society to remind men at certain epochs of their lives of the new duties imposed on them by each successive change but by uniting the solemnity of a public ceremony to this instruction is certainly the way to make a greater impression and imprint it longer on the memory  in short the law has regulated every thing with respect to dress and even fixed the colors that distinguish the different ranks emperors and princes of the blood alone wear yellow certain mandarins are entitled to wear red satin on days of ceremony but at other times they are clothed in black blue or violet peacocks feather in their caps are also badges of distinction but none wear more than one except the emperor and same few grandees who wear two the common people are confined to blue or black and the dress is composed always of plain cotton cloth  i shall not enlarge so much on the female dress which seems in shape and form to have been dictated by modesty and seconded by jealousy their robes are close at top reach to the chin and so long as to cover their toes in shape like a powdering gown the slevees if not held up would hang down to the ground of course their hands are seldom seen a chinese woman conceals every thing but her face as to color of dress this is arbitrary women in advanced life generally wear black or violetcoloured  young women seem to be acquainted with paint at least such paint as gives a bloom to their cheeks and sets off the delicacy of their complexions it is not like european paint except making the face soon appear wrinkled  map of tibet with the adjacent country map of tibet  there general headdress consists in the arrangement of their hair forming it into a variety of curls interspersed with small tufts of gold or silver flowers some make part of it up into a roll fasten it with silver bodkins and let the rest flow down the neck in ringlets in cold weather in peking they wrap it round with a kind of black hood du halde says some ornament their heads with the figure of a fabulous bird of which antiquity has related many wonderful things this bird is made of copper or silver gilt according to the rank of those who wear it its wings extended lie pretty close to their headdress before embracing the upper part of their temples while its long spreading tail forms a kind of plume on the top of the head its body is directly over the forehead and the neck and tail hang down but the former being joined to the body by an invisible swivel plays freely about and moves with the least motion of the head the whole bird adheres to the head by its claws which are fixed in the hair ladies of the first rank sometimes wear an ornament composed of several of these birds united together forming a kind of crown the workmanship alone of this ornament is very expensive see the plate of chinese music  young ladies wear also a kind of crown made of pasteboard covered with fine stuff or silk the forepart of which rises in a point above the forehead and is covered with pearls diamonds and other costly ornaments the rest of the head is decorated with flowers either natural or artificial among which are intersperd small dd    ldies wrap their heads round with a piece of fine silk  english ladies do theirs with broad ribband for a  headdress  the tartar ladies dress somewhat different from the chinese their robes are equally long and close at the neck  one does not reach so low as totally to  they wear on their breasts a kind of very large  and on their head a hat much like those  ldie but lss ornamented and put on more behind they are often seen with a long pipe in their hands with the use of which they are well acquainted  the chinse are far from being whimsical or superstitious in their d they not only eat all kinds of flesh fish and f as europeans do but horseflesh is in great esteem  dog cats snakes frogs or  of vermin refused but rice roots  and  a the common food flesh and  with rice mixed salt and pepper are never brought to table all meat being seasoned in the dressing they eat their flesh boiled fried and broiled but before it is served up it is cut into little square pieces like d they use neither cloth napkins knives spoon or fork but two little round ebony sticks called chopsticks sometimes tipped at the ends with silver with which they take up their meat very dexterously and for their rice and broth they hold the cup to their mouths and lade it in with their chopsticks contrary to all eastern customs where persons sit crosslegged on the floor at meals they use high chairs and tables almost every one has a small lacquered table to himself at an entertainment on which he sets his meat and rice in little china dishes or saucers and sometimes in plates  tea is their principal liquor wine they have none though the country abounds in fine grapes neither do they brew beer from barley but distill strong liquors from rice and wheat cold water they never drink their water being generally bad and not fit to be drank until boiled and corrected by the infusion of herbs or mixed with spirits  the two principal strong liquors our seamen mention who go that voyage are hockshue and samshue the first is of the color of brown beer but very clear and strong said to be an infusion of wheat in scalding hot water and tastes more like mum than beer samshue is a spirit distilled from rice a kind of arrack and either of a pale or reddish color and is what some travelers have called wine as to their tea it is a beverage our sailors leave to the natives which they drink without sugar in the morning a large tin vessel is made full of it to serve the family for that day this tin vessel is covered very close and put into another vessel of wood which keeps the tea warm all day and is drawn off into cups by a cock when company is in the house every person has a cup with a close cover set before him and tea of such kind or quantity as the person pleases is put into it after which a person attends with a saucepan of boiling water to pour into each cup  these people generally eat their meat cold but drink their liquor hot and so much ceremony is used at their entertainments that it must very much lessen the pleasure of eating and drinking and the ceremonial of the invitation is no less complex and troublesome than that of the entertainment an invitation is not supposed to be given with sincerity until it has been renewed three or four times in writing a card is sent on the evening before another in the morning of the appointed day and a third when every thing is prepared and nothing to be done but to sit down to table the master of the house always introduces his guests into the hall where he salutes them one after another he then orders wine made from rice to be brought to him in a small cup made of silver porcelain or some precious wood and placed on a small varnished salver he takes this in both hands makes a bow to all the surrounding company advances toward the forepart of the hall which generally looks into a large court and raising his eyes and the cup toward heaven pours out the wine on the ground in imitation of the wellknown libations of antiquity  this done he pours fresh wine into his cup makes a bow to the most considerable person present and places  the table set apart for that guest who in ren  for a cup of wine and advances to place it on the  for the master of the feast who endeavors to prevent him and makes a thousand apologies according to the rules of chinese politeness at these feasts each person has a table for himself and the masters table is below all the rest  a superior domestic or maitre dhotel conducts the chief guest to an elbow chair covered with rich flowered silk who after some apologies for taking the first seat sits down the rest of the company follow his example and sit without asking in order to abridge the ceremony the principal place is always given to persons of greatest age and dignity and to a stranger before all others though younger and of an inferior rank  the tables are ranged in two lines with a large space left between them scarcely are the company seated but four or five comedians richly dressed i am speaking of great entertainments enter the hall who all bow together so low that their heads touch the ground four times after this one of them presents to the principal guest a lift of the pieces they are able to perform extempore the list is handed round and again returned to him and he then  on the piece the representation begins with the  of  covered with buffalos hide and the sound of flutes fifes trumpets and some other instruments used by the chinese only and which would perhaps little please a european  the hallfloor serves the comedians for a stage which on these occasion discovered with a carpet the actors about to perform are placed in some of the adjoining apartments from which they come forth when they are to speak and the guests present are the only spectators but it is usual for the master of the house to admit a certain number of people into the court to be partakers of the amusement even women are indulged with a sight also through a small wiket made of interwoven bamboos covered with a silk net through which they can see without being seen the subject of the plays are generally the history of some saint or hero  the chinese begin these repasts with drinking and it must be always pure wine such as i have before mentioned and the maitre dhotel falling down on one knee invites the guests to take a cup each then lays hold with both hands of that which is placed before him lifts it as high as his forehead then lowers it below the table and afterward put it to his mouth they all drink together very slowly and at three or four draughts the master inducing them to drink the whole by showing them the bottom of his cup that he has done so if any one dont care to drink it is necessary that he should go through all the motions and hold his cup to his head as long as the rest  it is whilst they are drinking always that the domestics remove the dishes from the table and bring in others every person has    dishes in succession served up to him all of which are fat and in the form of ragouts they never begin to eat until the master leads the way and so through every fresh dish when the master of the feast gives the signal their two chopsticks are taken up and flourished they then strike the dish with them and carry them to their mouths all in regular uniform motion as if they were exercising they are to take as much care as possible that their mouths all move together for to be beforehand or make the rest wait is a piece of rudeness when they have thus taken two or three mouthfuls of a dish the signal is given by the master and they all lay down their arms after this they drink as before  during this business says le comte they never speak and will be silent at table three or four hours for they continue eating till tea is introduced after which they rise take a turn or two in the garden or house and then return to the dining room where they find a desert of sweetmeats this desert like the dinner consists of    different things preserved fruits hams and sallad ducks dried in the sun with sheil and other kinds of small fish the same ceremonies are again attended to but the larger cups of wine are brought no person is however urged to drink more than he likes provided all the motions are gone through these entertainments begin at the close of the day and never end till midnight as it was customary in england to give money to servants so it is here the quality of the entertainer date mines the sum and this little contribution is always carried to the master who distributes it among his servants but money is only given when the entertainment has been accompanied with a comedy  each returns home in a chair preceded by several persons who carry large lanthrns of oiled paper on which the quality and some times the name of their master is inscribed in large characters whoever ventures to go abroad at such an hour without such an attendance would be stopped by the guard the next day a card of thanks is returned to the officer of the watch  the chinese have the secret of salting large quantities of their flesh in such a manner that it loses nothing of its original flavor they also salt their eggs by covering them with a coat of clay mixed with salt and so salted they will keep for years were they steeped in brine it would not penetrate through the pores of the shell but observation has taught the chinese that clay alone impregnated with salt has this property these salted eggs are very wholesome and even sick persons are permitted to eat them  we have already said that all their dishes are in the form of ragouts but all very different in taste highly seasoned and much less expensive than ours french cooks says du halde who have refined upon every thing that can awaken and excite the appetite would be much surprised to see that the chinese have carried the powers of invention with respect to ragouts much farther than they and at a much smaller expense spices and strong herbs combined in different proportions produce this variety  of all the dishes served up at the entertainments of the great none are more esteemed than stags sinews and the nests of a particular species of birds the former they dry in the sun afterward cover them with nutmeg and pepper and shut them in a close vessel for use when they dress them they steep them in ricewater to soften them stew them in kidbroth and season them with a variety of spices  the nests are procured from the rocks and are made by a bird something like our swallows and in the same way not with clay but small fishes which they have the art of cementing together with a kind of scum that is found floating on the surface of the sea these nests are torn from the rocks as soon as the young ones have taken flight whole barks are loaded with them and they become a very profitable branch of commerce for the inhabitants of those places the property of this food is to give an agreeable relish to whatever is mixed with it  the inhabitants of the southern provinces feed more on rice than wheat though there is abundance of the latter in the country they make it into small loaves and bake them in less than a quarter of an hour by holding them over the steam of boiling water which makes them exceedingly soft and tender they also make thin cakes of wheat mixed with herbs that is very pleasant to the taste  their wine has no resemblance to ours as to taste or quality it is made from rice by sleeping and boiling it and they distill a spirit from the flesh of sheep the chinese are naturally sober citizens in easy circumstances live chiefly upon pork eating it every day but this meat is easier of digestion and more agreeable to the taste than ours chinese hams are in great estimation  the ceremonies of the chinese are part of their consitution every man is obliged to observe them even tradesmen servants seamen and husbandmen have their respective forms assigned them which the state conceives tend much to their civilization and that the frequent use of the many outward condescensions and mild expressions enjoined by government and the seeming affection they are taught to express for one another tends to promote peace and order and produce mutual good will and that the forbearance of scurrilous and provoking language prevents many quarrels oaths and obscene discourse are never heard among them  but the ceremonies of the chinese depend more upon positive laws than custom the law has regulated every thing on this head every one from the highest mandarin to the humblest individual is perfectly acquainted with the titles he must give to others and what is due to himself the honors and compliments he can accept and those which he ought to pay in china there are no disputes about rank or precedence every one knows his situation and as among our people of quality take the lead according to their rank  a visit in china is a business of great solemnity requiring formal preliminaries which europeans are unacquainted with familiar friends visit without much ceremony but for all others there is a form prescribed visits from the inhabitants of any city to a governor are always attended with presents as soon as the visitors reach the hall where the governor gives audience they all range themselves in a line make a profound reverence on his coming in throw themselves on their knees and bend their heads even to the earth unless raised up by the governor which is generally done sometimes the most considerable among them takes a cup of wine in both hands and presents it to the governor pronouncing aloud by way of prayer tosiou that is behold the wine which brings happiness or cheoutsiou behold the wine that brings length of days after him another advances with sweetmeats presenting them with behold the sugar of longlife others repeat the same ceremonies three times with the same wishes when a governor has any way distinguished himself the literati of his district cause a dress to be made for him composed of square pieces of different colored satin and present to him on his birthday amidst the sound of several musical instruments and puts it over him this vestment is worn but once but preserved in his family as a badge of distinction and is made up of so many different colors to represent different nations and to inform the mandarin he is worthy of ruling them all  a visit to a superior is always made before dinner before the visitor has tasted wine the smell of such a thing would be a gross affront but if a visit is returned the same day it may be after dinner no person can pay a visit without previously sending a card to the porter of the person the visit is to be made to this card is of red paper ornamented with flowers and folded like a screen the visitors name is written in one of the folds and many respectful expressions in the other if the visit is to an intimate friend or person of ordinary rank the tie tsee or visitingcard is only a leaf of plain paper if the person sent to is in mourning a leaf of black paper sometimes these visits as in england are made and returned by merely sending the card  when the visitor arrives at the house of a superior he is introduced into the hall by a couple of servants who hold an umbrella and their masters fan inclined to each other so as to form a screen behind which the visitor stands concealed likewise behind a large fan which an attendant of his own holds up before him and these barriers are not removed until the visitor has advanced near enough to the master if the house to salute him who never moves from his chair if the person visited be much the inferior he goes out into the street to conduct the stranger in they bow low to each other as soon as they meet and a set of short compliments are prescribed one knows what he is to say the other what to answer at every door they halt and bow and dispute who shall enter first but few expressions are used on this occasion one says tsin which is pray walk in the other pau can it must not be this being repeated four or five times the stranger suffers himself to be overcome and goes to the next roomdoor where the same ceremony is repeated  when the visitor or visitors are all entered then commence all those formalities which are so minutely pointed out in the chinese book of ceremonies this book determines the number of salutations to be made by bending the head toward the breast the complimentary expressions that must be used the reciprocal bendings of the knee that each must make the steps to be taken to the right or left and the manner of presenting the right hand all this gone through they bow to the chairs dust them with their great sleeves and after a quarter of an hours grimace seat themselves opposite to each other they are obliged to sit upright without leaning with downcast looks their hands stretched out on their knees and their feet even they are to look grave and composed and not be too talkative sometimes not a word is said but the prescribed compliments which are spoken with all imaginary submission and always in the third person as the favor your lordship has done one so much beneath him lays his servant under the highest obligations permit the servant to offer his lord this curiosity which his poor country affords they never say i or you but your servant or your scholar and the doctor or my lord said this not you said it you did it such familiar expressions would be rude and vulgar they seldom fatigue themselves with talking indeed they affect so much gravity and say so little in company that they resemble statues or figures placed in chairs for ornament one missionary avers that a mandarin paid him a visit and did not open his mouth the whole time he was with him but to return  a little time after as many cups of tea are brought in as there are persons present and the manner of taking up the cup conveying it to the mouth and returning it to the servant form so many articles of this book of ceremonies and are always performed with the most rigid minuteness and punctuality ambassadors are allowed masters of the ceremonies to instruct them  0 days before they are admitted to an audience that they may not commit blunders and many of the chinese will be offended even with strangers if they omit to fawn and cringe according to the rules prescribed  the ceremonies at departure are equally formal the master of the ceremonies conducts you to your chair waits till you are taken up and bids you adieu in saluting each other they never uncover their heads to be bareheaded they consider as indecent and in conformity to this national custom the pope thought fit to dispense with the converts appearing in the christian churches in china bareheaded the use of pearls is forbidden in china and if any presents are sent and not accepted as is often the case they are always returned with a note of thanks and pifie that is these are pearls i dare not touch them or if some are kept and others returned it is with yupi or with regard to the rest they are valuable pearls  when a stranger is about to take horse after a visit and return home this cannot be effected without great ceremony for he will not be so rude as to mount before the master of the house who on the contrary urges him to it the stranger then protests that the world shall be turned upside down before he will be so rude the master rather suffers this retires out of sight and when his visitor is seated in his saddle returns and bids him adieu and when the stranger is gone a little way a servant is dispatched after him to wish him a good journey  epistolary correspondence even among private friends is always attended with established ceremonies which are more complicated if a letter is written to a person of rank it is then necessary to use a piece of white paper with ten or twelve folds the letter must begin in the second and the signature be written in the last even the characters used differ according to circumstances the smaller they are the more respectful the style the words used and the distance used between the lines are also to be suited to the rank of the person wrote to two seals must be affixed to the letter one over the signature and the other over the beginning when written such letter is folded in a cover ornamented with flowers as is now adopted in france in this is written nayhan the letter is within and this put into another cover directed closed and sealed at both ends with the words hou fong secured and sealed  the form of salutation in china even among persons of moderate rank is much less expeditious than ours a common salute consists in joining both hands together before the breast moving them in an affectionate manner bending the head a little and saying reciprocally tsintsin pronounced chinchin a complimentary word something like your humble servant but which means no humility when a person meets one of superior rank he joins his hands by locking the fingers together raises them above the forehead and afterward brings them down toward the earth making a profound bow with the whole body when two friends meet after a long absence they both fall on their knees opposite to each other bend their bodies to the earth then raise them up and repeat the same two or three times at an ordinary interview the common phrase is how do you do and the answer is caolaoyehungfo well thanks to your abundant felicity when they see a man in good health the first address is yungfo that is prosperity is painted in your looks or you have a happy countenance  when two mandarins of royal rank meet in the street in their chairs each joins his hands as before lowers them down and then raises them to his forehead and repeats this till they are out of each others sight but if one of the two be of higher rank than the other the latter orders his chair to stop or if he is on horseback he dismounts and makes a profound bow to his superior i have seen this with gentlemen in england and the same compliment paid by a gentleman to a lady in a word politeness in china is as general in villages as in towns and being established by law is attended with as little sincerity n one as the other when a person pays his obedience to the emperor he falls on his knees and then throws himself prostrate on the ground after the asiatic manner as is represented in the plate of the chinese sepulcher  chap vi their customs and manners continued i will now speak of their amusements as the chinese generally employ their hours in the duties of society they have little inclination or time for amusements being naturally a grave people they seldom assume an air of gaiety but in conformity to custom they have no public theaters their comedians and tragedians are merely strollers that go about from house to house performing for those who are able to pay them  but plays are sometimes performed in the public streets on open scaffolds and in half a dozen streets at a time these actors are richly dressed have a large wardrobe and great variety on each side of the stages are screens but they have no painted scenes when they act in the streets they are paid by the inhabitants of that street when they act in temples as sometimes they do they are paid by the members of that temple no women appearing on the stage female parts are performed by boys or young men of an effeminate cast some companies of players consist of young men from  0 to  0 years of age these the chinese esteem most but europeans admire those between    and    their tragic actors seem to act with great propriety so as to affect the passions of a european spectator though he is ignorant of the language it is the plea of inculcating virtue and ridiculing vice that induces the state to suffer them to perform  the whole streets are so filled on these occasions with a pleased and an attentive crowd that there is no passing when an actor plays his part well he is always encored plays are generally concluded with tumbling fighting or combating with giants or wild beasts or else with some humourous postures antic feats and expressions which create a laugh  gaming and every diversion that tends to promote or encourage idleness is absolutely forbidden to young people but there are instances of grown persons who have followed it so immoderately that they have played away their estates wives and children any of which they will sometimes hazard on a card or the single cast of a die but in general they are ignorant of all games at china  the chinese call chess the game of the elephant and say they had it from the indians about     young maidens are here taught chess and it is reckoned a part of their education holding the same place as dancing does with us  cockfighting is a favorite diversion and hunting which the gentry of england endeavor to confine to themselves is free to every one in china such persons as wish to enjoy the diversion alone shut up a quantity of game in parks for the purpose  when the emperor goes a hunting he selects  0000 of his lifeguards who are armed with darts and javelins these he disposes in such a manner that they quite surround a very large extent of ground upon the mountains the guards thus posted form a large circle marching nearer to each other with an equal pace taking care not to quit their ranks the circle is thus reduced to a much smaller one and the beasts enclosed by the great circle are taken in the smaller one as in a net for now the guards alighting from their horses keep so very close to each other that not the smallest outlet is left for any wildbeast to escape the animals in this small circle are hunted so close that the poor creatures quite spent come and fall down at the feet of the hunters and are thus taken with ease sometimes they will thus take two or  00 hares and a prodigious number of wolves and foxes  once a year the emperor goes into tartary to hunt and at these times often meets with tigers which are the fiercest animals they have but fierce as they are when they find themselves enclosed by a circle of hunters they seem to be struck with a kind of terror at the sight of such a number of enemies all ready to direct the points of their lances against them far from imitating the stag and other animals which so hemmed in run up and down without ceasing and try every means to escape the tiger squats down and endures for a long time without moving the barking of the dogs which are let loose upon him but afterward excited either by excess of rage or the necessity of defending himself he darts forward with prodigious leaps and incredible rapidity to some particular part which he has fixed on and attacks the hunters on that part but they receive him with the points of their lances and plunge them into his belly at the moment he is preparing to seize some one of them  strangers are astonished to see the boldness and intrepidity shown by the tartar horses when they meet with any of these tigers they at first appear frighted at the horrid cries of those terrible animals but become insensibly accustomed to hear and see them and their masters take great pains to inure them to this kind of hunting the metal of such a horse i have already described at a bearchace see the plate vol   p      fishery is considered rather as an object of commerce than amusement but the soldiers have a method of fishing with a bow and arrow the arrow being fixed to the bow by a string is shot if they hit their mark the string enables them to draw the fish to them if not it prevents the arrow from being lost  the chinese can enjoy no amusements but those authorized by law respecting ceremonies their annual public entertainments are established by custom in every city of the third class and the law has determined what degree of people shall be admitted to them they must be either graduate doctors of unspotted reputation mandarins of law or arms who have retired from public life aged heads of families or citizens distinguished for probity and virtue this institution is principally intended to preserve that mutual regard and friendship which is too often forgot in other countries these entertainments consist of eating and drinking and music and are a kind of love feasts regulated in the minutest manner by a mandarin acording to an established ceremony at these assemblies some articles of the law are read and the president adds in the name and by order of the emperor words to this effect if we have been assembled here to this solemn festival it is not so much for the pleasure of eating and drinking as to encourage us to show fidelity to our prince piety to our parents affection to our brothers and sisters esteem for our elders respect for our relations an attachment our friends and a desire to promote peace and concord among our fellowcitizens and neighbors and the airs which are sung and the music which accompanies them all tend to the same end to harmonize and conciliate universal benevolence and affection such a banquet may be truly called a feast of love an assembly of instruction  we have already seen in what manner the emperor of china celebrates the vernal festival this is celebrated on the same day throughout the empire in a way somewhat different but tending to the same end namely the encouragement of moral labor and industry in the morning the governor of every city comes forth from his palace crowned with a chaplet of flowers and enters his chair in which he is carried preceded by music and a number of standardbearers lighted flambeaux etc surrounded and followed by several litters covered with silk carpets on which are effigies of some illustrious persons who have encouraged husbandry or some historical painting on the same subject the houses are hung with carpeting triumphal arches are erected at certain distances lantherns every where displayed and all the houses illuminated a figure made of baked earth representing a cow richly clothed with gilt horns is also carried in procession and so large that  0 men sometimes can scarce support it a child with one foot naked and the other shod called the spirit of labor and diligence follows driving on the image with a rod laborers with all the implements of husbandry march behind and a troop of comedians and people masked whose grotesque appearance and attitudes afford much entertainment to the populace bring up the rear  the governor thus advances to the eastern gate as if he intended to meet the spring and then returns to his palace in the same order after this the cow is stripped of her ornaments and a great number of earthen calves are taken from her belly which are distributed among the crowd the cow herself is broken into pieces and distributed in like manner and the whole is concluded with a speech from the governor in praise of agriculture and an exhortation to the people not to neglect so useful and valuable an art  they have two other festivals celebrated at a prodigious expense one at the commencement of the year which they call taking leave of the old year and the other on the   th of the first month called the feast of lantherns at these times all business is stopped and the tribunals are shut up throughout the empire at the conclusion of the old year also all business whether private or public is suspended presents are given and received inferior mandarins go and pay their respects to their superiors children to their parents and servants to their masters all dressed in their best attire something similar to the visits paid in france on new years day all the family assemble in the evening and partake of a grand repast but no stranger is admitted not one of their nearest relations from a superstitious opinion that they may rob the family of that good fortune which descends on the house with the first moment of the new year but on the next and following days they give lively demonstrations of extraordinary joy every shop is shut feasting and carousing is universal every one appears in his best dress visits are made to relations and friends plays are acted the whole empire is is in motion and nothing goes forward but mirth and rejoicing  on the feast of lantherns every place throughout the empire is so illuminated that if one could take a view of it from some high place all the country would seem in a blaze the festival begins on the   th in the evening and is continued to the   th every person both in city and country on the seacoast and on the rivers light up painted lantherns of several fashions and sizes even the poorest families hang them up in their courtyards and at their windows the wealthy will expend  0 or   l english on this occasion and the chief mandarins the viceroys and emperor will spend two or three hundred  it is a spectacle to all the cities people flock there from all parts and the gates of the city are left open every evening to receive them  these lantherns are very large some square some sexagon and some octagon the frame wood and covered with transparent silk on which is painted flowers animals and human figures others are round and made of a blue transparent kind of horn many lamps and wax candles are put into these lantherns to the corner of each are fixed streamers of satin and silk of different colors and a curious piece of carved work is placed over its top  some of the large lantherns exhibit moving figures in imitation of the ombres chinoises or chinese shades that have been shown in london people who lie concealed by means of imperceptible threads put the figures in motion and we see horses galloping ships sailing armies marching groupes dancing and a variety of spectacles that amuse and divert the people some accompany these moving figures with droll expressions that seem to proceed from the shades on the lanthern others carry about serpents and dragons  0 or  0 feet long illuminated within from the head to the tail and have the art of making them twist themselves in different forms like real serpents  but that which adds new and additional splendour to this festival are the various fireworks the chinese are celebrated for magailens says that he was surprised at one of these exhibitions where an arbor of vines with red grapes was represented and the arbor burnt without being consumed the red grapes the green leaves and the color of the wood was so naturally represented that any person might have taken them for real but their excellence in this art may be better judged from a description of one that was exhibited by the late emperor changhi for the diversion of the court the fireworks began with halfadozen large cylinders planted in the ground which formed in the air so many streams of flames rising to the height of    feet and falling in showers of golden fire this was followed by a covered box supported by two pillars which threw up a shower of fire with several lantherns and sentences written in large characters of burning sulphur and afterward six branched candlesticks forming pillars with different tiers of silvercoloured lights ranged in circles so brilliant as to convert night into day at last the emperor set fire himself to one of the works that was instantly communicated to all sides of the place which was  0 feet long and  0 broad the fire reached several poles and painted figures from whence proceeded a prodigious multitude of skyrockets and at the same time a number of lantherns and branched candlesticks were lighted in every place the english artists in artificial fire have reached this excellence and will light many thousand lamps almost at one and the same time by means of quickmatch which is a string of cotton loaded with gunpowder and enclosed in paper pipes communicating with every lamp  the chinese endeavor to render every public ceremony as grand and striking as possible a viceroy never quits his palace or travels but with a pomp truly royal his common suite consists of  00 men he is then dressed in his official robes and carried in a sumptuous gilt chair on the shoulders of eight domestics preceded by guards and two drummers beating on copper basins eight others carry standards of varnished wood on which are inscribed in large characters all his titles of honor these are followed with    flags symbols of his office six officers bearing boards with inscriptions of gold declaring the good qualities of the viceroy and two carrying a triple umbrella of yellow silk and its cover two archers on horseback precede the first body of guards the latter are followed by others armed behind these are two other parties of soldiers some carrying large maces some iron spikes and others huge hammers and others again behind them bearing battleaxes of different kinds after these proceed another party of soldiers differently armed with triplepointed spears bows and arrows and followed by two men bearing the viceroys seal in a kind of box then come two other drummers announcing his approach followed by two officers with plumes of feathers and two others bearing maces of gilt dragons next a number of magistrates and officers of justice in silk scarfs with whips chains and hangers two standardbearers command this party which immediately precedes the governor pages and footmen surround his chair and an officer attends him carrying a large fan in form of a screen and a number of guards officers and domestics bearing various necessaries for his use bring up the rear  if he marches in the night large beautiful lantherns are carried before him on the transparent part of which his quality titles etc are written in large characters to tell the public who is coming that passengers may stop and such as are sitting rise up with respect whoever omits this obeisance is sure to be bastinadoed  but when the emperor goes forth on any public occasion the following is the procession  twentyfour drummers two and two  twentyfour trumpeters two and two their trumpets three feet long and eight inches diameter at the lower end made of the wood outongchu and ornamented with rings of gold their shape is something like a bell  twentyfour men bearing sticks varnished green seven feet long and decorated with gilt foliage  one hundred soldiers armed with halberts the points of which terminate in a crescent  one hundred macebearers with lances varnished red interspersed with flowers and gilt at the ends  four hundred large beautiful lantherns of elegant workmanship borne by as many men and containing each a flambeaux made of a wood which burns long and gives a great light  two hundred men some carrying lances ornamented with tufts of different colored silks and others tails of foxes panthers and other animals  twentyfour banners on which are painted the signs of the zodiac which the chinese divide into    parts  fiftysix other banners representing different clusters of stars according to their arrangement in the heavens  two hundred fans supported by long gilded poles with the figures of different animals painted on them  the emperor superbly dressed on a beautiful horse richly caparisoned and a superb umbrella of a prodigious size held over him that covers both him and his horse and shelters them from the sun  00 lancebearers pages of the bedchamber and  0 valets each with a led horse surround the monarch the bridles and saddles ornamented with gold and precious stones  all the princes of the blood nobility chief mandarins and stateofficers two and two in their habits of ceremony  five hundred young gentlemen belonging to the palace richly dressed  a thousand footmen in red robes interspersed with flowers and stars embroidered in gold and silver  an open chair carried by    men and guarded by  0  a large chair but shut carried by   0 men and guarded by  0  five large chariots one after the other drawn by elephants and guarded by  0 men  two ditto drawn by horses richly caparisoned alike guarded  two thousand mandarins of letters  two thousand mandarins of arms  european sovereigns have been attended by many thousands of persons but never by  000 literati among the number  chinese horses are not only beautiful but their harness is magnificent the bits and the stirrups being either silver or gilt the saddle is very rich and the reins are made of stitched satin two fingers broad from the upper part of the chest hang two large tufts of fine red hair such as their caps are covered with and these tufts are suspended by iron rings gilt or silvered when the grandees ride out they are always preceded and followed by a great number of horsemen who form their retinue without reckoning their domestics and who according to the quality of their masters are clothed in black satin or dyed callico  their chairs are a kind of sedan like ours made of bamboo but have no glass those in which the ladies are carried are always provided with a lattice or blind to prevent their seeing or being seen a piece of wood is placed across from the end of one pole to the other which the chairmen lay upon their shoulders their carriages are something like our jockycarts drawn by two or more horses abreast and conducted by a driver on foot except when they travel expeditiously in which case the driver rides in the carriage and conducts the horses with reins the carriage being wide enough to hold two these carriages have only two wheels some but one in the center underneath are open with an umbrella fixed behind but those in which ladies are carried are covered and close shut with latticedoors in front and a curtain to drop down before them when they please see the plate chinese  if a mandarine travels by water they are furnished with barks at the emperors expense these are equal in size to a thirdrate man of war and beautiful in the extreme being painted and gilt and japanned within and without barks most in use are about    feet broad    long and nine in depth from the neck  besides the masters cabin who has his family with him a kitchen two large rooms one before and the other behind there is a hall about six or seven feet high and eleven broad also an antichamber and two or three other rooms for the mandarin all on the same deck the inside is japanned red and white with plenty of carved work paintings and gildings on the cieling and sides the tables and chairs are japanned red and black the deck is surrounded with galleries so that the sailors can pass and repass without incommoding the passengers this apartment is covered with a platform or terrace open on all sides set apart for music underneath is the hold for the baggage sails etc  the bark that carries the chief mandarin is always followed by others among which is one laden with provisions this carries the kitchen the eatables and the cooks another is full of soldiers and a third lighter than the rest is dispatched before to clear the way and prepare things where they are to stop these barks have a certain number of rowers relieved by others at the distance of every league are from five to ten sentinels placed so that if there is occasion signals can be given from one to another by fires or pieces of artillery these soldiers stand all of a row on the bank as the mandarin passes one of them bears an ensign displayed the others are under arms  every time they cast anchor as they do in the evening or when they leave it in the morning the corpse de guard salutes the mandarin with a discharge of great guns to which the trumpets reply with several flourishes at night lantherns are lighted at the head and stern and the mast is strung with them when these are lighted the captain of the guard on shore stands with his company opposite the bark and having saluted the mandarin retires leaving a sentinel who rattles a pair of bamboo castinets all night to declare he is still on the watch this sentinel is relieved hourly  chap vii their way of traveling having spoken of their traveling by canals it remains only to speak of their roads etc  the security of travelers and an easy mode of conveyance for passengers and merchandise are objects to which the chinese have paid particular attention and the manner in which the public roads are managed greatly contribute to the former  like the romans heretofore they throw up highways from one end of the kingdom to the other through the low grounds they raise causeways to a great height and in some places pave them cut passages through rocks and mountains to make the ways as level as possible and shorten the distance the high road cut out across the mountains to singanfou the capital of chensi is the most remarkable thing in this country the road was made by an army in the course of a military expedition mountains are levelled and bridges constructed reaching from one mountain to another and where the valleys are very wide large pillars are erected to support these bridges which in some places are so exceedingly high that a traveller cannot look down from them without terror they are wide enough for four horsemen to ride abreast and are railed in on each side villages and inns for the accommodation of passengers have been built at certain distances on the road  on the side of some mountains which are perpendicular and have no shelving they have fixed large beams in them and on these beams have made a sort of balcony without rails those who are not used to them travel over them with great fear but the people of the place pass them without concern  the roads in general are very broad    or    yards and in all the southern provinces paved but on the paved ways no horse or carriage passes they are for the most part bordered with very lofty trees and sometimes with walls eight or ten feet high to keep people out of the grounds on all the great roads covered seats are erected at proper intervals where a traveller may shelter himself from the inclemency of the weather and excessive heat or cold temples and pagodas are also frequently to be met with to which admittance is always granted in the daytime mandarins may continue in them as long as they please are there received with marks of distinction served with attention and are lodged they and their whole retinue upon the road says mr bell from the city of siangfou are many turrets called posthouses erected at certain distances with a flagstaff on each on which is hoisted the imperial pendant these places are guarded by soldiers who run from post to post with letters that concern the emperor with great speed as these turrets are within sight of each other any intelligence may be speedily conveyed it is thus the court is quickly apprized of any disturbance in the remotest places these turrets or towers are square brick buildings about    feet high on the tops of which are watchboxes and sentinels on the roads that conduct to court for they are general on all roads they are provided with large castiron bells the stated distance by law between tower and tower is half a french league so that the roads are well guarded from robbers  every man who goes by armed is obliged to give an account whence he came where he is going on what business and must show his pass  administration have been at great pains to publish an itinerary of the whole chinese empire this book which is a directory for all travelers takes in every road and canal from the city of peking to the remotest extremities of china  posthouses have been here established but they are not public the couriers of the empire only have a right to use them and officers dispatched by the court who are always attended by a guard but excepting regular posts travelers find no difficulty of getting their baggage transported from one place to another in every city there are a great number of porters associated under a common chief who regulates their prices and all their agreements he receives their pay and is responsible for all they carry when porters are wanted and porters carry every thing he furnishes as many as are necessary gives the same number of tickets to the traveller who returns one to each porter when he has delivered his load and the porter with this ticket receives his pay of his chief who has the money in advance  this establishment is settled by the general police of the empire on all the great roads the traveller finds in every city from which he is setting out several offices of this kind who have a correspondence with the next he is to pass before his departure he carries to one of these offices a list of such things as he wishes to be conveyed which is immediately entered in a book and if he has occasion for two or three hundred he is immediately furnished every thing is weighed by their chief and their price is five pence english for one days carriage an exact register is kept in the office the traveller pays the money in advance and on his arrival at the next office he finds his baggage carefully delivered  every mile and a half wooden buildings like triumphal arches about  0 feet high with three doors over which is wrote upon a large frize in characters so large as may be read at a quarter of a mile distant how far it is from the town you left and how far to the town you are going to so that there is no need of guides  it is the police also which regulates the customhouses for every thing here is on the emperors account chinese customhouseofficers are perhaps the civilest in the world they have no concern but with merchants whom they do not oppress by rigorous exactions travelers are not stoped here as in other countries till their baggage is examined though the officers are authorized so to do nor is the smallest see required  as to the conveyance of letters the royal postmaster for a little money will favor the public and carry letters from private persons at as little expense and with as much expedition as in europe  as it is a matter of importance that the emperors orders be quickly transmitted so is it great part of a mandarins care to see that the roads be good and the emperor who often travels about the country to keep the mandarins to this duty spreading a report that he means shortly to visit this or that province the governors of those provinces knowing this spare neither charge nor pains to repair the roads as not only their fortunes but sometimes their lives are at stake upon the state of them  a governor once hanged himself through despair lest he should not have time enough to repair the roads through which he expected the emperor to pass to the capital city yet the emperor never went the journey but all their care will not keep them in very good order the soil is so light and being much beaten by travelers the surface of them is ground so fine that they are blown away by brisk winds and the traveller is often obliged to wear a mask before his eyes through clouds of dust he is frequently compelled to make his way and swallow the sand instead of air so that in hot weather and the wind in his face scarce any but a native can withstand it  chap viii of the genius and temper of the people the chinese have ever considered themselves as something superior to the rest of mankind till the europeans arrived among them and to this day though their ignorance is so notorious in the speculative sciences and even in some mechanical arts as for instance in clockwork architecture and some others they will have it that they have one eye more than us  but exclusive of their own overweening opinion of themselves they are possessed generally of a great many good qualities though they have some bad ones they are a mild and affable people polite even to excess circumspect in all their actions weighing the consequences of things before they attempt to carry them into execution but more careful not to expose their prudence than to preserve their reputation  politeness is with them a principle of morality and no sort of men are excused from it tradesmen servants even countrymen nay footmen will take their leave of each other on their knees and farmers in their entertainments use more compliments than we do even seamen who from their manner of living and from the air they breathe draw in a natural roughness treat one another like brothers and pay each other that deference that one would think them united in the strictest bonds of friendship  very much propossessed with an opinion of their own importance they are not sensible of their defects and from entertaining too high ideas of their own knowledge they shut their eyes and run against instructions from others though suspicious of strangers they are eager to take advantage of them and notwithstanding their boasted politeness and the equitable rules they pretend to be governed by injustice is too often found in their courts and much of the time both of princes and people taken up as in europe with amorous intrigues but they use such caution to conceal their vices that a stranger would be apt to suppose every thing was well regulated  though the chinese are so jealous as not to suffer their wives to speak in private even to their own brothers much less indulge them with the enjoyment of that freedom and those public amusements which in europe is considered as gallantry and innocent pleasure yet there are husbands who will be so complaisant as to let their wives freely commit adultery and which permission some women make a condition in their marriagearticles those who according to such agreement submit to this practice as there are a certain sort of people that do have no power to hinder debauchees from frequenting their houses and from making an ill use of the easiness or unruly passions of their wives but such families are abhorred by the chinese who think so ill of them that their children though never so deserving or intelligent can never obtain any degree or be employed in any honorable office  they continually apply themselves to discover the inclinations humors and tempers of those they have any commerce with and keep up a fair correspondence even with their greatest enemies when they have an interest to manage no people know better how to insinuate themselves into the good opinion of others or improve an opportunity when it offers to greater advantage nor will they decline the most hazardous undertaking when they have any gain in view trade and commerce says le compte seem to be the soul of this people and the spring of all their actions nor do they much scruple imposing on those they deal with of which many of them are so far from being ashamed that they will laugh at him whom they have bubbled a foreigner is in great danger of being cheated if he trusts to his own judgment and if he employs a chinese factor as is usual both factor and merchant will combine to deceive him if the chinese would accompany labor and natural industry with a little more honesty they would be complete merchants but they seldom fail to cheat whenever it is in their power and falsify almost every thing they sell hogs are sold alive by weight and prior to their being weighed they will make holes in their hide beneath their bellies and thrust in flat pieces of lead to increase their weight and they counterfeit gammons of bacon so artfully that people are often taken in and when they have boiled them a long time shall find nothing when they sit down to eat but a piece of wood under a hogs skin  their subtlety in deception is still more extraordinary in their thieves and robbers who will break through the thickest walls burn gates and make great holes in them by means of a certain engine that fires the wood without any flame thus will they penetrate into the most private recesses and having with them a certain drug the fume of which stupefies the senses and casts persons into a deep sleep will enter the very bedchambers unperceived and when the people awake in the morning they are surprised to find their bed without curtains their chamber unfurnished and the tables cabinets coffers and every thing removed without any traces of the thieves but the hole in the wall through which they entered and carried off the effects  but with all their dishonesty there do not want instances of fairdealing and open generous usage with a fidelity not to be corrupted  among their ill qualities they are naturally litigious and in china as well as in some other countries a man may if he pleases ruin himself by going to law great crimes are very uncommon among the chinese but vices frequent and the misfortune is this the law neither searches after nor punishes them but when they offend against and violate public decency  a chinese is vindictive but he studies to seek revenge not by violent means or by duelling which is prohibited but by craftiness or stratagem and consequently with impunity their revenge is secretly taken and they will not only dissemble their malice but seem patient even to insensibility till they have a favorable opportunity to strike home for however the chinese may excel in cunning their courage is not very remarkable  but the tartars who since their conquest of china have mixed with the chinese and are of a very different stamp though they adopted its customs they have still retained their original character are obligingly liberal an enemy to every kind of dissimulation and more desirous of enjoying their fortune than increasing it in all business of the state a tartar discovers a penetration that lessens the difficulty of what he undertakes and in affairs of smaller moment he displays that expeditious activity which may be justly called the soul of business in short they are superior to the chinese in almost every thing  in giving this general character of the chinese we have had an eye principally to the inhabitants of towns in rural life there is far more openness of temper benevolence and friendship a chinese peasant often discovers moral qualities which would add luster to the character of more exalted rank however it must on the whole he admitted that china has produced great men of every kind and taken from all classes altogether the people as at present are to every other nation on earth the most curious monument that has been handed down to us from the remotest antiquity  there is one virtue however peculiar to this country in its universality and height to which it is carried that must not be omitted when we are speaking of their natural disposition i mean their piety to their parents and it is a subject that must give every rational reader some pleasure to dwell on and almost atones for every other defect it is inconceivable to what a degree of perfection this first principle of nature is here improved there is no submission no point of obedience which a parent cannot command or which a child can refuse they have such a love such an obedience such a veneration for their parents that neither the severity of their treatment the impertinence of old age or the meanness of their situation even when their children have met with preferment can ever efface  filial piety is so much honored and respected in china that no instance is known of a legislators having been under the necessity of enforcing it by law it is not only considered as a natural duty but a point of religion and a point that is observed with the greatest strictness and attention this duty seems to be the mainspring and principal cause of the existence of chinese government as the amor patriae or love of ones country was the basis of the ancient republics filial piety in this empire is understood in a more extensive sense than it generally is in europe it is chief object here is that subjects should behave to their sovereign as children and the sovereign protect his subject as the common father of the nation  they have a kind of written code respecting the duty of a child the precepts of which have acquired the force of laws i will select some few passages from it  a son must honor his parents without any regard to their bad qualities he must hide their faults and conceal even his own knowledge of their defects he is at liberty however to remonstrate with them on their conduct three times if he thinks it necessary but if his admonitions are rejected or not attended he is to remain silent venting his grief only in silence and is to continue to serve them with the same respect and attention as before  a son must never quarrel with his father or an old friend  he never speaks of infirmities or old age in the presence of the authors of his existence  he never goes abroad without acquainting his father nor ever enters the house without going to salute him  he quits every engagement and without the least delay obeys the voice of his father when he calls  an ingenious youth equally avoids whatever may conceal or expose his talents because his reputation is not his own but belongs to his parents  a son possesses no property of his own during the life of his parents he cannot even expose his life to save that of a friend  a son ought not to sit any where on the same seat with his father and when with his parents listens always to them when they address him and sees them without being in their presence  a welldisposed youth never visits the friend of his father but when invited never retires till he obtains permission and speaks only when he is spoken to  when a parent meets with any cause of discontent or sorrow a son neither pays nor receives visits is either of them sick his concern appears in the negligence of his dress the sadness of his looks and his embarrassment in speaking  a son who has lost his father and mother ever after renounces brilliancy of dress and abstains from wearing gaudy colors his mourning is long and rigid and part of it consists in fasting  the emperor on the death of his father mourns three years and never takes the helm of government in his hands till the expiration of that time public business is conducted by a regency the observance of this virtue is strongly inculcated in all the public schools and is that part of education first taught the laws have also regulated with the greatest precision the relative obligations between children and parents husbands and wives uncles and nephews etc restraining on the one hand by gentle chastisement and encouraging on the other by flattering rewards the father has the merit of every good action which the son performs and the emperor grants only to fathers whether living or dead those marks of distinction which their sons have merited  nothing being more strictly enjoined by the laws than submission and obedience to parents if a father charges his son with any crime before a magistrate the son is supposed to be guilty and if the offense is capital shall lose his life without any other evidence their reasoning upon this matter is as follows who is better acquainted with a sons merits or demerits than his father who has brought him up and for a long time observed all his actions can any person have a greater love or a more sincere affection for him if therefore he who knows his case exactly and loves him tenderly condemns him how can a judge pronounce him innocent and guiltless and when it has been objected to them that some persons have an inbred dislike to others and that fathers who are men an well as fathers are capable of such antipathies against their children they answer that men are not more unnatural than savage beasts the cruellest of which never destroy their young through caprice but even supposing there were such monsters among men it is the part of children by their modest deportment and sweetness of temper to tame and to soften them in short say they the love of their children is so deeply imprinted in the hearts of parents that antipathy or dislike can never erase it unless provoked and enflamed by undutifulness stubbornness ingratitude and disorderly con of their children in which case they are not fit to live  if a son shall presume to lay violent hands on a parent  them the whole country is alarmed and the judgment reserved for the emperor himself the magistrates of the place are turned out of office and all the neighborhood threatened as having given countenance to so infernal a temper as a man could never have arrived they think at such a degree of wretchedness at once but must have discovered his disposition on other occasions which they should have taken care to correct the criminal in these cases is sentenced to be cut into  0000 pieces and afterward burnt his houses and lands destroyed and even the houses that stood near to his are erased to remain as monuments of so detestable a crime  even the emperors themselves cannot reject the authority of their parents without running the risk of suffering for it and their history relates a story which will always make the affection which the chinese have for this duty appear amiable one of their emperors had a mother who carried on a private intrigue with a nobleman of his court and the public notice that was taken of it obliged him both for her own honor and that of the empire to show his resentment of it so that he banished her into a far distant province and because he knew that his conduct in so doing would not be very acceptable to his princes and mandarins he forbad them all on pain of death to give him any advice upon the subject they were all silent for some time hoping that he would of himself see his own error and recall her but not doing it rather than suffer so pernicious a precedent they resolved to interfere in it  the first who had the courage to put up a request to the emperor in this affair was instantly put to death on the spot this did not check the mandarins proceedings for a day or two after another made a second attempt and to show the world that he was willing to sacrifice his life for the public good ordered his hearse to stand at the palacegate the emperor rather than affected at this noble action was the more provoked he not only sentenced this man to die but to terrify all others from following his example ordered him to be put to the torture one would not surely have thought it prudent to hold out any longer but the chinese were of another way of thinking for they resolved to fall one after another rather than basely pass over in silence so bad an action  a third therefore stood forth and devoted himself he like the second ordered his coffin to be set at the palacegate and protested to the emperor that he could not any longer see him persist in his crime without remonstrating what shall we lose by our death says he but the sight of a prince on whom we cannot look without amazement and horror since you will not hear us we will go and seek out your ancestors and those of the empress your mother they will hear our complaints and perhaps in the darkness and silence of the night you may hear our ghosts and theirs reproach you for your injustice  the emperor more enraged than ever at this insolence as he called it of his subjects inflicted on this last man the severest torments he could devise many others encouraged by these examples exposed themselves to torment and did in effect die martyrs to filial duty at last this heroic constancy wearied out the emperors cruelty and whether he was afraid of more dangerous consequences or stood selfcondemned as the father of his people he repented of having put any of his children to death and as the son of the empress was troubled that he had so long misused his mother he therefore recalled her restored her to her former dignities and after this the more he honored her the more was he himself honored by his subjects  filial duty commences in families and rises step by step to the sovereign the common father who surpasses even the meanest of his subjects either in that kind of reverence which is due to ancestors or in his conduct to the empressmother if she survives her husband no mother living of whatever rank is so highly honored and so publicly respected by a son  on the first day of every year acknowledgments of duty and respect are renewed in every family and also in the emperors as soon as the sun rises all the mandarins of the different tribunals repair to the palace dressed in their official robes and the royal family and household with distinguished badges appear in their places the emperor thus situated and accompanied leaves his chamber to pay his respects to his mother in an adjoining apartment he is carried there in his chair of state but quits it at the entrance of his mothers vestibule preceded by a mandarin the president of the tribunal of ceremonies who on entering her hall of audience throws himself on his knees and presents a petition from the emperor requesting her imperial majesty to receive on her throne the humble marks of duty and affection which he is about to pay her the mandarineunuch carries it to the empress in her inward apartment and she comes forth dressed in a habit of ceremony followed by her whole court and ascends her throne the emperor and his suite then approach to the sound of soft and tender music and a mandarin cries out kneel immediately the emperor princes and all the mandarins fall on their knees and on the mandarins crying out prostrate yourselves throw themselves on their faces after nine prostrations all by word of command the mandarin cries rise up and they all rise and stand erect this done a petition is presented to the emperor from his mother requesting him to return to his own apartments the music again plays and the emperor departs in the same manner he came he is then followed in this ceremony by the reigning empress and all the princesses and ladies of the imperial family who prostrate themselves before the empressmother as he has done the emperor on his return to his own hall of audience receives the compliments of the nobility  besides this public ceremony on new years day the emperor is obliged to visit his mother every five days all his life and an emperor newly proclaimed cannot receive the homage of his grandees at court till he has first paid his respects to his mother he never takes a wife without her consent never bestows any principalities on her children or grants any favors to his people without first consulting her in short it is held that the filial piety of the prince doubles all the virtues of his subjects that all villainy begins by disobedience to parents that every virtue is in danger when filial piety is attacked that to praise a son is to boast to blame a parent is to throw a stain upon ones self and every thing which tends to promote filial piety is a pillar to the state and every thing that wounds it a public calamity  chap ix of their marriages education and funerals though the chinese in some particulars bear an affinity with other nations yet in their manners and customs they differ from every known country in europe if mutual consent is necessary to constitute a marriage there is no such thing as marriage in china the parties never see each other till the bargain is concluded by the parents and that is commonly when they are children nor is the womans consent even demanded afterward girls may well be reckoned part of their fathers treasure since the poorest man must purchase his wife and no fortune is given with her  when the tartars in the late war took nanking there happened a circumstance which diverted the chinese notwithstanding all their misfortunes among the disorders which the victors committed in that province they endeavored to seize on all the women they could to make money of and when they took the chief city of that province they carried all the women there and shut them up together in the magazines with other goods but as there were some of all ages and degrees of beauty they resolved to put them into sacks and carry them to market and so sell them to any one at a venture ugly or handsome there was the same price set upon every one and for    or    shillings take which you would without opening it after this manner the soldiers who were ever insolent in prosperity showed themselves more barbarous in the most polite city in the world than they had been in the deserts of tartary  on the day of sale there came buyers enough some came to recover if happily they could their wives or children who were among these women others were led there through hopes that good luck would put a fortune into their hands in short the novelty of the thing brought a great concourse from the adjacent places an ordinary fellow who had but   s in the world gave it chose a sack as did the rest and carried it off when he was out of the crowd whether through curiosity or a desire to relieve the person in the sack who complained he could not forbear opening it in it he found an old woman whom age grief and illtreatment had deformed to the highest degree he was so confoundedly mad at it that to gratify his passion and rage he was going to throw the old woman and sack together into the river when the good old gentlewoman said to him son your lot is not so bad as you imagine be of good cheer you have made your fortune take care only of my life and i will make yours happier than ever it has been yet these words somewhat pacified him and he carried her to a house hard by where she made him acquainted with her quality and her estate she belonged to a mandarin of note in the neighborhood to whom she immmediately wrote he sent her an equipage agreeable to her quality and carried her deliverer along with her and afterward was so good a friend to him that he had never reason to complain of the loss of the two crowns he had laid out in the purchase of her  the same matrons that negotiate a marriage determine the sum that is to be paid for the bride and if such negotiators deceive the bridegroom in their accounts respecting the figure and personal qualities of the lady he is at liberty to refuse her on losing the purchasemoney or paying a second sum equal to it  the calendar is always consulted for a lucky day to solemnize the nuptials and in the intermediate time letters pass between the young couple presents are sent to and from the two families and the bridegroom purchases some jewels for his bride but the parties never see each other on the day of marriage the bride is locked in a close sedan or close palanquin which last is a kind of couch covered with cushions and a tester and carried by poles on mens shoulders if in a sedan the key is committed to the care of a trusty domestic who is to deliver it to the bridegroom and she is carried to his house preceded by a troop of musicians with fifes drums and hautboys and followed by her family every thing that composes her portion is borne before and behind her by different persons of both sexes whilst others surround her carrying lighted torches and flambeaux the bridegroom richly dressed waits her arrival at his gate the key is given him and as soon as she approaches he eagerly opens the chair if he is pleased with his bargain he receives her with great joy if not he sometimes suddenly shuts to the chair and returns her to her parents the poor woman has no alternative whether she likes her husband or not if he likes her she must continue with him if not must go back but if the bridegroom once receives her the marriage is irrevocable  on quitting her chair and entering the house she is followed by both their relations and the newmarried couple salute the god tien in the hall four times and afterward the parents of the bridegroom the bride is then introduced to the women invited to the wedding and with them partakes of an entertainment that ends only with the day the men are alike entertained by the husband for in all chinese feasts men and women never eat and drink together but the one sex always apart from the other  the procession and entertainments are always in proportion to the rank of the parties some are attended with more pomp than others but all make the best appearance they can  a chinese can only have one lawful wife and this wife must be nearly of his own rank and age but he may purchase as many concubines as he pleases and receive them into his house provided he enters into a contract to treat their daughters well these concubines or wives of second rank are totally dependant on the lawful spouse and are expected to be always obedient to her orders their children are considered as hers and they address her only as mother indeed she is given to understand that her husband hiring concubines is merely to procure her a number of women to attend her agreeable to the nations of antiquity who established this custom in favor of population some husbands desirous of male issue which perhaps they have not by their wives will take a concubine from this motive only and dismiss her when their wishes are accomplished giving this concubine a permission to marry and often procuring a husband for her themselves  when le compte observed to them the jealousy and uneasiness a plurality of wives must needs occasion they replied there was nothing but what had some inconveniences attending it and they did not know but a man might have more vexation with one than with many where there are several some of them might probably be in humor when others were out of temper but where a man is confined to one there is no relief if she proves sullen or noisy  on the death of the lawful wife the concubines and their children mourn for her three years and the husband will then raise his favorite of these women to the rank of lawful wife on which occasions age and rank is dispensed with and all the ceremony i have before menmentioned the children of concubines have however a right to share with the children of the lawful wife in their paternal succession  these concubines are almost all procured from the cities of yangtcheou and soutcheou where girls receive the first of educations and are taught singing dancing music and every other accomplishment that can render them pleasing and agreeable many are here purchased to be again disposed of indeed this is the chief trade carried on in these two cities the law of china permitted no person to keep concubines but the emperor the princes of the blood and the mandarins the monarch being allowed two and each of the others one but custom has broken through this law the emperor has a seraglio of more than  00 many of the nobles have numerous collections of women and every other man as many as he pleases or can afford  as wives there are obtained only by purchase men of the lower class and not in opulent circumstances are forced to content themselves with one and in this respect the poor women in china have much the advantage of the rich what would a lady give to exchange condition with a cottager and have a whole man to herself for men of fortune will have a seraglio of an hundred if their circumstances will admit of it where these wretched creatures are perpetually confined and scarcely allowed to breathe the fresh air they never see any other man than their keeper or are seen by any while poor women the wives of cottagers range about at liberty and enjoy the use of their feet in a double sense not being made cripples from their cradles as their betters have the honor to be by bandages  in all seraglios she who is brought to bed first has the preference of the rest and till a woman has had a child she is not suffered to sit down at the table with the rest of the family but must wait upon them next to being barren the greatest scandal is to bring females into the world and if a woman happens to have three or four girls together without a boy she will expose or strangle them with her own hands and whenever the parents are poor and unfortunate they consider it as an act of piety to remove an infant from a miserable existence this is the reason so many children are exposed in the streets and highways whose parents possibly have so much tenderness remaining that notwithstanding a prevailing custom they cannot see them die much less butcher them with their own hands  a widower or a widow may marry a second time when neither age or rank are necessary conditions but a widow of rank with children being absolute mistress of herself seldom marries again those of ordinary rank do but those of the poorer sort are generally sold for the benefit of their husbands parents and as soon as the bargain is concluded a couple of cowlies or porters bring a chair which is locked up and guarded by a number of trusty people and the widow is thus conducted to the house of her new husband widows with child and the mothers of a son those whom their own friends will maintain and who will become priestesses are exempt from this compulsion  marriage is here held in such esteem that a poor man who cannot afford to purchase a wife will sell himself for a slave on condition that he shall be permitted to marry a female slave in the family most men marry by the time they are twenty years of age an old bachelor is looked on with contempt and the chinese in general consider it as an unfortunate situation to leave no children to mourn over their graves there is scarce a single man to be found in the country and the women being exceedingly prolific it is no wonder the country is so populous especially as few of them travel out of it and there is seldom war or pestilence to take them off  it may be matter of wonder that in a country where every man marries and the rich have many women ten or a dozen each how a sufficient number of females are found for them considering it is admitted that as many are born of the one sex as the other but when it is considered that the poor who make up the bulk of the nation have but one wife each and that as the men live single till twenty and the women are marriageable at twelve all the females between twelve and twenty are supernumeraries and may serve to fill the seraglios of the great they make it a rule never to marry one of the same name but degrees of kindred are not much attended to on the mothers side two brothers however cannot marry two sisters as with us nor can the children of a widow and a widower marry together nor a man any of his own relations however distant nor can young folks marry whilst in mourning for their parents nor can the daughter of a free man marry her slave  as in all other ancient nations divorces are granted in china but with less facility they are only admitted here in cases of adultery mutual dislike incompatibility of tempers and dispositions indiscretion jealousy absolute disobedience barrenness or hereditary and infectious diseases no husband can repudiate a wife till a divorce is legally obtained if a wife elopes from her husband he can sue out a process and obtain a sentence to sell the fugitive who then ceases to be his wife and becomes his slave the law also protects wives deserted by their husbands if he absents himself for three years she then lays her case before a tribunal and will be authorized to marry again but she would be punished if she acted so without the authority of a court  persons of quality generally give their daughters two or three female slaves when they marry to attend her home to her husband and so sacred is the wifes apartment that even her husbands father is never permitted to enter it and if the father would punish the son for any offense as he is at liberty to do even after marriage should he get into his wifes apartment he is as safe as in a sanctuary  every father of a family is responsible for the conduct of his children and his servants all those faults being imputed to him which it was his duty to prevent a law full of wisdom in a country where fathers and masters exercise so great an authority over their children and slaves  no mother in china can make a will adoption of children is authorized by law and the adopted child assumes the fathers name and enjoys all the rights of a legal son every father has a right to sell his son if the son has a right to sell himself as a son in china is not allowed to have more power over his own person than his father has but a father cannot sell his son to a comedian whose profession is held contemptible in short a son during the life of his father is always a minor and a son is liable to pay his fathers debts if not incurred by gaming  fathers fearful of not being able to provide for their sons will sometimes make them eunuchs and this renders them capable of serving in the seraglios they are called gelubden and no other are suffered to approach the women  slavery is authorized in china but the master has no power to debauch the wife of a slave he would be punished with death if he did though slaves are so for life it frequently happens that they gain their liberty and some have the command of what they earn and at liberty to earn it where they please on paying their masters annually a certain sum if some of them grow rich by their industry the master will not strip them of their property but be satisfied with large presents he will not however consent to their redemption at any price  masters are anxious to promote marriage among their slaves as children born in slavery are the property of such masters and constitute a fresh tie that attach their parents to their service  chinese women even of the greatest rank seldom quit their apartments which are generally situated in the most retired part of the house and here they are secluded from all society but their domestics employ themselves in painting and needle work but never meddle with trade and have birds dogs and other animals to divert them if daughters are not married in their fathers lifetime brothers are obliged to support them a wife says the book of ceremonies is not mistress of herself she has nothing at her own disposal she can give no orders but in her own apartment and here all her authority is confined  every man has three names a surname common to the family a proper name and a name he receives on entering any new employ which is called his greatname if he should enter any new sect the doctor who introduces him bestows a fourth name upon him as for daughters they retain their fathers surname only and are distinguished according to the order of their birth as first second third etc and do not change their names on marriage  in the education of their children they begin very early the wealthy never appoint any woman to be a nurse that is not modest in her deportment and manner that does not adhere strictly to truth that talks much that has not a mild temper and does not behave with affability to her equals and respect to her superiors the manner of education of the chinese make such nurses not uncommon  as soon as a child can put its hand to its mouth it is weaned and taught to use its right hand at six years of age if a boy he is made acquainted with numbers and the names of most places in the world at seven separated from his sisters and taken out of the nursery at eight he is instructed in the rules of politeness and learns the calendar at nine sent to school at ten to learn reading writing and accounts from thirteen to fifteen he is taught music and all his songs are moral precepts at fifteen they learn to ride and use the bow at twenty they receive the cap of manhood and are permitted to wear silk and fur whereas before this time they could wear only cottons  europeans can scarcely conceive how far the sovereigns of china have carried their attention in order to promote and encourage letters in every city in every town and in almost every village there are schoolmasters in order to teach the sciences as far as they are able opulent parents provide preceptors for their children to teach them virtue politeness history and a knowledge of their laws many of these preceptors are for their knowledge afterward ennobled and a pupil is not astonished to see his preceptor become his viceroy  when boys are brought forward in learning they perform public exercises and have public examinations in noble buildings erected for the purpose where every thing is conducted without the least force as in our universities and those that have made a sufficient progress have honorary rewards the mandarins of letters will condescend to examine them and the governors of cities will bestow prizes on those who best deserve them  we shall say very little of the education of girls they are accustomed to modesty and silence and to a taste for solitude if their parents are rich they are taught every female accomplishment the duties however of women in china as in other asiatic countries are of the passive kind  the funeral rites of the chinese are considered as the most important of all their ceremonies and persons receive more honor and homage on the day of their deaths than ever they did whilst alive persons of any distinction cause their coffins to be made in their lifetime and those of the higher rank cause their tombs to be built each family as with us having a particular buryingplace those of the common people are in cemeteries without the city there being none allowed within the walls these coffins are commonly varnished and sometimes carved and gilt are made of durable wood and upwards of six inches thick  rich people frequently lay out a thousand crowns on a coffin of precious wood inlaid and ornamented with different colors those who are not worth above twenty crowns will often expend the greatest part of it this way in cases of poverty and when all other means fail a son will often sell himself and become a slave to purchase his father a coffin which perhaps shall remain  0 years useless in the family but is considered by the head of it as the most valuable piece of furniture in his possession  when a man of fortune dies his nearest relation informs his friends of it they assemble wash and perfume the corpse and dress it in the best clothes he used to wear then placing the dead body in a chair the wives first then the children and afterward the relations and friends of the deceased prostrate themselves before the corpse and passionately bewail their loss the third day the body is put into the coffin laid on a layer of lime laid over with cotton covered with a piece of silk and placed in the middle of the hall hung with white linen with some pieces of black or violetcolour interspersed having a table set before it with a picture or effigy of the deceased upon it the relations are then again introduced and with waxlights burning and incense pay their homage to the coffin and accompany their respects with lamentations in the mean time all the sons of the deceased clothed in linen and girt with a cord stand on one side of the coffin in a mournful posture whilst the mother and daughters stand on the other side behind a curtain lamenting in such strains as custom requires the attendant guests all the time chanting mournful songs during the days that the corpse is thus kept there are tables well covered every morning with sweetmeats and tea the priest is the butler the persons who come to pay their respects to the deceased are ushered in and out by a relation appointed for the purpose a large sheet of paper is hung over the gate expressing the name and quality of the deceased and giving a short detail of his life and great actions the corpse is sometimes kept in this state for months and all the sons of the deceased sleep on mats or places round about his coffin they taste neither flesh nor strong drink nor come near their wives all this time all the visits made to the deceased are afterward returned by the eldest son the custom is not to be at home when he calls and cards are left  on the day of burial the relations are again assembled and most of them attend and follow the corpse to the grave and the procession is as follows a number of men one before the other march in file carrying images of men and women slaves elephants lions and other animals painted on pasteboard in order to be burnt at the grave next proceed figures of triumphal chariots castles flags and censors filled with perfumes supported by men two and two followed by tables of sweetmeats etc after which follow the priests in their robes with drums music and bells playing plaintive and melancholy airs immediately after the music follows the coffin carried by  0 or  0 men under a canopy formed like a dome composed of violetcoloured silk its four corners ornamented with tufts of white silk neatly embroidered and covered with network next walks the eldest son clothed in a canvas frock with his body bent and leaning on a staff behind him his brother two and two leaning on crutches as if not able to support themselves and the whole procession closed with the mothers and daughters carried in close chairs covered with white silk or linen and all the relations and friends of the deceased in mourning who with the ladies shut up deafen the air with their continual howlings to which are added often a number of women on foot hired purposely to howl  at the buryingplace they find several temporary halls erected and lined with tables covered with provisions and served up with great splendour as a regale for the mourners and attendants if the deceased is a grandee of the empire his relations never leave the tomb for a month or two but reside in apartments purposely prepared for them and renew their marks of homage daily these funerals are more and more pompous in proportion to the rank and wealth of the deceased in the procession of the emperors elder brother there were more than   000 people all of whom had particular offices assigned them in the ceremony  mountains and solitary places far from town are chosen for the tombs and sepulchers of the great some of which are very magnificent if a tomb is erected in a valley or plain a vast heap of earth is raised over it as a tumulus and covered with white plaster so that no wet can penetrate the tomb below being an arched vault in the vault an altar is erected lights placed on it meats and incense offered on it and the pictures of the men and animals burnt which they conceive will be converted into the things they represent and will be of service to the dead in another state and if the deceased has held any considerable office his virtues and illustrious actions real chinese sepulcher or imaginary are engraved on marble and fixed up in the front of the tomb with a number of figures representing officers eunuchs soldiers saddled horses camels lions and tortoises ranged round in different rows and groves of aged cypresses planted chequerwise which have never felt three stroke of the axe preserve an awful and melancholy gloom about them  an appearance more calculated to make a deep impression on the multitude than the costly deccorations of our funeral monuments in europe the poor are contented with placing the coffin under a shed and covering it with a roof of thatch  some of the chinese have carried their filial attachment so far as to preserve in their houses the bodies of their deceased fathers for three or four years and they have all in general such a veneration for the buryingplaces of their ancestors that neither curiosity nor the love of gain can allure them to travel into remote parts of the world they have a bad opinion of foreigners on this very account and even despise their own countrymen who from necessity or for the sake of trade go to sunda or other islands to reside because they imagine they must leave their bones in unhallowed ground it is little wonder therefore that the chinese are so seldom to be met with in very distant nations  each family of distinction has a large building called the hall of ancestors erected on some part of their estates common for all the branches of the family and destined for the following purpose in this hall a long table is set against the wall on which is painted or the effigy fixed up of one of their ancestors who has filled some office under government with honor to himself or rendered himself illustrious by his talents sometimes it contains only the names of men women and children belonging to the family with their ages day of their deaths and dignities inscribed upon tablets ranged in two rows on steps about a foot high  in spring the relations assemble in this hall the two wealthiest of which prepare at their own expense an entertainment for the rest this entertainment like the feasts at tartar graves were originally designed for the dead for they never touch a bit of any thing till an offering has been made to them but their annual festivals at this hall does not free the chinese from the obligation of visiting the real graves or tombs of their ancestors once or twice a year when they repair to these places they begin by plucking up the weeds and bushes that surround the sepulcher and conclude by placing wine and provisions upon the tomb which serve to dine their assistants the poor who have no hall to honor the manes of their ancestors are satisfied with placing up the names of their deceased relations in the most open parts of their houses if the emperor happens to meet a funeral procession when he goes abroad he never fails to send some of his attendants to condole with the relations of the deceased such are the marks of honor which the chinese pay their ancestors perhaps the simple dictates of nature supported by custom but now established into a law which cannot be broken with impunity  chap x of their trade and manufactures the commerce carried on within the country of china is so great that the trade of all europe is not equal to it the provinces are like so many kingdoms trading with each other so that plenty reigns throughout the whole one furnishes rice another silk another imports ink and curious works of all kinds another iron copper and other metals horses mules furs and another sugars and the best teas another plants medicinal herbs rhubarb etc and so of the rest for it would be endless to run through minutely the particular riches of each province  the great number of canals and rivers by which china is intersected tend greatly to facilitate the conveyance of every kind of merchandise and its prodigious population occasions a rapid consumption a single merchant shall often transport to one city  000 caps proper for the season and they shall all be sold in three or four days in a word the most frequented fairs of europe is but a faint picture of that immense number of buyers and sellers with which the large cities of china are continually crowded  there are none but the poorest families that cannot with a little contrivance find means to subsist very easily by their trade many whose whole stock shall not exceed a crown and yet the father and mother with two or three children are maintained by the little trade they carry on get silk garments and in a few years enlarge their commerce to something considerable  this may be difficult to comprehend and yet it happens daily for instance one of these small traders possessing about  s shall buy sugar meal and rice and make small cakes which he has baked an hour or two before day to warm as they express it the heart of travelers and his shop shall be scarcely opened before his merchandise is carried off by country people who crowd the cities every morning by workmen porters and children of the district this little trade produces in a few hours  s  d more than the principal the half of which is sufficient to maintain the whole family so that by thus saving daily a little money they are enabled to deal to a larger extent and at the end of a few years it is not uncommon to see a petty shop converted into a warehouse  trade being so extensive in all the interior parts of china no wonder the inhabitants are so little desirous of foreign trade especially as they hold all foreigners in a very contemptible light indeed they are not at all calculated for maritime commerce seldom do any of their ships go beyond the straits of sunda to achen batavia and japan at japan the articles which they barter and which they fetch from camboya and siam produce them cent per cent from china immediately to japan they export drugs sugar hides silks satins silken strings for instruments sandal wood european cloth and camblets in these last they have a quick sale but as they are imported by the dutch the chinese never carry them unless they can sell them at the same price and yet they affirm they gain  0 per cent which shows what a profit the dutch made by their trade if one could depend on the honesty of a chinese it would be easy for the europeans to have commerce with japan by their means but this is not to be done unless we were to bear them company be masters of the cargo and had a sufficient force to prevent insults by sugar they gain sometimes  000 per cent for silk what costs in china but six taels will sell at japan for fifteen  the merchandise which chinese traders bring back from japan are fine pearls by which they gain  000 per cent red copper in bars which they buy for three or four tael and sell in china for ten or twelve wrought copper sabreblades which produce  000 per cent smooth flowered paper of which the chinese make fans porcelain japanned works which are not equalled in any other part of the world by which their profits are immense gold which is very fine and a metal called tombac by which they gain  0 or  0 per cent at batavia  their trade with the manillas is much less profitable exporting a great deal of silk satins embroidery carpets cushions nightgowns silk stockings tea chinaware and japanned work by which they gain  0 per cent and bringing nothing back but pieces of eight  to batavia their trade is more regular easy and profitable exporting tea chinaware leafgold and gold thread tutaneg or toutenack a metal between tin and iron which gains   0 per cent drugs and copper utensils and bringing back silver in pieces of eight spices tortoiseshell of which the chinese make sundry toys combs boxes cups pipes and snuffboxes like those in europe and which cost but five pence sandal wood brazil wood for dying red and black wood agate stones ready cut which the chinese use as ornaments in dress yellow amber in lumps and european cloths by which they gain as much as when they sell them at japan  such is the greatest trade that the chinese carry on out of their own country they go to achen in november and december when the ships of bengal and surat are on the coast and sometimes to malacca cochinchina etc but they seldom import any thing from this country but spices those birdsnests i have described esteemed so delicious a dainty rice camphire rattan which is a kind of long cane and which they weave together like small strings and torches made of the leaves of certain trees that burn like pitch  their commerce with the russians which is very considerable and carried on at kiachta the frontiertown between chinese and russian tartary i have already largely dwelt on when i spoke of that country to which i must refer my reader it only remains to speak of their trade with europeans by sea  the gains of the english in a voyage to china arise from the goods brought back from thence and not from what are carried thither we buy the most part of their goods with silver lead is almost the only commodity for which the india company get more than prime cost we carry also scarlet blue black green and yellow broadcloth but the remnants or small pieces which are bought up cheap in england turn to better account than whole pieces of these small pieces the chinese make long purses which hang by their side tied by silken strings to their girdle  the following articles turn also to pretty good account if they can be smuggled ashore otherwise the charge and trouble will be equal to the profit large lookingglasses coralbranches flintware ordinary horsepistols with gilt barrels old wearingapparel of scarlet or blue cloth swordblades about   s a dozen hornspectacles about  s  d per dozen clocks and watches of small price small brass tweezercases and any new toy not imported  goods brought back are teas chinaware

value   l  s  d yielding a profit of    per cent but gold is a commodity not often bought there but by those who have more money to lay out than they have either room or privilege in the ship which seldom happens there are a great many sorts of goods that if got on shore in london without paying duty and sold to proper hands would make   or  00 per cent  a great deal depends on a persons knowledge of what things are likely to take in england and at what price they are commonly sold if a private trader would improve such a voyage to advantage he should consult with the hardware china or toymerchants in london and should carry with him musters or patterns by which things may be made and painted in china for the chinese workmen of all professions are so ingenious that they will imitate any thing that is shown to them to the greatest perfection and exactness  prices of goods sold at canton by the english company in      note one cattie is  0 ounces avoirdupoise sixteen tael

to china but must be smuggled into the country the importation being prohibited  the porcelain or chinaware is so various in quality and fashion that it is impossible to fix a price exquisitely fine enamelwork in cups and vessels is there made and would bring more profit than either teas or porcelain but are liable to be damaged in the voyage and would take up much room and as the duty on the exportation of all metals is as much as the prime cost such things must be smuggled out of canton the prices of late years may be collected from the prices of china goods sold at kiachta which will be found in pallass tour  the indiacompany trade is thus conducted at canton as soon as the ships come to an anchor at wampoo a couple of customhouse boats called happo are placed on each side of them to see that nothing is smuggled in or out of the ships and all boats that go up to the factory with goods or passengers must have a chop or permit from a customhouse officer there are three customhouses by the riverside distinguished by the emperors yellow colors on a long pole before the door at each of which these boats must call and be examined  when the supercargoes have agreed with the happo or customhouse with regard to the duty and with the merchants about the prices of goods on board and what kind of chinese goods are wanted to load with the customhouse retinue come on board measure the ship and weigh and take an account of all the goods which are immediately sent to the factors or the merchants house who buys them in a large sampan to prevent embezzlement there are two or three of the ships company well armed sent with the goods and a chinese customhouse officer after they arrive and the sampan is unloaded the merchant weighs them over again and the supercargoes after them in english scales for reasons which will be mentioned  the chinese merchants having agreed to provide such goods as are wanted in particular quantities at a fixed price and to have all ready against a certain time the supercargoes attend view and taste the goods and order every chest to be packed tarred weighed and marked after which they are carried from the chinese merchants warehouse to the factory  these warehouses are commonly large full of teas standing in baskets as they are brought from the field only the coarser teas are here mnt fine hyson is packed in chests lined with sheet lead to keep it from damps which would entirely spoil it two hundred cowlies or porters all naked to the middle are often seen packing and treading the tea in chests two of them get into a chest together and tread it down as it is filled if some nice british ladies were to see some of these fellows with their nasty feet and legs perform this office they would be apt to lose conceit of their beloved plant  the chinese warehouses are generally very spacious and contain large quantities of porcelain of all sizes and sorts fit for the european market the supercargoes attend packing this also for if a strict eye is not kept on them they will sometimes put up china cracked broken or of inferior quality they have even gone so far as to fill up chests with stones or bricks instead of the finest commodities which have not been discovered till they have been opened in england  if the chests are not immediately sent to the factory or to the ship it is absolutely necessary to leave a man or two to watch them in the merchants warehouse otherwise they may be subject to great abuse and there must be a guard on them all the way to the ships it requires a great deal of patience and cunning to trade with the chinese an even temper and a smooth tongue are qualifications absolutely necessary for a supercargo for they must be dealt with in the same crafty manner that they deal with others  every thing is sold by weight in china flesh fowls fruits rice etc and even liquids and to increase the weight they will cram their poultry with stones and gravel they will not scruple exchanging a live hog for a dead one if the latter is a little larger and they like them as well when they die of a distemper as when killed by a butcher for this purpose they will sometimes give such hogs as the english purchase alive a dose to kill them soon after they are brought on board and when we are obliged to throw them away will take them up and sell them again to their own people  every person dealing with the chinese must inspect their goods and be careful of their weights and measures if they would not be cheated their machines for weighing are so contrived that they can easily increase or diminish the weight by imperceptibly altering the beam the english therefore always use their own scales those also who have confided on their package have been no less deceived they have found chests boxes tubs and cannisters so exactly imitated and marked with damaged goods or things of little value and put in the place of fresh goods that the chest has not been discovered till brought as i have before observed to england  i myself says the author of this account who was was frequently at china once bought a piece of stuff for waistcoats and breeches without looking over the whole of it presuming it was all alike and sent it to the tailor but was much surprised on his bringing them home to find my waistcoat of different colors and different substances a gentleman of my acquaintance went into a goldsmiths shop to buy a gold head for his cane the goldsmith having none of the pattern he wanted but silverones told him he would make him one he did but this head afterward turned out to be a silverone gilt and was probably one of those he had seen in the shop when i have been in the shops i have had frequently my handkerchief fan or cane stolen from me and on demanding them again have only been laughed at to have used violence would have been only making a bad cause worse i knew a poor sailor who pulled out his purse to count a few dollars which he got from the purser at  0 per cent in order to buy a little tea etc for his homeward passage and a chinese observing him snatched the purse out of his hand ran off and the sailor after him and though several chinese saw the robbery yet not one of them offered to stop the thief but on the contrary laughed at the englishmans simplicity in attempting to recover it at last the chinese finding he was near overtaken threw the purse from him which the poor tar went and took up but to his great grief and mortification found only one dollar left had he overtaken the thief it is more than probable the mob would have rescued the villain and sent the poor sailor home to the factory half dead with blows for the mob are often so insolent to foreigners as if their was neither law or government in the country excepting when a mandarin passes and then they are all hush and stand aside with their eyes fixed on the ground  there is no one to complain to in such cases but the english linguist who always pretends that he cannot find the aggressor or if he be found that he denies the charge du halde gives a striking example of the dishonesty and unconcern of a chinese merchant the captain of an english vessel bargained with a chinese merchant at canton for several bales of silk which the latter was to provide against a certain time when they were ready the captain went with his interpreter to the house of the chinese merchant to examine whether they were sound and in good condition on opening the first bale all was right but the rest were damaged and good for nothing the captain on this fell in a passion and reproached the chinese merchant in the severest terms for his dishonesty the chinese after having heard him for some time with great coolness replied blame sir your knave of an interpreter he assured me that you would not inspect the bales  the chinese have but two sorts of money silver and copper their silver pieces have no proper figure but their value is regulated by their weight the copper money is not above nine tenths of an inch in diameter has a square hole in the middle and is stamped with two chinese words on the one side and two tartar words on the other numbers of them are strung like beads and are counted by strings not by pieces an ounce of silver is sometimes equivalent to  000 pieces of copper coin and sometimes only to  00 it is the intrinsic value of the metal that stamps the value of the coin their silver money is cast in large and small plates merely for the sake of trade and for want of small pieces a chinese carries always about him besides his scales and weights a pair of scissars with which he cuts the silver money in pieces and either gives or receives such pieces in buying goods when a chinese wants to cut a piece of silver he puts it between his scissars and knocks them against a stone till the piece drops off  the commerce of china is under the inspection of the tribunal of finances and the only commerce they consider as of any advantage to them is that which they keep up with tartary and russia as it furnishes them by barter with those furs which are so necessary and so much used in all the northern provinces the trade they carry on with the english and other europeans at canton they consider as prejudicial to the empire they take from us say they our silks our teas and our porcelain the price of these articles is consequently raised throughout the country such a trade therefore cannot be advantageous the money brought us by europeans and the highpriced baubles which accompany it are mere superfluities to such a state as ours we have no occasion for more bullion than what is necessary to answer the exigencies of government and to supply the relative wants of individuals  through the royal canal all barks from the south of china bound to peking must pass and their number is so considerable and they transport such quantities of merchandise and provisions that the duties collected on this canal alone amount annually to   0000 l sterling  the porcelain manufactory employs more workmen and contributes more to the good of commerce than any other as china abounds with potters earth of various kinds and of all colors there is a great difference between the porcelain of one province and that of another both in shape size and quality in some places vases are made four or five feet in diameter and three feet deep in others some are manufactured four or five feet high with a proportionable circumference these are used by the rich as basins to hold goldfish flowers aquatic plants etc and by the middling class as reservoirs for water or for containing pulse seeds and fruits they have also vases made of a kind of earth that has the property of sweetening and cooling water these are prefered to gold crystal or the finest porcelain and are used by the poor as well as rich  the finest china is made in the village kingtetching in the province of kiangsi in which are collected the best workmen it is reckoned to contain above a million of inhabitants who consume daily more than  0000 loads of rice and is as populous as the largest city in china it extends a league and a half along the banks of a beautiful river and is not a collection of straggling houses intermixed with gardens or spots of uncovered ground but the people complain of its being too crowded and that the streets are too narrow those who pass through them conceive themselves transported into the midst of a fair where nothing is heard but porters calling out to make way provisions are here dear being brought from very remote places and even the wood for the furnaces is brought from the distance of  00 leagues but notwithstanding the high price of provisions it is an asylum for a great number of poor families who could not subsist in any other place children and invalids find employment here and even the blind by pounding of colors the origin of the chinaware is not known but this is known from their words that in the year     of our era the workmen of this village have always furnished the emperor with porcelain and that one or two mandarins were sent from court to inspect their labors the word porcelain is of european derivation none of the syllables which compose it can be pronounced or written by the chinese porcellana in portuguese implies a cup or dish but porcelain in china is called tseki  the fine porcelain is so celebrated that we cannot here omit giving some account of the manner of preparing the paste this substance is produced by the mixture of two sorts of earth one purely white and fine to the touch and one intermixed with small shining particles these first materials are carried to the manufactories in shape of bricks the white fine earth is the fragments of rock from certain quarries reduced to powder which is washed and scummed and the fine sediment only used which being formed into cakes by moulds are sold by the hundred of the shining earth their are large mines and it is from this the fine porcelain derives all its strength for the white earth will acquire no firmness without it but of late years the chinese have discovered a species of chalk which when mixed with the white earth instead of the rockstone gives it a much finer grain but renders the china dearer the one being three times more expensive in the procuring and preparing than the other  to give a detail of the manner of making porcelain would be only swelling this account unnecessarily china being made in england and other countries i will only show that several causes concur in rendering the best china very dear in europe besides the great profit to the importers and that gained from them by the chinese factors it seldom happens that a burning or baking succeeds as it should it sometimes miscarries entirely and when the furnace is opened the porcelain together with the cases are found melted into a shapeless mass as hard as flint the chinese have greatest success in making different kinds of animals they have the art of making ducks and tortoises that will float in water entrecolles speaks of a porcelain cat an excellent imitation of nature in the head of which a lamp was fixed the flame forming its two eyes and the effect of this figure was such that the rats in the nightime were afraid to approach it the chinese set some value upon dresden china and still more so on the manufactures of seve  the use of glass is very ancient in china so early as the beginning of the third century and the remembrance of a glass jar presented to the emperor taitsou who mounted the throne in     is still preserved this vase or jar was so large that a mule might have entered it with as much ease as a gnat might have entered a pitcher and it was necessary in order to convey it to the palace to suspend it in a net the corners of which were fixed to four carriages  china appears to have been the natural and original country of the silkwork and the art of making silk from silkworms has been in that empire from the remotest antiquity  china indeed may be called a country of silk for it appears to be inexhaustible furnishing several nations in europe and asia and all the numerous inhabitants of china except the princes are clothed in damask and satin and they esteem that silk to be best which is fine soft and white they ever prefer the useful to the agreeable and confine themselves chiefly to the making of plain silks if they were certain of a market they would make as rich silks as any in europe they make cloth of gold but do not make the gold into small wire and cover thread with it as in europe but gild a long sheet of paper which they cut into shreds and cover threads of silk with it of course this does not last long and soon tarnishes with the damp  a manufacture of stockings ribbands and silkbuttons has been some time set up at canton all which are made very good the largest buttons may be bought for ten pence a dozen and silk stockings for a tael  the materials of chinese paper and the way of preparing it being different from those of europe it is necessary to give an account of this among other curious manufactures of the country chinese paper is of various kinds some is made of the rind or bark of the bamboo and cottontree but in fact every province has its peculiar kind of paper some is made of hemp some of wheat or ricestraw some of the skins found in the balls of silkworms some of soft bamboo and some of the mulberrytree bark of which it is the second coat or skin white and soft being first beat in water to a pulp it is made into sheets  0 or    feet long and afterward dipped in alumwater to glaze it and answer the purpose of size even the wood of the bamboo and cottonshrub may be and is converted into paper the young branches stripped of their outward bark are cut into slips and suffered to lie in water till they rot then boiled and beat into a pulp with heavy hammers after this it is mixed with an unctious juice extracted from a plant till it is reduced to thick clammy water the surface of which is taken up in moulds as we do the pulp of linen rags and forms paper after which it undergoes a process like sizing to make it bear the ink  this account of their paper leads me to describe their ink the chinese or indian ink as we call it is not fluid like ours but solid like our mineral colors though much lighter it is made of lampblack of several kinds but the best is that obtained by hogsgrease to which they mix a sort of oil to make it smoother and some odorous ingredients to take off the rancid smell when mixed into a paste it is formed in moulds into small sticks as we receive it in england but their printing ink is a liquid made of lampblack well beaten sifted through a sieve and exposed to the sun and afterward tempered with aquavitae till it is of the thickness of paste after this it is thinned for use they print only on one side of their paper hence it is that every leaf of their books is folded the fold being at the edge of the book and the opening at the back where they are sewn together so that their books are cut at the back whereas ours are cut at the edges their ordinary books are covered with pasteboard but the better sort are bound in fine satin or flowered taffety  the art of printing so recent in europe has existed in china from the remotest antiquity but it differs very much from ours they do not print from types but engrave the page on wood so as to be a fac simile of the copy imitating it exactly and to print from this engraving the printer uses two brushes one puts on the ink on the engraved wood and the other when the wood is covered with a sheet of paper is drawn dry over it and this makes it receive the impression one man is able to throw off  0000 copies in a day and booksellers in china have no occasion to print more than they can vend  the chinese do not write with pens like europeans but with a rabbithair pencil holding it perpendicular and writing from top to bottom but like the hebrews from right to left so that the end of our book is the beginning of theirs  they have a pretty method of silvering paper if we may so call it at a small expense and without using any silver in order to this they take two scruples of a size or glue made of leather one of alum and half a pint of clear water these they simmer over a gentle fire till the water is evaporated that is till no more steam arises and with a pencil spread two or three layers of this glue over paper laid smooth on a table then through a fine sieve sift over the paper a powder made of talc and alum which having been boiled in water is dried in in the sun and pounded this done the sheets are hung up in the shade to dry and when quite dry are again laid on a table and rubbed gently with clean cotton to take off the superfluous powder which is used again  they distill a spirit called arrack from rice in great quantities proclamations prohibiting this distillery are often published and officers are appointed to visit the stillhouses and destroy the furnaces but if the owner slips a few pieces of silver into his hand the business is winked at the mandarin sometimes goes round himself and the workmen if caught are seized and whipped the masters then conceal themselves for a short time change their habitations and begin again for as the sale of arrack is not prohibited numbers of carts loaded with this liquor enter peking daily the duty is paid at the gate and it is sold publicly in more than a thousand shops throughout the city and suburbs  i must not omit mentioning the pearlfishery and i cannot do it better than in this place pearls being fished up in some of the rivers which empty into the saghalienoula and these rivers being very shallow the diverse plunge boldly to the bottom of the water and having collected whatever oysters they can as chance directs return to the bank with their load this fishery belongs to the emperor but the greater part of the pearls are small and not of a fine water a much more beautiful kind is found in greater abundance in other rivers in tartary which flow into the eastern sea  the emperor sends every year to this fishery a certain number of men chosen from the eight tartar bands the first three bands which are most celebrated and numerous furnish    companies the other five furnish    each company has a captain and a sergeant three superior officers command the whole and a certain number of merchants well acquainted with the nature of pearls accompany them all these companies for their permission to fish must every year give the emperor    0 pearls pure and without blemish when these fishers return the pearls they bring are examined if they are few in number the officers are mulcted in their pay or cashiered for negligence  chap xi of their government laws policy and revenue the chinese government is built on the ancient patriarchal whatever authority the patriarchs had over their families the emperor of china has over his subjects no potentate on earth possesses so unlimited a power as the sovereign of this numerous people he is styled holy son of heaven sole governor of the earth great father of his people etc he is the undisputed master of the lives of his subjects though he seldom exerts this prerogative but to promote their happiness no sentence of death pronounced by any of the tribunals no verdict in civil cases no determination of any moment can be enforced till it has been confirmed by him on the other hand whatever sentence he passes is immediately executed all edicts from the throne are as much respected as if they proceeded from a divinity he has the disposal of all offices of state and the appointment of viceroys and governors no employment is here purchased merit for the most part raising to place and place exalting to rank family is no recommendation and even titles are not hereditary but in the family of confucius their ancient lawgiver the emperor has a right of nominating two successors whether from his own family or from any of his subjects and as he can ennoble so can he degrade a plebeian today may be a nobleman tomorrow and a nobleman one day may rank with a plebeian the next  there are only two ranks of men in china viz the nobility and the people the first is composed of mandarins of letters and of war and these enjoy every valuaable privilege in cases of necessity may remonstrate with the emperor either individually or in a body and their remonstrances are never ill received but the emperor acts as he pleases notwithstanding  the literati are highly honored in china but government checks their pride and encourages their labors to attain the eminence of a mandarin of letters a man must be first bachelor secondly licentiate and lastly doctor when several places become vacant the emperor invites to court a like number of the literati whose names are inserted in a list and these choose the vacant governments by lot  there are eight orders of mandarins of letters in the first are ministers of state presidents of supreme tribunals and all the superior officers of the militia the chief of this list is president of the emperors councils and great confidence is reposed in him the second men are the viceroys and presidents of the supreme councils of the different provinces of the third order are the secretaries to the emperor the fourth order if not governors are to repair the harbors royal lodginghouses and the barks the fifth order has the inspection of the troops the sixth the care of the highways the seventh the superintendance of rivers and the eighth that for seacoasts these are all mandarins of letters and to them is entrusted the administration of the chinese empire from among them are chosen the governors of provinces of cities of the first second and third class and the presidents and members of all the tribunals honors are lavished on them and every privilege and mark of distinction reserved for them alone the homage paid by the people to every mandarin in office is almost equal to that of the emperor himself they amount in number to more than   000 and yet the veneration the people entertain for them is always the same  when any mandarin quits his office if he has acted in it to the satisfaction of the people they load him with such marks of honor as would engage the most stupid to be in love with virtue and justice when he is taking his leave in order to relinquish his office almost all the inhabitants go into the highways to entertain him and place themselves some here some there for almost    or    miles together so that every where in the road are seen tables handsomely painted with satin tablecloths covered with sweetmeats tea and other liquors  every one almost constrains him to stay to sit down and eat or drink something he no sooner leaves one than another stops him and thus he stands the whole day amidst the applauses and acclamations of his people and what is more every one desires to have something belonging to him some take his boots others his cap others his greatcoat giving him at the same time another of the same sort and before he is quit of this multitude it sometimes happens he has changed his boots thirty times these boots which perhaps have only been on and off are considered as valuable ornaments those which are first taken off are suspended in a cage over the gate by which he quitted the city the rest are preserved by his friends with the same care as a french warrior would preserve the sword of a turenne or a bayard  public honors are dispensed with a more sparing hand on the mandarins of arms these never have the smallest share in the public administration not even the inspection of the troops but to be a mandarin of arms a man must pass through gradations of military science such as bachelor licentiate and doctor of arms these hold tribunals the members of which are selected from among their chiefs among these they reckon princes dukes and counts all these dignities or others equivalent are found in china the president of this tribunal is one of the great lords of the empire whose authority extends over all the army and corresponds with our commander in chief this president has for his assessor or assistant a mandarin of letters who is the superintendant of arms  the chief of the mandarins of arms is a general by birth and has a certain number of mandarins who act as lieutenantgenerals colonels captains lieutenants and ensigns under him the number of mandarins of arms are between    and  0000  there are six tribunals established at peking and the presidents of these are the emperors grand council which consists of all the ministers of state and the assessors of the six sovereign courts or tribunals of which i am going to speak  the first tribunal watches over the conduct of the several provinces keeps a journal of their good and bad transactions reports them to the emperor who punishes or rewards them according to its report and is a kind of civil inquisition the second has the superintendance of the finances of the state as the coins money collects the duties directs the public magazines and keeps an exact register of all the families that compose this vast empire the third is that of ceremonies regulates them and enforces their observance repairs all temples arranges the annual sacrifices receives and entertains ambassadors has the inspection of arts and sciences and preserves tranquillity among the different religious sects here tolerated the fourth is the tribunal of arms has the wardepartment and control of the army and is composed of mandarins of letters only the fifth is the criminal bench and the sixth has the care and charge of all the public works palaces buildings tombs monuments bridges streets rivers highways barks and every thing relating to inland and foreign navigation  the members which compose these different tribunals are half chinese and half tartars and one of the two presidents of each tribunal is always a tartar born each tribunal has also several subordinate ones among whom the offices in its department are divided these superior tribunals are none of them absolute but are checked by the interference of others and lest a combination of the whole should act contrary to the interest of the sovereign a censor is appointed over each who watches their conduct revises their acts and reports to the emperor these men hold their offices for life and therefore are emboldened to speak out when they see reason for it their accusation sets an enquiry on foot and the accused is discharged from his office were he even one of the first men in the empire an example of this kind was once made of three mandarins who were found to have taken money clandestinely for some services done by them in the execution of their office the emperor not only degraded them from their office but ordered them to retire into the class of common men and one of them who had been a great while a magistrate and was much esteemed for his understanding and respected for his age was condemned to attend one of the palacegates with other common soldiers among whom he was inlisted but when on duty as a sentinel the people would bow to him still respecting him on the slender remains of that honor he just before possessed  the censors of these six tribunals form also a tribunal of themselves which has the inspection of the whole empire placed as it were between the throne and the mandarins the sovereign is master of their lives but many of them having a power to remonstrate to the crown have patiently suffered death rather than betray the cause of truth or wink at abuses as we have seen in the instance of the emperor banishing his mother  over this tribunal there is a supreme one that of princes no where known but in china composed of of princes only some of the ordinary mandarins belong to it as subaltern officers to draw cases and prepare writings but this is all all the children of the imperial family are entered among them as soon as born and to these are also consigned the dignities and titles which the emperor confers on them this tribunal is the only court where they can be tried and in cases of accusation it absolves or punishes them according to its pleasure  an extract from chinese history relates a circumstance which happened in a late war with one of the kings of tartary the emperor sent a mighty army under his brothers command to punish the vanity and rashness of that puny king who had dared to make inroads on the emperors allies the tartar whose warlike troops waited only for an opportunity of signalizing themselves advanced to the imperial army attacked them and routed them notwithstanding he was far inferior in number  the emperors fatherinlaw an old tartar well versed in the trade of war commanded the artillery and played his part so well that he was killed at the head of a few yet brave soldiers whom he encouraged as well by his example as his words but the general was accused of flying first and drawing by his flight the rest of the army after him the emperor who was himself a man of courage being less troubled at the loss of a battle than he was at that of his brothers honor sent for him to court and tried him before a council of the blood royal and the princes the royal general who was on all other accounts a man of singular merit surrendered himself with the same humility and submission as any inferior officer would have done and without waiting till sentence was pronounced condemned himself and owned that he deserved death you deserve it said the emperor but you ought to recover your lost honor to seek your death in the midst of the enemys troops and not here amongst us in the midst of peking where it can only increase your disgrace at last the emperor was disposed to pardon him but the princes who thought themselves disgraced by this action earnestly begged of the emperor to use the utmost of his power to punish him and his uncle who assisted at the council treated him with so much scorn and contempt that with us such usage to a gentleman would be worse than death  there is a tribunal inferior to all the rest called the tribunal of history composed of the greatest geniusses of the empire and men of the most profound erudition to them is entrusted the education of the heirapparent to the throne and the compilation and arranging the general history of the nation from this body are generally chosen the mandarins of the first class and the presidents of the supreme tribunals this is a court formidable even to the emperor himself it being proof against seduction for was the sovereign to attempt it it would be consigned to history in spite of all his efforts to suppress it  it is the duty of each of these persons who compose this tribunal by himself and without communication with the rest as things fall out to set them down on a loose piece of paper and put these papers through a chink into an office set apart for this purpose in these papers both the emperors virtues and faults are constantly recorded with the same liberty and impartiality such a day say they the princes behavior was unseasonable and intemperate he spoke in a manner unbecoming his dignity the punishment he inflicted on such an officer was rather the effect of passion than the result of justice in such an affair he stopped the sword of justice and partially abrogated the sentence passed by the magistrates or else he entered wisely into a war for the defense of his people and the honor of his empire at such a time he made an honorable peace he gave such and such marks of love to his people and so on and that neither fear on one side nor hope on the other may bias these men to partiality this office is never opened during that princes life or whilst any of his family sit on the throne when the crown goes into another line which often happens all these loose memoirs are gathered up and after being compared to come at the certain knowledge of the truth they from them compose the history of that emperor to propose him as an example to posterity if he acted wisely or to expose him to the common odium of the people if he has acted otherwise when therefore a prince who loves honor and glory and hopes hereafter to live in the dutiful memory of his subjects and sees that it is not in the power of flattery and imposture to persuade the people to give it to him he will be circumspect and cautious how he behaves himself during his whole reign  no fees are paid for the administration of justice so that every poor man can prosecute his own rights and is freed from being oppressed by the opulence of his adversary and there being no barristers in china a bad cause is never glossed over nor the judges mind perverted by fallacious and sophistical reasoning the goodness of a cause is its best advocate and if sentence is given against a man in one court he can appeal to a higher and the definitive sentence is always given by the emperor  with them as i have observed nobility is never hereditary nor is there any distinction of rank except what office gives so that independent of the family of confucius who are looked upon with reverence who is considered as the legislator and of whom i shall speak hereafter the whole kingdom is divided into magistracy and commonalty there are no lands but what are held by soccagetenure not even templelands or those destined for the priests so that their gods as well as men are subject to the state and by taxes and contributions obliged to acknowledge the emperors supremacy when a viceroy or governor dies his children as well as those of other men have their fortunes to make and if they inherit not their fathers virtue and ingenuity his name which they bear be it ever so renowned will entitle them to no rank or precedence by this statemaxim trade rises in estimation and the emperors revenues increase as no estates are taxfree and familyinfluence never gains such an ascendancy as to inconvenience the prince and it is lastly a received opinion among the chinese that if an emperor would be obliged he should lay his commands on his subjects and not on little kings  all mandarins are obliged every three years to give in an exact account in writing of the faults they have committed in the discharge of their office this kind of confession is examined at court and the emperor makes private enquiry into the truth of them and whether such mandarins have done their duty if they have they are rewarded if not they are tried disgraced dismissed and punished and every three years the viceroy or governor of each province makes his report to the emperor of the conduct of the mandarins in his district the principal mandarins are sometimes broke and dismissed from all employments at other times are only removed a few degrees lower and appointed to some inferior office and a singular regulation which exists only in china is that every mandarin degraded to an inferior office is in the execution of that office obliged at the head of all the warrants or precepts he issues to mention the number of steps he has lost thus for example he will say  i such a mandarin degraded three four or six steps according as the case may be order and command etc and the inspector of a province has an unlimited authority over such mandarins and can by his own power deprive them of their employment never consulting the court but in cases where immediate punishment is not necessary  and that the mandarins may be more in the emperors power the offices about court are given to the sons of mandarins by which means these sons remain as hostages for their fathers good conduct  the emperors of the chinese have seldom appeared in public but the present tartarfamily show themselves to the people about four times a month when he visits the frontiers of tartary as he does almost every year  0 or  0 tartar princes attend to do him homage but he visits the provinces riding post with only a few of his officers guards being planted along the roads for his security  an unbounded authority which the laws give the emperor and a necessity which the same laws lay on him to use that authority with moderation and discretion are the two props which have for  000 years supported this great fabric of the chinese monarchy he never presumes to enact a law but with the concurrence of the great council or ever suspend or alter one but with their approbation but he is so absolute that the grave itself cannot put an end to his power over his subjects for when he has a mind to disgrace or honor families he will confer titles or infamy even on the dead  the women are excluded from having any share in their government or councils and by way of derision having learned that women are sometimes vested with sovereign power in this part of the world they call europe the ladies empire  their civil laws are almost all taken from their canonical books of morality and filial piety is their basis jurisprudence is taught in china in the same manner as the principles rules and mysteries of religion are in other countries all their laws being maxims of civil and social duty many of them i have already set forth under their manners and customs but no laws can be more severe than their penal laws and these laws are so combined that no fault escapes punishment and the correction never exceeds the crime committed every person accused is examined by five tribunals each examines the process and their enquiries are directed not only against the accused but the prosecutor and his witnesses the culprit remains it is true in prison during all this slow process but prisons here are not dungeons they are spacious and convenient it is the duty of a mandarin to inspect them frequently to see the prisoners properly treated to send for physicians when they need it he being responsible for the sick if any man dies in prison the emperor is informed of it and another mandarin is dispatched to examine into circumstances and see if the inspecting mandarin has done his duty  prisons in great cities are so large that they consist of several streets with marketplaces walks gardens canals etc like the palaces in canton alone it is said there are not less than   000 prisoners the offenders are allowed to work in the daytime for their living the emperors allowance being but small and the chinese not being very charitably disposed  the slightest of all their punishments is the bastinado it is a mere paternal correction which has no infamy annexed to it the emperor even orders it on some of his courtiers but they are as respectable as before and a mandarin without ordering will if he meets any one abroad deserving of it inflict it immediately his officers of justice being always with him the number of blows is in proportion to the crime but never less than  0 the infliction is with a cudgel on the breech by throwing the offender on the ground the offender afterward if he is able falls down to the mandarin and thanks him for his kind correction though one blow is enough to lame him if the officer is not bribed  the baton or pantsee a piece of bamboo a little flatted is an instrument of punishment which every mandarin may use at pleasure either when any one forgets to salute him or when he administers public justice on these occasions he sits gravely behind a table on which is placed a bag of small sticks his officers furnished with some of these pantsees and waiting only his signal to use them when he means to punish any one he takes one of these small sticks from the bag and throws it into the hall of audience the culprit is then seized laid down on the ground his breeches pulled down to his heels and a strong domestic gives him five blows of his pantsee and another succeeds and gives him five more if the mandarin draws another stick from the bag and so on as long as the mandarin thinks proper after this the criminal is to throw himself on his knees and thank his judge for the attention he has been pleased to bestow on him  the punishment of the wooden collar is also used in china this is composed of two pieces of wood like the yoke by which men carry pails which put together enclose the head and fit the shoulders they are so large that the criminal can neither see his feet nor put his hand to his mouth so that he cannot eat without being fed it generally weighs from  0 to  0 lb weight though some weigh  00lb for greater offenses and the offender is obliged to carry this about with him day and night the time for a robbery disturbing the peace of a family or being a notorious gambler is three months he is not at liberty to take shelter in his own house but stationed for a certain time in some public square at the gate of a city or at the tribunal where he was condemned when the term of his punishment is expired he is brought before the mandarin receives an admonition from him and is discharged after having received  0 sound blows  other crimes less than homicide are punished by banishment for life to tug the royal barks for three years or be branded in the cheeks  theft from relations is more severely punished than theft from strangers whoever informs against his parents grandfather or grandmother uncle or eldest brother is condemned to receive  00 blows of the pantsee and be banished for three years though the accusation may be just and if false the accuser is strangled all incest is punishable according to the offense a grandson deficient in duty to his parents grandfather or grandmother receives  00 blows of the pantsee if he gives them abusive language he is strangled if he lifts his hand against them he is beheaded and if he wounds or maims them his flesh is torn from his bones with redhot pincers and he is cut into  0000 pieces if a younger brother abuses his elder he receives  00 blows of the pantsee and if he dares to strike him he is banished  homicide is punished with death the man who kills another even in an accidental quarrel is strangled without remission a rope of about six or seven feet long with a running noose is thrown over the criminals head a couple of domestics belonging to the tribunal pull it strongly in different directions then on a sudden quit it a few moments after they give it a second pull which generally does the business and a third is seldom nenessary  the cutting in  0000 pieces is a kind of punishment never known but in china and too horrid to be related this torture is also too severe for a feeling mind to bear any description of of course i trust my readers will excuse it but to soften their severity these cruel inflictions are never exercised but in cases of high treason and other extraoffences and no sentence of death is put into execution till it has been approved and confirmed by the emperor after a careful examination into the whole of the trial nor does he sign the deathwarrant till he has prepared himself by fasting  le comte assures us that it is a common thing for men to let themselves out to be bastinadoed in the room of the criminal and the near relation of an accused person acknowledged to be guilty is permitted to put himself in his place and suffer the infliction of the law for his friend if the punishment be a light one a chinese condemned to banishment may take his family with him and the relations of all persons accused are encouraged to administer to their wants and comforts in prison and such is their national humanity that the ability of a judge who has been able to detect a criminal among all his subterfuges to elude justice is less esteemed than one whose penetration has saved an innocent man when conspiracy and malevolence have combined to ruin him  the emperor himself is treated little less than a divinity if he is dangerously ill the palace is full of mandarins of every order who spend night and day in a large court in habits proper for the occasion to express their own grief and ask of heaven their princes cure rain snow cold or any other inconvenience never excuse them from this duty and as long as the emperor is in pain or in danger any one that saw the people would think that they feared nothing but the loss of him  though the prince can nominate his successor he never changes the succession but suffers the crown to be hereditary unless the next heir has forfeited his claim by the commission of some crime such princes of the blood as have merit to recommend them are always titled and protected but such as are untitled are subject to the same police as every other citizen and if they commit a crime and are tried before any tribunal are treated with the utmost rigor and no sum of money however great can exempt them from punishment  no kind of service rendered to the state is either forgotten or goes unrewarded and nothing is neglected in china that has any relation to government even the gazette printed daily at peking and circulated throughout the empire is made subservient to the constitution the writers of these papers never dare to insult the nation with the abilities or success of a buffoon with the description of a new dance or with the graces and figure of a comedian but in this gazette may be seen the names of those mandarins who are deprived of their offices the cause of their disgrace and the names of those whose merit has raised them to a post of eminence it takes the earliest opportunity of publishing the name of the most obscure soldier who has displayed courage and intrepidity in battle announces to the whole empire an act of filial piety or an example of female modesty even in the humblest rustic mentions the crimes of all those delinquents punished with death acquaints the people with every step government takes and contains even the remonstrances which superior tribunals take the liberty of presenting to the sovereign nothing however is inserted till the emperor has seen it death would be the consequence to the authors or the printer if it was  the emperors revenue amounts to above    millions sterling and he might easily increase it by new impositions but seldom exercises this privilege for he can levy what taxes he pleases for the exigencies of government the common tax is about a tenth part of the profits of all professions which is seldom exceeded and the emperor every year exempts some one or more of the provinces from paying any especially if they have been visited by any epidemic sickness unfavourable weather or any other calamity  an account of every mans family estate and substance with the taxes due to the crown is taken every year and enrolled a copy of which is hung up at the door of every mans house and the master is obliged to carry in the emperors duties to the mandarins without being called on on pain of imprisonment and the bastinado till done so that all the charges of collectors and receivers is saved and the mandarins pay in theirs to the treasury of the province who transmits the surplus to peking after he has paid the governors officers and soldiers of the province and other necessary charges of government are defrayed  the greatest part of the taxes are paid in kind and the officers of government are all furnished with every necessary both for food and clothing so that the commodities paid in taxes are almost all consumed in those provinces in which they are levied what remains is sold for the emperor those taxes paid in money arise from the customs and the sale of salt which belongs solely to the emperor and other imports the trader scarcely contributes any thing all seems to fall upon the husbandman  the annual expenses of government are immense but they are so regulated that great savings are yearly made and these savings support a war or defray other contingent expenses in short there is so little want of money that though china as i have observed contains many mines of gold and silver they are not suffered to be opened  their money having been spoken of i have only to observe they keep up a balance in the value of copper of which their small coin is made never suffering it to be so low in value as to tempt men to coin nor so high in value as to induce them to convert the coin to other purposes  chap xii of their army having treated of their navy when giving an account of their rivers and ports i shall here only speak of their army  the conduct and business is as i have already noticed under the control of the mandarins of letters but the fieldofficers are all mandarins of arms the president of whose tribunal is commanderinchief it is computed that there are between    or  0000 mandarins of war the troops of the empire amount to more than  00000 and yet they are maintained with five millions sterling whereas only  00000 of english foot cost our government two millions rating the maintenance of a soldier at fifteen pounds per year yet no army is better clothed than the chinese better paid or better armed this numerous army reminds us of those of xerxes and darius but if we consider the extent of the empire and its great population it is not so extraordinary  the pay of a chinese or tartarsoldier is about twopencehalfpenny and a measure of rice per day that of a horseman is double the pay of a footsoldier the emperor furnishes a horse and the trooper receives two measures chinese guard presented to the emperor of small beans daily arrears are paid up every three months  the emperor frequently reviews his army at which time he is seated upon a carpet spread for him in the field and attended on the right by the commander in chief and by his chief mandarins on the left see the plate where the officers of the guards after the evolutions are gone through are presented to him the guards at a distance on their bended knee at every review their arms are carefully inspected those of a horseman consist of a helmet a cuirass a lance and a large sabre footsoldiers are armed with a pike and sabre some of them with fuzees others with bows and arrows if any of these are found in bad condition or in any respect rusted the neglect is immediately punished if the offender is a chinese by  0 or  0 blows with a stick if a tartar with as many lashes  the horseguards of peking are above   0000 divided into eight battallions each of which has a banner distinguished by the colors viz yellow white red and blue or by the border viz yellow with a red border white with ditto red with a white border and blue with a red border green is the color of the chinese banner each batallion has a general and under him several lieutenantgenerals each batallion has  00 companies well officered and the men are pretty well disciplined they are rather tumultuous in their march but want neither skill nor ability in performing their different evolutions the horse form themselves into squadrons make an attack engage and rally without the least difficulty by the sound of a trumpet or a horn they ride with short stirrups their knees up to the saddle which enables them to rise on their stirrups and give a heavier blow indeed all persons in china ride in this manner the chinese soldiers in general handle a sabre well and they show much dexterity in shooting with bows and arrows but notwithstanding this they are easily routed owing to an effeminate education that boys receive and the little use they have to make use of their weapons to see them reviewed one would think them sufficient to awe all asia but the western tartars think nothing of their numbers and frequently say in derision that the neighing of a tartar horse is enough to rout all the chinese cavalry yet they take all possible care to have good soldiers for they take no officers into the guards till they have made trial of their stoutness dexterity and skill in military knowledge  the soldiers look very smart are neatly dressed in blue nanking stuff their gowns short and narrow with ratan caps on their heads and a bunch of red hair fixed on the top of them which when they perform any quick motion or are agitated by the wind make a grand appearance especially when four or five hundred of them are marching in a body their boots are of silk lined with cotton their principal arms are the sword and bow the former is very large heavy and broad they wear them on the left side but with the handle behind and the point hanging down forward when they draw them they with the left hand take hold of the lower end of the scabbard and lift up the sword behind them so high that the handle may reach above the shoulder behind so that at the drawing the sword with the right hand over the left shoulder they can give a quick and a heavy stroke and awkward as this may appear to those who are unused to it it is certain they do it with great case and agility the effect of constant practice  their bows are very large and strong and are carried in a case on the left side with a quiver of arrows on their back on the right thumb they wear a broad and thick ivory or agate ring on which they place the string of the bow when they draw it and have another ring on the left thumb for the arrow to run upon when they shoot  the officers in sunshine make a splendid appearance their dress being embroidered with gold and silver on the back and breast where their badges of distinction are fixed and which make a glittering show they all wear whiskers as do the common men and have a fierce look the common tartarsoldiers though brought from the north have tawny complexions and their fierce countenances sufficiently distinguish them from the natives of china who are more effeminate and softfeatured  there is a large plain below canton where the cavalry quartered in that city are frequently exercised and is a kind of large horsecourse with posts fixed at small distances in this broad path the soldiers will ride one after another with incredible swiftness shooting their arrows at these posts they will dismount from their horses in full gallop take up their arms present and shoot again and what is still more surprising will mount and dismount in their career for the same arrow making use of one only all the way round but this last operation is performed only by the more experienced soldiers  though there is reason to believe that the use of artillery is very ancient in china it appears to have been totally lost about the beginning of the last century but father verbiest a jesuitmissionary revived it and by order of the emperor put them in the way to cast a new set and he raised the chinese artillery to the number of   0 pieces the same jesuit taught them the method of fortifying towns and of constructing fortresses for the jesuits in europe were not contented with sending zealous missionaries to china but thought it necessary that their zeal should be united with other useful talents this wise precaution procured them admission to the center of the empire which till then had been shut up against every stranger  chinese army on the march   it is now computed that there are more than  000 places of arms in china and  000 towers or castles dispersed throughout the whole empire all of which are garrisoned the fortresses besides the principal strength derived from their situation are defended by a rampart a brickwall towers and a ditch filled with water a certain city of antiquity stood once a siege of ten years but the neighbors of the chinese have long since lost the true art of attack  nature itself however has sufficiently fortified this country the sea with a very shallow shore borders six of the provinces so that large vessels cannot come near them inaccessible mountains cover them on the west and the remaining part is defended by the great wall  they depend chiefly upon the tartars for their safety for since a tartarprince has been upon the throne every tartar is enrolled a soldier from his cradle as soon as he is of sufficient age to carry arms he is disciplined and must be ready to take the field upon the shortest notice  when they take the field their banners are carried in chariots of war which are little else than large boxes without covers that will hold three fixed upon two low wheels and drawn by four horses conducted by reins and caparisoned with armor they have a kind of steel petticoat that surrounds their legs like bayess troop in the rehearsal and a frontlet of steel put on their faces with holes to see through on one side of the chariot is the banner fixed upright and on the other side are several pikes lances and halberts set up in the same manner the general rides in a chariot alone guiding his horses himself with two pikes fixed up before him the horses of which are better clothed and armed having pieces of armor over their necks and tails and when so equipped have very much the appearance of rhinoceroses even their very tails are clothed  though no kind of service rendered to the state is either neglected or forgotten military services are much less so than others government in time of war bestows distinctions and rewards with a lavish hand it extends its favors even to the lowest if a common horse or footsoldier falls in battle his hair his bow or his sabre is transmitted to his family to be interred in the sepulcher of his ancestors instead of his body an eulogium suited to his achievement is sent to be engraven on his tomb if an officer falls a sacrifice to his countrys cause either his whole armor his ashes his bones or his whole body if it can be found is conveyed to his relations and according to their respective ranks certain ceremonies are performed in commemoration of some and certain monuments erected to others the body of an officer or the hair etc of a soldier will be transported on such occasions to the distance of  000 or   00 leagues if his family is so far distant the soldier as well as the officer is mentioned in the gazette and his name thus passes before the eyes of the public and thence into the general history of the empire but no sooner shall the war be at an end and peace restored than the appearance of this vast army is almost lost no soldier is permitted to wear arms in public except when at a review when he mounts guard or accompanies any mandarin all return to the state of and appear like plain and humble citizens and pursue their respective trades  the greater part of the tartarsoldiers at peking with their families are lodged either in immense barracks erected in the suburbs or in the adjacent country and every common man is allowed a complete and separate apartment for the use of his family the officers have houses and in the midst are public schools for the education of the tartaryouth  in order to secure the throne in the present tartarfamily the principal military offices are given to tartars a campaign is generally reckoned to be two years service an exact journal is kept of every military transaction and those who have given proofs of valor or superior skill are there mentioned with honor promotion is the consequence of merit if an officer survives if not his rewards are conferred on his widow children or brothers neither the father of a great family an only son nor the son of an aged widow is obliged to serve as a soldier unless the state be in great danger or in cases of the most urgent necessity and then government advances money to those who enlist and gives them double pay whilst they serve one for themselves and one for their families in short rewards are always ready for those who have done their duty and punishment is not slow in reaching those who neglect it  chap xiii of their religion father amiot an impartial and competent judge of the literature history and antiquities of china gives the result of his laborious researches respecting the primitive religion of that country in the following words the chinese are a distinct people who have still preserved the characteristic marks of their first origin a people whose primitive doctrine will be found by those who take the trouble of examining it thoroughly to agree in its essential parts with the doctrines of the chosen people before moses explained it in the sacred records a people whose traditional knowledge when freed from the ignorance and superstition of latter ages may be traced back without interruption for the space of more than  000 years even to the renewal of the human race by the grandsons of noah  there is every historical probability to support the belief that the colony which first peopled china were composed of the immediate descendants of noah the king or canonical books of the chinese every where confirm the idea of a supreme being the creator and preserver of all things the rewarder of good actions and the punisher of evil ones and mysterious as it may seem serve to favor the doctrine of a trinity and the doctrine of the existence and attributes of the supreme being and of the worship and homage due to him has subsisted in china pure and without change during a long series of ages  peking contains at present two principal temples the tientan and the titan in the construction of which the chinese have displayed all the elegance and magnificence of their architecture they are both dedicated to the changti or supreme lord the ceremonies with which modern sacrifices are attended are greatly multiplied and nothing can equal the splendour and magnificence with which the emperor is surrounded when he performs this solemn and sacred duty he alone in quality of the father of the nation has a right to offer up sacrifice and from the manner on the one hand in which he prepares himself by fasting for this high solemnity the innumerable crowd of princes lords and officers that surround him in his procession to the temple the magnificence of the vestments utensils etc all in gold and on the other hand from the manner in which he performs his prostrations rolls in the dust and speaks of himself to the changti in terms of the most abject submission it may easily be perceived that he assumes so much pomp and splendour only for the purpose of declaring in a more sensible and striking manner the infinite distance between the supreme being and man  the ceremony of plowing and opening the earth has sacrifice previous to it prepared by fasting and prayer and the grain grown from what he sows being afterward preserved for future sacrifices are convincing proofs that there is more than policy in the encouragement of agriculture in the ceremony in short it is a religious ceremony and has been continued in china from the remotest antiquity  the religion of this country is however after all but idolatry but of all idolaters on the face of the earth nieuhoff observes that the chinese have fallen into the fewest absurdities there are three sects here tolerated that of the learned who follow the doctrine of the ancient book and look upon confucius as their master that of the disciples of laokien which is nothing but a web of extravagance and impiety and that of the idolaters who worship a divinity called fo whose opinions were introduced from india about    years after our saviors crucifixion  of the first of these sects are they who profess regularly to study it in order to advance themselves by the degrees and dignities of the empire the second has degenerated into magic and enchantment and the third is nothing but a heap of fables and superstitions to give some idea of these different sects i shall follow the order of time in which they took their rise  of the first i have said it has the supreme god for its object revived by confucius the chinese philosopher who is called in china coumtse and who was cotemporary with pythagoras a little before socrates having been born     years before the birth of christ this man was beloved by kings and the people reverenced him as a saint and even at this day they acknowledge no true hereditary nobility but in his family he made upwards of  000 proselytes and sent  00 of his disciples into different parts of the chinese empire to reform the manners of the people and died in the   d year of his age his gravity say historians and sobriety his rigorous abstinence his contempt of riches and what are commonly called the goods of this life his continual attention and watchfulness over his actions and above all that modesty and humility which are not to be found among the grecian sages all these would tempt us to believe that he was not a mere philosopher formed by reason only but a man inspired by god for the reformation of the world and to check that torrent of idolatry and superstition which was going to overspread that particular part of it he left several books of his own composing full of fine principles of morality which he ingenuously owned were collected from those wise legislators yao and chun the first emperors of china and who lived  00 years before him those books are held at present in the highest esteem and veneration as containing all he could collect of the ancient laws which are looked upon as the most perfect rule of government  the sect of taosse was founded by a philosopher named laokiun or laotse who was born in  0  of the christian era he was librarian to one of the emperors and left a collection of  000 sentences his morality bears a great resemblance to the doctrines of epicurus and consists chiefly in banishing all vehement desires and suppressing impetuous passions his disciples afterward changed his doctrines and said it was possible to discover a liquor that would make the drinker of it immortal this foolish idea led them to the study of chemistry afterward to search for the philosophers stone till at last they were lost in all the wild extravagancies of magic and the weakness of preceding emperors too much encouraged it  the taosse at present offer up three different victims to the spirit they invoke a hog a fish and a bird and follow up their incantations with grimaces and horrible cries some of them in china pretend to be fortune tellers and ridiculously as they act their chief is invested by government with the dignity of grand mandarin which his successors enjoy and he resides in a sumptuous palace in the province of kiangsi the superstitious confidence reposed in him attracts a crowd of followers who flock there for cures from all parts of the empire and to know their fortune and this mandarin distributes small pieces of paper filled with magic characters to all around him who depart satisfied and without regretting the fatigue or expense of these pious pilgrimages  this sect still more pernicious and much wider diffused throughout china than the preceding came originally from india it was introduced by the emperor mingti from a dream he happened to dream one night says history and a sentence which confucius often repeated occurred to his mind viz that the most holy was to be found in the west on this he sent ambassadors into the indies to discover who this saint was and there supposing they had discovered him among the worshippers of the idol fo brought the idol into china and with it the fables wherewith the indian books were filled this was in the   th year of the christian era  the priests attached to the worship of fo are called by the siamese talapoins by the tartars lamas by the chinese hochang and by the japanese bonzes by which latter name they are better known in europe  one of the principal doctrines of this sect is transmigration of which fo appears to have been the inventor as he lived  00 years before pythagoras and as we know that this grecian philosopher traveled through egypt and several parts of india there can scarcely be a doubt of his having borrowed this notion from some of fos disciples another part of their doctrine is the worship of ancestors every chinese keeps in his house a table whereon is written the names of his father grandfather and great grandfather before which they frequently burn incense and prostrate themselves and when the father of a family dies the name of the great grandfather is erased and that of the deceased added to make up the number  i shall not here attempt to examine all the errors of the doctine of fo its folly and absurdity will sufficiently appear if the ideas on which it is founded be only mentioned nothing say they is the beginning and end of all that exists from nothing our first parents sprung and to nothing shall we all return all beings are in fact the same their only difference consists in their qualities and figure the universal principle of which they consist is so subtle simple and pure as to be in reality nothing and to be in a state of rest and obtain happiness we must endeavor by constant meditation and frequent conquest over ourselves to acquire a likeness to this principle and to obtain this end we must accustom ourselves to do nothing will nothing feel nothing and wish for nothing and when we have acquired this state of happy insensibility virtue and vice rewards and punishments providence and immortality are out of the question the nearer a man approaches to the nature of a stone or a log the nearer he is to perfection all holiness consisting in ceasing to exist and being annihilated  can any one believe that a philosophy so absurd would have found partisans in china but so it did and the following are the tenets preached by the bonzes who profess this doctrine they admit of distinction between good and evil and the doctrine of future rewards and punishments they say as christians do of their savior that fo came upon earth to serve mankind and to redeem sinners that by him all sins are expiated and that through him alone they are to have a happy regeneration in the life to come they have five precepts which they enjoin a strict observance of   not to kill any living creature   not to take away the goods of another   not to pollute themselves by uncleanness   not to lie and   not to drink wine but above all they recommend acts of mercy to treat their bonzes well to erect temples and monasteries for them and supply them with every necessary that they may be enabled by their prayers to merit forgiveness for them and a remission of their sins at the funeral of your parents say they burn paper gilt with gold and silver gold and silverstuffs these substances will be changed into real gold and silver and so it is for them in the other world and all these riches will be transmitted to your fathers woe unto you if you obey not these precepts your souls will be delivered over after death to the severest torments and be subjected to the most disgusting changes you shall live again in the form of dogs rats serpents horses and mules and shall be for ever exposed to the most dismal and wretched transmigrations  le comte tells us of one whom the bonzes had persuaded that his soul was to go into one of the emperors posthorses that conveys his dispatches and they had advised him to eat little and endure it patiently and god might be induced the next remove to let him pass into some person of quality but the man was under such horror at being a posthorse that his being a man of figure afterward gave him but little satisfaction he could not sleep day or night his imaginations led him to think he was already in harness and starting at the smack of the postilions whip i awake would he say all in a sweat half frantic not knowing whether he was still a man or metamorphosed into a horse he flew therefore to le comte and begged of him to baptize him and make him a christian that he might not undergo when he died so disagreeable a change  although each family is particularly sollicitous to pay the utmost honor to the idols they think proper to adopt it does not appear that they have any sincere respect for them in cases where they have often prayed for success the patience of their votaries is wearied out and they will make their offerings to other deities others less moderate will treat them roughly kick them about and load them with abusive language thou dog of a spirit will they cry have we not lodged thee in a commodious temple art thou not well gilt well fed and well incensed yet notwithstanding all our care and respect thou art ungrateful enough to refuse us even things that are necessary and with this will tie the idol with cords drag it through the kennels and bespatter it with filth and dirt to punish it for all the perfume they have before lavished on it but if during this scene of frantic folly they should chance to obtain what they pray for they will wash clean and carry back the image with great composure to its niche prostrate themselves before it make the humblest apologies for their rashness and presumption and beg of it forgiveness  le comte entertains us with a story which happened while he resided at nanking a certain man whose only daughter lay dangerously ill having tried all the art of the physicians without effect thought proper to implore the assistance of the gods humbly did he prostrate himself before his idol and offer not only prayers but alms and sacrifice for the recovery of his child the bonzes who benefited by this promised a cure on the part and faith of the idol but promised in vain the girl died and the father to be revenged prosecuted the god in form by laying his case in writing before the judge after having represented in the liveliest terms the deceitful conduct of the unjust divinity he prayed that exemplary punishment might be inflicted on it for its breach of says if the spirit said he had power to cure my daughter it was guilty of fraud in taking my money and suffering her to die if it had not power it was equally as bad to pretend to it by what right then does it assume the character of a god is it for nothing that we adore it and that all the province offers it sacrifice in short he concluded that whether it was want of power or malice in the idol its temple ought to be rased its ministers banished with disgrace and itself punished in its own person  this affair being by the judge considered as important was referred by him to the governor who unwilling to have any thing to do with the gods begged the viceroy to enquire into it he did and finding the bonzes much alarmed advised the complainant to drop the suit telling him it was injudicious to quarrel with this kind of spirits who were naturally revengeful i am afraid continued he that if you carry this matter too far they will play you some bad trick believe me you had much better accommodate the matter with the bonzes they have assured me that the idol will hearken to reason provided you do not provoke it to the contrary  the man oppressed with grief for the loss of his child persisted in his resolution and declared he would rather die than relax in his request i am determined my lord said he the idol may conceive he may commit injustice with impunity because no one will have the courage to attack him but he shall find himself mistaken and we shall soon see which of the two is the most obstinate and malicious  the viceroy finding he could not prevail on the man to give up his point ordered the trial to be brought on the idol not wanting partisans those to whom the bonzes gave money to defend it found its right incontestible and pleaded so strongly for the god that he could not have spoke better for himself but the opponent was a man of much greater penetration and shrewdness and had on his part not been sparing of his money of course purchased as many proofs as were requisite convinced that the devil would be very cunning if he withstood golden arguments and the consequence was a decree was given in his favor the idol was condemned to perpetual banishment as useless in the empire its temple was demolished and the bonzes who represented its person were punished in an exemplary manner  these bonzes or priests are generally men of little or no character and being brought up in idleness devote themselves to this kind of life merely for a maintenance there is no artifice they do not use to extort money from the credulous and the tricks practiced by these pious sharpers often furnish subjects for conversation in china the following extracted from the new memoirs respecting the present sat of china will divert our readers  two of these bonzes perceiving one day in the courtyard of a rich peasant two large ducks sitting before the door began to sigh and weep bitterly the good woman of the house who perceived them from her chamber enquired the cause of their grief we know replied they that the souls of our fathers have passed into the bodies of those ducks and the apprehension of your killing them will kill us very true said the woman we meant to kill them but since you tell me they are your fathers we will preserve them this was not what the bonzes wanted they wanted the ducks  alas returned they your husband may not have that charity and be assured that should any accident happen to them it will prove fatal to us in a word the woman was so affected with their pretended tears that she gave the ducks into their own care which they very respectfully took charge of after twenty prostrations but the same evening put their feathered fathers on the spit and made a hearty meal of them  there is scarce a source of hypocrisy which these fellows are not up to with a design to appear very deserving among the vulgar and to excite a compassion which produces them presents they will affect to put themselves under severe penances and thus expose themselves publicly in the streets some will fasten thick chains  0 feet long about their neck and feet and drag them along the street seemingly in great pain and stop at every house and say see good folks what we suffer for the expiation of your crimes cannot you afford us a trifling alms others will cut their heads with flints and go about all bloody on the same pretense but among all the pretended penances related none exceeds that told by le comte the missionary in his memoires of which he himself was an eyewitness and which he relates in the following words  i met one day in the middle of the village a young brisk bonze whose mildness and modesty in asking charity was very likely to ensure him success he was standing erect in a kind of narrow close chair stuck full in the inside with nails the sharp points of which projected so far and left him so little room that move which way he would they were sure to prick him two men hired for the purpose carried him very gently from house to house and when he was set down he begged compassion  i have said he shut myself up in this place of little ease for the good of your souls and am resolved never to quit it until you have purchased all the nails and their number was about  000 each nail is worth sixpence but there is none of them but will prove a source of blessings to you and yours if you buy but one it will purchase a happiness and be an act of heroic virtue and the alms you thus bestow will not be given to the bonzes to whom you may otherwise bestow your charity but to the god fo in honor of whom we are building a temple  at that time i was passing by the bonze saw me and addressed me as he did the rest i told him he was much in the wrong to torment himself so uselessly in this world and advised him to leave his prison to go to the temple of the true god be there instructed in heavenly truths and submit to a penance less severe and more salutary  he thanked me very mildly and calmly for my advice but told me he should be much more obliged to me if i would buy a dozen of his nails which would certainly procure me a safe and pleasant journey here said he turning himself on one side take these upon the faith of a bonze they are the best in my chair because they give me most pain but they are all of the same price he uttered these words with an air and action that at another time would have made me laugh but at this it excited my compassion to see this wretched captive of the devil suffering more to destroy his soul than a christian is obliged to endure to be saved  all bonzes indeed are not so industrious for many will renounce these painful means of getting alms but to attain the same end will sometimes go to the extremity of committing murder some years ago says le comte the governor of a city passing along the highway with his customary train saw a large crowd assembled and found on enquiry that the bonzes were celebrating a festival they had constructed on a large scaffold or theater a very high machine at the top of which a young man put forth his head above a small ballustrade that surrounded it nothing could be seen but his head and of this only his eyes seemed at liberty which he rolled about with an apparent phrenzy a little lower on this scaffolding an old bonze was explaining to the crowd the sacrifice which the young man above was going to make of his life by throwing himself into a deep stream which ran by the highwayside he will not die said this bonze because he must be received at the bottom of the waters by the charitable spirits who will hasten to protect him in a word it will be the greatest happiness that can befall him a hundred other persons have offered to supply his place but his zeal piety and virtues have given him the preference the mandarin having heard this tale said the young man showed wonderful courage he should like to talk with him and begged he might be brought down to him the old bonze frightened at this request immediately opposed it protesting that all would be lost if the victim only opened his mouth and that he could not answer for the mischief that might thence arise to the province the evil you fear said the mandarin i will take upon myself bring him down the young man hearing this made a noise and rolled his eyes about see said the bonze his agitation and his looks your honor will drive him to despair and he will expire with grief the mandarin firm to his resolves ordered his attendants to mount the scaffold and bring him down by force they immediately obeyed and found him bound and gagged as soon as he was released and able to speak he cried ah my lord grant me vengeance on these assassins who intended to drown me i am a bachelor going to court to attend the customary examinations and these bonzes seized me yesterday and this morning bound me to this machine in the manner you found me before break of day determining to throw me into the water in the evening and to perform their abominable mysteries at the expense of my life  as soon as he began to speak the bonzes fled but the officers of justice who always make part of a governors train soon overtook some of them their chief was immediately thrown into the river and drowned and the rest were conducted to prison and afterward punished a they deserved  a letter of father laureati an italian jesuit gives us a story of a different kind but equally descriptive of the villainy of these men near the city of foutcheou there was formerly a famous pagod inhabited by the most distinguished bonzes of the province the daughter of a chinese doctor who was going in a covered chair accompanied by two female attendants to her fathers country house had the curiosity to see this temple and sent to beg of the bonzes that they would retire until she had said her prayers the chief bonze desirous of seeing this young lady secreted himself behind the altar he had no sooner beheld her than he was smitten with her charms and became so desperately enamoured that all thoughts of danger vanished and he conceived it would be very easy to carry off a feeble woman so badly attended accordingly he ordered some other bonzes his confidants to lay hold of her attendants whilst he forced the young lady to satisfy his brutal desires in spite of all her cries and tears  the father did not long remain ignorant of the cause of his daughters absence he knew she had entered the pagoda and had then disappeared and required that she should be restored and on the bonzes declaring that she left the temple as soon as she had said her prayers the father applied to the tartargeneral of the province and demanded justice against the ravishers of his daughter the bonzes relying on the credulity of the father and the governor informed them that the god fo having fallen in love with her had carried her off and the delinquent took pains to persuade the father that he and his family were highly honored by this distinguished mark of the gods respect but the tartargeneral had too much sense to be amused with such fables he resolved to search the pagoda and whilst he was prying into every recess heard some confused cries which seemed to proceed from the bottom of a rock he immediately advanced toward the place and perceived an irongate shut leading to a grotto having ordered it to be broke open he descended into a subterranean apartment where he found the young lady and above  0 other females who had been confined in that dismal abode the governor after having relieved them set fire to the four corners of the edifice and destroyed in the same flames the temple altars and gods with their infamous ministers  notwithstanding the infatuation of the people in favor of popular superstition the bonzes are held in contempt for springing from the very refuse of the people they are in general but fanatical impostors to perpetuate this sect they purchase young children and bring them up to their own mind and after all are ignorant even of their faith though they are under no regular hierarchy they have superiors among them some collect alms and some acquiring literary knowledge are commissioned to visit the literati and the houses of the great and old men rendered venerable by years intermix with the women and preside at their religious assemblies  these assemblies or clubs consist of from    to  0 ladies of rank when widows or advanced in life one of them is elected superior for a year and at her house these meetings are held where they have a kind of chapel on commondays when these female devotees are assembled such an aged bonze enters and sings several anthems to the god fo and after repeatedly singing omito fo and dinging on the bottom of several small kettles which they beat they place themselves at tables and finish their noisy devotion with mirth and a good repast  but on days of greater solemnity their place of worship is ornamented with a number of idols one of which is the idol of immortality and represented by a very fat man sitting crosslegged with a great naked belly such as we have often seen in chinaware in england and a variety of paintings under a hundred different forms exhibiting the various punishments inflicted on the wicked in hell a grand or superior bonze is at this time invited who attends with a whole train of ministers and the prayer and feasting continues for seven days one of the great businesses of this day is to prepare and consecrate treasures for the other world to this purpose they erect a small edifice with paper painted and gilt resembling a house and being finished with great care and accuracy they supply it with every piece of useful furniture found in the houses of the opulent and fill it with a great number of boxes in which they deposit pieces of gilt paper as ingots of gold and silver a hundred of these small boxes are designed to redeem those sinners from the dreadful punishments of the infernal king who have nothing to give twenty are also put aside to bribe the officers of the tribunal of this king of shadows the house is for lodging and boarding in the other world where they each hope to buy some office or public establishment the whole of these imaginary riches being put into their respective boxes are secured by a paper lock the house or palacedoor is then secured when the person who has fitted up this toy happens to die the paperhouse and it contents are burnt at the grave with great formality in order that the soul of the deceased may take out the treasure which they conceive will be then converted into realities and enable it to make its peace with the king of terrors at these times the priests who think differently are not satisfied with papermoney but expect to be seed with that which is more substantial  thus is china become a prey to all sorts of ridiculous and extravagant opinions and though some of the learned oppose these sects treat them as heresies and have sometimes inclined the court to exterminate them throughout the empire yet such inclinations have been attended with no effect either through a fear of exciting commotions among the people or because they have had secret favorers and protectors among the learned themselves  the learned of modern times have established a sect of their own these give the first principle of all things the name of taiki which they say is impossible to be explained being distinct from matter and of course they have no terms to explain it by however they compare it to the ridge of a house that unites the roof to the root of a tree to the axletree of a chariot to a kingdom in which all things live and affirm it to be the basis of every thing they hold it to be eternal infinite perfect and the essence of all other beings but some of the missionaries have been persuaded that all the learned in the empire are atheists and there is scarce an individual but what forms imaginary deities of his own every city of china is filled with fortune tellers who are generally blind people that play on a lute and go about from house to house to tell fortunes for a small piece of money there are other people who consult oracles respecting transactions they are about to perform and these oracles or kind of magic are managed by the priests and there are others as extravagant in opinion as the human mind is capable of inventing these are called fongchoui which signifies wind and water or the lucky and unlucky situation of a house or other building if close to the house of one of these men a neighbor has built another but on a different plan should the angle formed by its roof stand in a particular direction it is enough to occasion utter ruin and destruction and the proprietor of the first house lives ever after in terror conceiving that he and his posterity will be continually exposed to the malign influence of this unlucky angle the erection of the new building becomes the epoch of universal hatred between the two families and perhaps ends in a lawsuit and when a judicial process can give no relief the only alternative left is for the proprietor of the first house to place the figure of a devouring dragon on his roof with his mouth directed to the hated angle and form an opinion that this dragon will from time to time devour its malignity his apprehensions of ill luck will begin to subside and tranquillity be in some measure restored to the family  the governor of kientchang took this wise method to secure himself from the jesuits church which having been built on an eminence overlooked his palace he did not however depend entirely on the protection of this tutelary dragon but altered the position of his principal apartments raising at the distance of  00 paces from the church a kind of large facade three stories high the better to break the influence of the tientchutang or temple of the lord of heaven it unluckily happened that the death of the governors successor was attributed to this facade the mandarin was attacked by an astmatic complaint he spit up a phlegm of a white color which was owing they said to the walls of the facade being painted white they were therefore daubed over with black in hopes of producing a contrary effect but in vain he died and it was concluded that the painting of the walls black was not done soon enough  i should never have done was i to relate all the stories that are told of this kind there are some men who follow no other profession than pointing out mountains hills and other places that have an aspect favorable for buryingplaces aad when a chinese is persuaded of the truth of such information there is no sum that he would not sacrifice to purchase it from a conviction in his own mind that all the happiness of his life will depend upon it such is their infatuation and such their superstition that if this or that person is endowed with a greater share of genius if he is fortunate in life rises rapidly to the degree of doctor is promoted to the rank of superior mandarin blessed with a numerous family has less sickness than others and is more successful in trade it is not owing to knowledge activity or honesty but only to a lucky fongchoui because his houses and the buryingplaces of his ancestors are happily situated  the study of letters being the high road to dignities and it being open to persons of all degrees there must needs be many of mean extraction brought up in idolatry and when they become mandarins either through the prejudice of their education or a public complaisance to the people and to maintain the public tranquillity seem to adopt the opinions of every different sect and the rather because the chinese of all ranks seldom look any further than the present life the mandarins who are living deities of the country have seldom any god but their fortune and this being liable to several troublesome vicissitudes their principal care is to avoid misfortunes and keep themselves safe in their posts the students who may be considered as the lesser nobility have nothing at heart but a certain honor which consists in succeeding in their examinations and in raising themselves to the highest degree merchants think of nothing from morning to night but their business and the rest of the people are entirely taken up in procuring a livelihood which consists in a small quantity of rice and pulse in this manner is all the time of the chinese taken up religion with them being only a secondary thought  the emperor being a tartar follows the idolatry of his own nation which does not differ much from that of the chinese except it be that they worship a living man whom they style lama which le comte says is the same with the god fo only worshipped under a sensible figure i have dwelt a good deal upon this religion when i was speaking of the tartars throughout siberia this lama receives here the title of eternal father and all the eastern tartars have the highest veneration for him he is shown in a dark place in his palace illuminated with lamps he sits crosslegged on a cushion raised above the ground dressed in the richest robes and all that approach him fall prostrate and kiss his feet he is of such authority that no king is crowned till he has made rich presents to this pretended deity and implored his blessing his residence is at barantola where he holds a court like a king but does not meddle with secular government and may properly be styled the tartars pope  since a tartarprince has been seated on the throne of china the priests of this great lama who are also called lamas serve as chaplains to the tartarnobility living at peking the emperor himself for reasons of state shows both lamas and bonzes a particular respect but the jesuits observe that he is no slave to their faith that he sees through the folly of it and laughs in private at their extravagant fables but it is acknowledged that the emperor still pays those honors to confucius that others do and sacrifices in the heathen temples and though the jesuits would have us believe that he adores only the supreme lord of the universe and that nothing but reasons of state prevent his embracing christianity yet they acknowledge at other times that he assures them he cannot believe the christian religion that whatever difficulties there are in it if he was convinced of the truth of it he would not delay a moment to embrace it and that if he became a christian the whole empire would soon follow his example  through the favor of the late emperor the christian religion gained such ground that they had  00 churches and chapels very well filled with converts but these are of the poorer sort christianity making but slow progress amongst the wealthy they had also when le comte was there three bishops appointed by the king of portugal who claims a right to the churches in the east one of these bishops was at peking one at nanking and one at macoa the better sort of people are not only offended at the doctrine of the trinity and incarnation but the magistrates and opulent are so universally given up to cheating and extortion by which they acquire estates that the roman catholic doctrine of restitution does not agree with them parting with their women is another great objection to their embracing the christian faith and to preach to the women to live with one man when their husbands have an absolute power over them and can sell and transfer them from one to another as often as they please seems to very little purpose however the missionaries assure us that they converted above  0000 in the space of a very few years were protestant preachers to be sent amongst them in all likelihood they would better succeed for though the jesuits have been very complaisant to the chinese in many instances and winked at their worship to confucius and their deceased parents yet they rigorously exact their putting away all their wives and concubines but one as a necessary qualification to their admittance into the christian faith which is with them such a difficulty that they cannot get over it it being contrary to the laws and customs of the country to put away a wife but for some misdemeanour and the relations of the woman would demand justice upon such an occasion but it would also be hard to separate children from their several mothers which must be done in this case or the father must part with the children too and commit the education of them to strangers  as for the women it is not conceivable what effect this doctrine has upon them one who had no other objection to christianity very well replied to a certain father on this occasion  sir i belong to a mandarin who bought me if i leave him he has a right to follow me bring me back again and make a slave of me but supposing i could avoid his pursuit where could i fly my relations who sold me dare not harbor me and i should infallibly fall into the hands of some other person who would keep me in the state i seek to avoid i must therefore remain in the house where i am and how shall i be able to resist a brutish fellow who consults only his lust and will be justified by the laws and example of the whole empire it will be to no purpose to lay before him the holiness of christianity which i desire to embrace neither my tears nor my entreaties nor even the most obstinate resistance i can make will be able to hinder him  so that the missionaries themselves check the increase of that faith they wish to propagate by proposing impossibilities which surely the divine goodness cannot countenance nor can it enter into the heart of man to believe that our savior himself would have refused such a proselyte who in all other instances was sincere  but as all the great men in the empire will certainly remain averse to christianity if nothing less than parting with their women will satisfy the jesuits so on the other hand the women will infallibly promote it to the utmost of their power that every one may have her man to herself and be a little more on a level with our sex were the interest of the ladies as good in that part of the world as it is here the jesuits would need no supernatural assistance to carry their point it is very unfortunate for the jesuits that that they can scarce have any opportunity of approaching the fairsex whatever purity or selfdenial they may preach or practice the chinese understand human nature too well to suffer the most mortified of them to converse tete a tete with their wives for these surly men will not trust their women even in a church with the men  such was the state of christianity when le comte was there but we understand since that the emperor disliking the conduct of the missionaries has banished them all and overthrown their churches so the christian religion is losing ground daily  among the many religions in china there are not wanting jews and the discovery of a synagogue in an empire so remote is a circumstance too interesting to be here omitted this jewish colony appeared in china in the year  0  before christ and has continued ever since though at present it is reduced to a small number of families established at caifong the capital of the province of honan as we are indebted to f gozani a jesuit missionary for the first knowledge of these chinese jews we shall give the account from him  these jews consisted when gozani was there of only seven families he paid them a visit hoping to find the old testament among them they have a synagogue and a variety of religious books i compared my bible says gozani with theirs and found the most exact conformity between both these jews here are called tiaokinkiao and still preserve several of the ceremonies mentioned in the old testament such as circumcision which they say originated from abraham the feast of unleavened bread that of the pascal lamb in commemoration of their departure from egypt and of their passage through the red sea and the sabbath and other festivals prescribed by the ancient law  these families form alliances with each other and never mix with the hoeihoei or mahomedans to whom they bear no resemblance either in their books or religious ceremonies their synagogue is something like our european churches being divided into three aisles that in the middle like the choir is occupied by the table of incense the chair of moses and the    tabernacles constructed in the form of an arch containing    copies of the pentateuch the two other aisles are set apart as places of prayer within the building is a passage which runs quite round it these jews render homage to confucius as the literati do and assist them in the solemn ceremonies performed in halls dedicated to their great men and in spring and autumn practice certain rites in honor of their ancestors as do the chinese but do not present them with the flesh of hogs having in their hall of ancestors neither tables nor images  they told gozani that their ancestors came from a kingdom of the west called the kingdom of judah which joshua conquered after they had left egypt had crossed the red sea and traversed the desert and that the number of jews who departed from egypt amounted to  00000 men they spoke to him of the book of judges and of david solomon and ezekiel who raised up dry bones and of jonas who was three days and three nights in the whales belly etc which plainly shows that they have besides the pentateuch several other parts of the sacred writings they informed him that their alphabet was composed of    letters but that they generally used only    which agrees with st jeromes account who says that the hebrews have    letters five of which are double  these jews neither kindle fire nor dress any victuals on saturday but prepare their saturdays food on friday when they read the bible in their synagogue they cover their faces with a transparent veil in remembrance of moses who came down from the mountain covered and in that manner published the decalogue  when gozani spoke to them of the messiah promised in the holy scripture they appeared much surprised but when he told them that the messiah was called jesus they replied that mention was made in their bible of a holy man named jesus the son of sirach but they were wholly unacquainted with the new jesus of whom he spoke  the mahomedans have multiplied much more in china than the jews it is above  00 years since they first entered this country in which they have formed different establishments for a great number of years they were preserved only by marriages and by alliances which they made but for some time past they have increased their number by purchasing a great number of pagan children and bringing them up in the principles of their religion during a famine in changtong when parents of families were distressed for food they bought more than  0000 children for whom when grown up they procured wives and built houses so that they formed whole villages of them these insensibly increased and are now become so numerous that they entirely exclude from those places where they reside every inhabitant who does not believe in their prophet and frequent a mosque  chap xiv of their language the chinese language is not only one of the most ancient in the world but has the advantage of being still a living one and there is every probability to believe that this language has for  000 years and upwards remained always and invariably the same china never having changed its inhabitants never borrowed any thing from foreign nations and it being universally admitted that the first chapters of their canonical book called chouking were written in the reign of yao   00 years before the christian era or at the latest under that of you several speeches of the first emperors are there related verbatim which agree with the language now spoken and chinese players act dramatic pieces written  000 years ago two songs have been preserved which were composed in the reign of yao one of which for the antiquitys sake i will lay before my readers  when the sun begins its course i betake myself to work and when he sinks below the horizon i fall into the arms of sleep i slake my thirst with water from my own well and feed on the fruits of my own fields  what therefore can i gain or lose by the power of the emperor  the chinese tongue has no relation whatever with any known language and is such that no laws of analogy can comprehend it it has no alphabet every word that composes it is a monosyllable and expressed by a single character and rich as this language is in expression it has but   0 radical or primary words but we shall have a different notion of it when we find that the sense of these primary words may be multiplied almost without end by the variety of accents inflections aspirations and points used like the hebrew and by other changes of the voice these accents so fugitive are however very sensible to the ear of a chinese who catches them very readily as a frenchman does leau los lots which strike the ears of an englishman or a german with the same sound  the union and combination of the chinese monosyllables is another cause of their great multiplication by such a combination a chinese can express every thing mou for example signifies a tree or wood but when joined to other words acquires a new sense thus mouleao implies wood prepared for building moulan wooden bars mouhia a box mousiang a press moutsiang a carpenter moueul a mushroom mounu a kind of small orange mousing the planet jupiter moumien cotton etc  gai implies love jegai ardent love tsegai parental love kinggai respectful love kigai blind love etc in short there are more than  00 different modifications of this single word gai by this combination of words the chinese have names for every thing that exists words that express every circumstance or quality of a thing and point out the smallest difference in that thing thus instead of these six words calf heifer steer cow bull ox in chinese they have not only these but a multitude of others which express the different years of their ages their distinction and the different varieties in color figure and fruitfulness of these animals and so on  this is quite sufficient to give an idea of their language to enter further into it would require a separate work as to the characters used to express the several words there are more than eighty thousand of them and the greater part of the literati spend their whole lives in learning them  chap xv of their literature when we view the immense number of libraries in china elegantly built beautifully adorned and furnished with a valuable collection of books when we consider the prodigious number of graduates and colleges established in every city throughout the empire and when we further consider that men are there never preferred but in proportion to their literary talents that the most exalted situations are acquired only by study that none have been governors of cities and provinces or have enjoyed offices about the court but the learned and that for upwards of  000 years one would naturally imagine that china must be superior to every other country in literature and learning  this however is by no means the case for though the chinese are allowed to have a great deal of knowledge that knowledge is not very intuitive penetrating or inventive nor have any of the speculative sciences been brought to any perfection amongst them  logic which in europe is much refined is void of all rules among the chinese their rhetoric is merely natural and imitative having no method or art of embellishing discourse their eloquence does not consist in an arrangement of periods or an harmonious flow of words but entirely in expressions bold metaphors and a happy application of the maxims and sentences of their ancient sages who express a variety of thoughts in a very few words they never address the emperor but in petitions memorials and remonstrances which are void of every superfluous ornament every useless expression every weak argument every ambiguous quotation and every equivocal proof study day and night says one of their best authors to write ten characters of a remonstrance and of these erase six the thunderbolts of the throne fly in every direction a single syllable is sufficient to rouse them and they may carry death and destruction to the remotest corner of the empire  but on particular occasions such as academical discourses written for degrees etc they will vary their general mode and sometimes to show their abilities will display highsounding words without meaning thoughts which have more brilliancy than truth embellished with all the tinsel of chinese fancy but such writers are distinguished by the names of kiukeou mouche golden mouths and wooden tongues  chinese rhetoricians reckon a great number of different kinds of eloquence so many as to leave us astonished at their having been able to establish such a variety of shades in the art of persuading for the information of my readers i will enumerate some few of the principal  the force and ornament of truth they call the eloquence of things  the emanation or effusion of the orators soul the eloquence of sentiment and conviction  the eloquence of candor and innocence with them is that which banishes doubt and suspicion  the eloquence of connection and combination is the fruit of long study and meditation  the eloquence of boldness spares nothing and conceals nothing  the eloquence of wonder subdues reason by the powers of imagination  the eloquence of singularity and astonishment contradicts received truths and seduces by leading to discoveries  the eloquence of illusion and artifice effects a change by diverting the attention overpowers the heart by a melting pathos  the eloquence of metaphysics and subtleties is wrapped up in obscurities and imposes on the weak by confounding them with things past comprehension  the eloquence of the old language affects to imitate the tone of the ancients and derives force from their authority  the eloquence of grandeur and majesty rises by the strength of genius to the sublimity of the king a code of moral laws   the eloquence of images pleases like the flowers  the eloquence of abundance and rapidity lays open reasons accumulates proofs and multiplies authorities  the eloquence of softness and insinuation is to the mind what the light of the moon is to the eyes  the eloquence of depth is that which produces reflection by the extent importance and majesty of the truths to the discovery of which it appears only to conduct  the eloquence of mystery exhibits things partially and engages and pleases by awakening the curiosity and  superficial eloquence shines without enlightening etc  in short the chinese have a still greater variety and have as many kinds of style as of eloquence but yet they seem not fond of animated declamation and in their oratory never use those expressive gestures and that powerful modulation of voice that captivates the eye and ear and so often contributes to the success of our public discourses they think like the savage illinois who were firmly persuaded that their missionary had fallen into a passion because he concluded his sermon with a few pathetic sentences delivered after the european manner they labor to convince by addressing the understanding only in short a chinese orator desirous of making any impression on his hearers endeavors to affect little by little and this is best brought about by appearing to be really affected himself it is not by its cries says a chinese writer it is by its flight that the wild duck makes the rest depart and guides them through the air  the knowledge of astronomy may be traced back in china even to the foundation of the empire in the time of yao whose reign began      years before the christian era they had mathematicians in china who formed a calendar by the emperors orders they were then acquainted with the motion of the sun moon and planets and their almanacks told the same things then as ours do now their astronomical year began on the   st of december which is the winter solstice but their civil year rested on the determination of the emperor those almanacks at present made and published for the use of the people are filled with superstitious predictions and all the nonsensical dreams of judicial astrology  at peking there is established a tribunal of astronomy one of the most important offices of which is the observation of eclipses they are to acquaint the emperor of all the particulars respecting these phenomena some months before they happen notice of which is transmitted by him into all the provinces of the empire the ancient opinion of the chinese was that during the time of an eclipse of the sun or moon they were attacked by a celestial dragon as i have had occasion to mention before and though the learned and people of distinction are now quite free from this ancient prejudice and are persuaded that eclipses are owing to natural causes yet custom has such a prevalence over them that they will not leave off their ancient ceremonies which are general throughout the empire  on the day of the eclipses therefore the mandarins of all the different orders receive notice to appear in their proper dresses and with all the badges of their dignity in the court of the tribunal of astronomy and there to wait till the eclipse takes place each of them carries in his hand a sheet of the paper which contains a figure of the eclipse and every circumstance attending it as soon as they perceive the sun or moon begins to be darkened they all throw themselves on their knees and knock their foreheads against the earth a frightful noise of drums and cymbals immediately succeeds throughout the city this being the remains of an ancient opinion that by such horrid din they assisted the suffering luminary and prevented its being devoured by the dragon   see the plate of this p  0 vol iv at peking there is a very fine observatory with noble instruments and apparatus fit for the observatory of a prince the celestial globe is six feet in diameter and though it weighs  000lb is so well hung that any child may turn it  they have no clocks or watches in china but what are brought from europe but they have sundials and reckon their time almost as we do the hours of the day and night in towns are sounded by bells on which persons are stationed to strike  the calendar or almanac when made and published is first presented to the emperor it is by his order then distributed to the princes lords and great officers in every province and by them to all subordinate officers this done it is reprinted for the people no other than this approved calendar can be printed under pain of death this presenting of the calendar to the emperor is annually made with a great deal of ceremony all the mandarins of peking appear early in the morning at the palace in their proper habits and the calendars intended for the emperor and empress are on large paper covered with yellow satin and enclosed in cloth of gold they are placed on a large gilded machine in the form of a pyramid and carried by  0 footmen in yellow liveries this is followed by    other similar machines of a smaller size surrounded with red curtains on which are placed the calendars for the princes of the blood these are bound in red satin and enclosed in cloth of silver immediately after follow several tables covered with red carpets on which are carried the calendars of the grandees the generals of the army and other officers of the crown covered with yellow cloth  the porters who quit their loads at the last gate of the great hall and place the tables on each side of the passage leave nothing in the middle but the machine that comes with the imperial calendars from which the mandarins take the calendars and place them on a table covered with yellow brocade within the hall prostrating themselves three times and then delivering them to the intendants of the palace for the emperor  each prince sends his chief officer to the imperial palace where he receives on his knees the calendar for his royal master and those for the mandarins of his household which amount to    or   00 for the court of every prince afterward the lords and generals of the army and the mandarins of all the tribunals appear and receive on their knees a calendar each from the astronomical mandarins  after this distribution every one returns in his rank to the hall and turning himself toward the most inward part of the palace at a signal given falls on his knees and bows three times to the ground after three genuflexions and nine profound reverences with the head he returns to his own house  following the example of the court the governors and mandarins of the several provinces receive the calendar in the same manner in each capital city according to their ranks as for the people there are none of them so poor but they will buy a calendar every year such purchase being a declaration of loyalty to their sovereign a nonpurchase would be looked on as an act of disaffection  though they are not ignorant of arithmetic they add and subtract by means of an instrument called souanpan which consists of a small board crossed from the top to the bottom having  0 or    parallel wires with a separation in the middle little ivory balls are strung on these wires on which they slip up and down the two on the upper wire stand each for five units and the five below for single units  they reckon much in the same manner in joining and separating the balls as we do with counters but with so much facility and quickness that they can keep pace with a man who is reading a book of accounts and can cast up the most considerable sums in less time than europeans with the use of figures  the souanpan   as we have spoken of their theatric representations it is natural to suppose they are acquainted with the drama but they have no rules for dramatic composition nor do they make any distinction between tragedy and comedy each performer when he enters begins by telling his name and the character he is going to support and the same actor often performs several parts in one piece female parts are performed by boys  chinese tragedies are interspersed with several pieces of singing in those parts where the performer is supposed to be agitated most he breaks off his declamation and begins to sing accompanied with instruments  voltaire borrowed the subject of his tragedy which murphy has since translated under the name of the orphan of china from a chinese tragedy called the orphan of tchao which was translated from the chinese by the missionary premare and which was among a hundred of the best theatrical pieces composed in the fourteenth century but the chinese literati seldom employ their talents in this species of composition  neither do they turn their thoughts to poetry this study being seldom pursued but from taste or to fill up a vacant hour when a chinese speaking of a man of letters says he has a talent of making good verses he means to speak of him as we would of a captain of dragoons by saying he is an excellent performer on the violin a taste for poetry is however pretty general in china and their art in this polite literature differs very little from the manner of horace and boileau but as a chinese poet has not the same resources as europeans in the attracting fictions of ancient mythology they supply the deficiency by bold and ingenious metaphors and using the names of several animals in an allegorical sense thus supplying the place of jupiter mars mercury etc the eagle they call  the host of the clouds the jackdaw the bird of speech the head the sanctuary of reason the eyes the stars of the forehead and so on but to give a clearer idea of their poetry i will transcribe part of a poem written by the emperor kienlong who had been  0 years on the throne of china and was one of the most accomplished scholars and best poets of the age it was translated into french by a missionary in    0 and in english is as follows  after delineating all the natural beauties which distinguish the country of his ancestors and describing the prospect which the sea exhibits in the gulf of leatong he proceeds to celebrate the mountains that surround the city of monkden thus   mountains by you i begin  mountain of iron embroidered mountain to direct the paths of the traveller do thou present thyself at so remote a distance  to suspend his fatigue and cheer his sight do thou exhibit a form and colors so singular  thou art a certain mark to point out the route he ought to pursue in order to reach without interruption the goal of his repose  shall i exhibit thee in that point of view wherein thou appearest majestically beautiful and enchanting or in that wherein thou inspirest sadness mingled with terror  no to name thee only is sufficient to make thee known  in vain should i attempt to describe those amphitheatres covered with delightful verdure with which your sides are eternally crowned those charming views that form at a distance an almost insensible declivity over which the ravished eye wanders with endless delight those clustered mounts which from space to space give birth to each other those crystal streams which pouring down in an infinity of cascades hasten through different channels to unite their waters in the plain and thence to form rivers rivulets and a thousand rills in vain should i attempt to describe those lofty and thick ridges which at a distance hide the light of the sun during day and the brightness of the moon during night those proud summits which after having pierced the clouds still stretch toward the wide expanse of heaven  my attempt would be equally vain did i endeavor to delineate those gloomy caverns those enormous fissures those pointed rocks those hideous precipices which cannot be approached without awe those dangerous clefts which create terror and those profound gulphs which the eye cannot behold but with horror what language however expressive  what pencil however bold  can sketch out  can even pourtray  a part of thy soft enchanting beauties equally awful and alike sublime  they are beyond expression  it is by viewing them only that we can form an idea of them  if the beauties which distinguish thee are contrasted by objects which seem in our sight to degrade thee it is because thou art not wholly destined for the use of man  the wild animals which press the earth with their feet the reptiles that creep the fowls that cleave the air in thee find nourishment and shelter children of nature of that benevolent mother who watches over all they claim an equal right to her protection  open then o mountains open for them your bosoms let your caverns and precipices afford a retreat to the most ferocious among them let your hollow and steep rocks be a concealment for others be an asylum to all multiply your productions to nourish them and let your limpid streams distill to quench their thirst man is not jealous he will admire you the more  were we to credit the chinese they were the first inventors of music and who formerly brought it to the greatest perfection if this be true they are greatly degenerated for with them it is at present so imperfect that it is unworthy the name they seem however to regret the loss of their ancient harmony as we do that of the greeks and egyptians which has been so much extolled by antiquity and of which so many wonderful things have been related if egypt had a hermes who by the softness and charms of his voice humanized mankind  if greece had an amphion at the harmony of whose voice cities rose into being or an orpheus who by the sound of his lyre could suspend the course of rivers and make the rocks to follow him  china boasts of a lyaglun a kouei and a pinmoukia who by a touch of their kin and their che produced sounds that softened the hearts of men and tamed the most ferocious of animals  father amiot applied himself with the utmost study to learn the musical system of the ancient chinese and discovered that before pythagoras or even mercury himself the division of the octave into    semitones was known in china and that from the remotest ages of antiquity they had in their scale only five tones corresponding to our fa sol la ut re and two others answering to our mi and do and he is of opinion that the greeks and pythagoras himself did nothing but apply that theory to strings which the chinese had before formed and applied to pipes but whether or not the chinese have the honor of being the first inventors as i have said they are now very much in this science below other nations they are ignorant of musical notes and have no signs to describe the diversity of tones the rising or falling of the voice and the rest of those variations that constitute harmony the airs which they sing or play are only got by rote and are learnt by the ear notwithstanding which they frequently compose new ones  music with them is seldom heard but at plays feasts weddings and such like occasions their concerts have no dependence on the variety of tones or difference of parts they all sing the same air as is practiced throughout the other parts of asia they have invented eight kinds of musical instruments which they think have the nearest resemblance to a human voice some are of stone others of metal like our bells and one amongst the rest is not unlike our trumpet they have also others made of skins like our drums they likewise make use of stringed instruments but the strings are of silk these are the cymbals that blind people play on as also their violins each of which has but three strings they have also windinstruments of two or three kinds resembling our flutes and a small species of organ the sound of which is not disagreeable but they are the only nation who have had the ingenuity to apply stones to the making of musical instruments i have already mentioned their sonorous stones and the instrument constructed of them is called a king which consists of an assortment of    stones formed like our carpenters square and suspended by the angles as we now suspend our musical bells which stones they strike in the same manner  chinese music   their windinstruments are made with the bamboo in a variety of forms composed of pipes joined together or separate and pierced with holes more or less the principal windinstrument they have is formed of a gourd and a number of bamboopipes the neck of the gourd being cut off it is covered with a piece of wood in which several holes of different diameters are bored into each of these holes a bamboopipe shorter or longer is fixed in order to vary the tones and another pipe is like the handle of a pipkin introduced into the side below the woodcover which when applied to the mouth conveys the air to all the pipes it contains father pereira who was a tolerable musician as the emperor played an air pricked it down in european notes and immediately played it himself which so struck the emperor with astonishment that he could scarce believe his eyes and ears not comprehending how a stranger could learn a piece of music so quickly that had cost so much time and labor to his musicians to learn  having mentioned their music i will say a few words of their painting though not immediately connected with their literature yet if it be considered that painting speaks to the eye as oratory paints to the ear there is a great analogy between writing and painting  chinese painting has long been decried in europe  but why because we have seen none of their best performances they pretend to have had their le brun their le sueur and their mignard and at present have painters among them who are held in high estimation their works are never carried to canton and of course never fall into the hands of europeans who are fond only of naked figures of licentious and indecent subjects and who prevail on the daubers of canton to execute pieces for them the obscenity of which may gratify the taste and tickle the fancy of a european voluptuary  had my readers seen the paintings from which the engravings in this volume are copied they would have a better opinion of chinese painting than they have hitherto had  they excel chiefly in plants and flowers and are so accurate in describing them that they will not fail to express the different shades of the leaves growing on two stems having the same flowers when the one shall be fullblown and the other only breaking through the bud and no person is astonished in china to hear a painter ask his pupil how many scales there are between the head of a carp and it is tail  painting however makes but little progress in china it is reckoned among the frivolous arts but the emperors cabinets and galleries are filled with european paintings and he has in his park a european village painted in fresco which produces the most agreeable deception the remaining part of the wall represents a landscape and little hills which are so happily blended with the distant mountains behind that it is almost impossible to conceive any composition more ingeniously imagined or better executed this beautiful work is the production of chinese painters from designs sketched out for them indeed fresco painting was known in china long before the christian era  engraving in a variety of colors is very ancient among the chinese but their statuary is nothing to speak of there is not a statue in all the squares or public edifices of peking nor in the emperors palace what few statues there are ornament the avenues to the tombs of princes  with respect to their architecture indifferent as it is it is not without its principles its rules and proportions and though it has no relation whatever to eutopean architecture nor has borrowed any thing from the greeks has a certain beauty peculiar to itself the mansions of the emperor are real palaces and by the immensity symmetry height regularity and magnificence of the numberless buildings which compose them announce in a striking manner the majesty and greatness of the master who inhabits them the louvre at paris would occupy but a very small space in one of the numerous courts of the imperial palace at peking  all the houses and buildings of china are of wood not owing to a scarcity of stone or marble for they have such abundance of the latter that many cities are paved with marble of all colors nor to the difficulty of transporting it for all the emperors gardens are interspersed with enormous artificial rocks the foundations of all his palaces consist of immense blocks both of marble and alabaster and the steps of all the stairs however high or broad are all of one piece it is the dread of earthquakes that prevents their building with marble and the great heat in the southern provinces and extreme cold in the northern ones making such marble sweat would render houses built with it unwholesome and almost uninhabitable during winter at peking the cold is so exceedingly sharp and severe that no window fronting the north can be opened and water continues constantly frozen to the depth of    inches for more than three months together  the same reasons operate against their building houses with more than one story as a second or third story would not be habitable in such cold weather or during the great heats in summer for though peking is situated more to the north than the rest of the empire the heat there during the dog days is so intolerably scorching that the police obliges tradesmen and shopkeepers to sleep in the piazzas of their houses lest they should be stifled in the interior apartments  when the court resided in the southern provinces the greater part of these palaces which former emperors erected in their gardens were built with different stories and their taste for this manner of building was carried to that length that edifices were erected from   0 to  00 feet in height and the pavilions at their extremities were sometimes  00 feet but the emperors became disgusted at this aerial architecture and lowered their palaces even before the court was removed to peking however to preserve the remembrance of it there are some few buildings belonging to the emperor still standing several stories high  the only thing that remains to be spoken of is their practice of physic the study of which is coeval with their empire their physicians were never skilful anatomists or profound philosophers but they are and always have been such able practitioners as to astonish the most skilful in europe  vital heat and radical moisture are with them the two natural principles of life the blood and spirits being only considered as their vehicles these two principles say they are seated in all parts of the body in which they perceive life and vigor and that between all parts of the human body there is a certain influence in the one kind and a sympathy on the other and these form the basis of their physic they found their most infallible prognostics on a knowledge of the pulse the theory of which is very extensive an ancient chinese physician has left a complete treatise on this subject written  00 years before the christian era by which it appears that the chinese were acquainted with the circulation of the blood long before any european nation but not to take the merit from our countryman mr harvey this circulation in its full round might not have been discovered before he found it out  when a chinese physician is sent for he places the patients arm upon a pillow applies his four fingers along the artery sometimes touching it gently and sometimes more forcibly and after examining it for a considerable time without asking any questions he will tell the patient where he feels pain what parts are attacked and what are most exposed to danger he will also tell him in what manner and in what time his disorder will terminate  their physic however is almost quackery they have the greatest confidence in their simples with which and a few fruits they compose the greater part of all their cordials ginseng of which i have spoken is considered with them as a plant of the first class and to distinguish it from all others is called the plant it is prepared    different ways which form as many different prescriptions it is a scarce root was formerly sold for its weight in silver and at present costs almost its weight in gold they alllow tea to be a great and powerful medicine but they recommend it to be used moderately never to be drank hotter than warm and by no means on an empty stomach  i will conclude this chapter with the method the chinese tribunals take to discover whether a person has died a natural death or in consequence of some violence and even after the body has began to putrify  the body being first taken from the earth is washed in vinegar after this a large fire is kindled in a pit dug on purpose six feet long three wide and three deep and this fire is continually augmented till the surrounding earth is as hot as an oven the remaining fire is then taken from the pit a large quantity of wine poured into it and it is covered with a hurdle made of osier twigs on which the body is stretched at full length a cloth is thrown over both in the form of an arch in order that the steam of the wine may act upon it in every direction at the end of two hours this cloth is taken off and if any blows has been given they will appear upon the body in whatever state it may be the same experiment is even extended to bones stripped of their flesh the chinese assure us that if the blows given have been so severe as to occasion death this experiment makes the marks appear upon the bones though none of them may be broken or injured  we must here remark that the wine mentioned is a kind of beer made from rice and honey  a necessary observation should any one in europe make an attempt to prove the truth of the expedient which deserves so much to be verified as in certain criminal cases it may tend to clear up doubts and exculpate innocence  finis of other nations subject to the chinese from dampier tavernier etc chap xvi of the kingdom of tonquin besides the tartars in the north and bordering upon the russian territories whom i have already described they have some mountaineers on the back or western provinces of china subjects to the empire these are the sifans the lolos and the miaotse the first inhabit the provinces of chensi and setchuen the second are dispersed throughout the province of yunnan and the latter the mountains throughout the provinces of setchuen koeitcheou houquang quangsi and on the frontiers of the province of quangtong  the sifans live together in small bodies subject to families the oldest of which becomes a lama who has the power of trying causes and punishing criminals the greater part live in tents forming small hamlets of five or six families each they keep large flocks and are in want of none of the necessaries of life they are of a proud and independent spirit and submit to the chinese with reluctance when summoned by the mandarins they rarely appear but government winks at their contempt for political reasons and endeavors to keep them in subjection by mildness and moderation indeed it would be difficult to reduce them as their wild and frightful mountains covered with snow even in july would afford them shelter from which they could not be driven  the lolos were formerly governed by their own sovereigns but submitted to the emperor of china on condition of enjoying for ever the honors of chinese mandarins these have a language of their own their princes are absolute masters of their subjects and can punish with death and have an army of horse and foot  the miaotse are also under the government of princes no less absolute than those of the lolos and have a regular militia maintained by feudatory lords their arms are bows and halfpikes and their horses wonderfully expert and active when officers are chosen among them the candidates are obliged to ride full speed down the steepest declivities and to clear at one leap very wide ditches in which large fires are kindled these horses are much valued in china are very scarce and fetch a very great price  the miaotse are collected into villages and live in great harmony they employ themselves in husbandry weave a coarse muslin cloth and a kind of carpets their dress is a pair of drawers and a jacket which laps over the breast but they go barefooted the headdress of their women is whimsical they place upon their heads horizontally a piece of board about a foot long and six inches broad over which they spread their hair and fix it to the wood with wax the miaotse ladies consider this as elegant not perceiving the restraint to which it subjects the wearer for they cannot lie down without something to support their necks and cannot make their way through their bushy country but by turning their heads every moment when they comb their hair which they do three or four times a year they are obliged to remain some hours before a large fire to melt the wax and make it run off but after they have combed it they dress it again in the same way  the chinese entertain the most sovereign contempt for this nation and they in their turn despise the chinese however at the loss of a great number of men the chinese made a complete conquest of them in       there are also two or three large states tributary to china that i must mention korea tonquin and cochinchina i will speak of each in their turn  korea which the chinese call kaoli is a large peninsula extending between china and japan  00 leagues long from north to south and  00 broad from east to west it is distance from japan is only    leagues this kingdom is governed by a sovereign who though tributary to china exercises absolute authority over his subjects he is master of all their wealth and inherits it after their death and every seventh year all the freemen of the different provinces are obliged to go to court in rotation and keep guard round the monarch for two months so that during this year all korea is in motion and under arms  they differ so little from the chinese in their persons customs and manners that it is not necessary to dwell upon the subject their women indeed are less confined and in matrimony young folks choose for themselves  tonquin and cochinchina formerly composed one of the most extensive provinces in china three hundred years before the christian era they were inhabited by savages but being conquered by china     before christ the emperor sent here  00000 persons from different parts of the empire filled these two kingdoms with chinese families and caused two brazen pillars to be erected on the boundaries between tonquin and the province of quangsi which are standing to this day these columns have the following inscription when these pillars shall be destroyed tonquin shall perish the tonquinese at present consider this inscription as a prophecy and these columns as monuments on which the fate of their kingdom hangs of course take great care to preserve them by sheltering them from the weather  tonquin extends between the   th and   d degrees of n latitude bounded on the north by the chinese provinces of yunnan and quangsi on the east by the province of canton and the sea on the south by the sea and cochinchina and on the west by the country of laos the capital city is cachao tonquin has a king of its own tributary to china and is divided into eight provinces under as many governors the kings guards consist of  000 soldiers and about  0000 more are stationed on the frontiers on all the rivers of the kingdom where it is probable an enemy might invade are kept  00 large galleys and a great number of galiots in which the sailors row standing this country is healthful and pleasant in dry seasons but from april to august the wet season holds and the lands are annually flooded as in all countries between the tropics at this time of the year this is the cause of the niles overflowing in egypt between the beginning of august and the latter end of october happen those violent storms called tuffoons or typhones which are so furious that the chinese dare not stir from their harbors  in the woody mountainous part of this country are found elephants of an extraordinary size five hundred of them are kept for the kings use in war horses they have not many but cows and buffaloes in plenty with the last they plow their land they have neither lions asses nor sheep except some few of the last kept by the king but they have abundance of stags bears tigers and rhinoceroses apes here are remarkable for their size and boldness they will enter a plantation in troops of two or three hundred together eat what they can afterward roll large wisps of straw round their waists fill those wisps with rice and march off in sight of the peasants who dare not attack them their dogs will catch rats and mice and their vigilant ones will watch all night for them like our cats they have great plenty of fowls both wild and tame but very few small birds  among the latter however they have a species of goldfinch which sings so melodiously that they call it the celestial bird its eyes sparkle like the most brilliant ruby it has a round sharp bill an azure ring round its neck and a small tuft of particolored feathers on its head when perched its wings appear variegated with beautiful shades of blue green and yellow but when it flies they lose all their colors in wet weather it conceals itself in the thickest woods but it comes forth when the sun shines as the harbinger of fair weather this bird is said to be an enemy to another singular bird of this country found in marshes and called hokien which it no sooner sees than it appears struck with terror mixed with fury it is neckfeathers stand erect it extends and agitates its wings opens its bill hisses like a serpent and its attitude is that of a bird ready to dart on its prey without offering to attack it contents itself with looking on it is enemy with a fixed and disordered eye as if it felt an inferiority of strength  the wings back and tail of the hokien are of a dazzling white it is head is covered with a reddish down and its belly is a bright yellow speckled with gray and black it is about the size of a quail and breeds only once a year they have also a sort of locusts about as big as a mans finger which breed in ditches and the banks of rivers and are esteemed good food by the natives there are here great swarms of gnats and ants the latter of which are so mischievous that tavernier says they will eat through a bale of silk in    hours and it will look as if it had been sawn asunder  they have gold and silver mines in this country but never open them the soil in general is fertile they grow a great quantity of rice and cultivate it in the same manner as on the coast of coromandel flowing their land with water and when the plants are five or six inches high transplanting them into other grounds their next important object of cultivation is the sugarcane of which they have two kinds and its process of culture is as follows  having turned up the earth to the depth of two feet they plant two or three caneshoots a little inclined and almost in the same manner as vines are planted in italy sinking these slips    inches in the earth and planting them checquerwise at the distance of six feet this is done at the end of the rainy season twelve or fifteen months after it is fit to be cut when the juice is pressed out and boiled for several hours to evaporate part of its water in this state it is carried to market and looks like pure water the merchants who purchase it boil it again with some alkaline substance such as ashes of musa leaves or calcined shells which produce a great froth this is skimmed off and by force of boiling the alkali separates the sugar from the water and the juice is reduced to the consistency of syrup which when it begins to granulate is poured into a large vessel and left to cool this syrup is soon covered with a thin yellow soft crust and is then poured into vessels like funnels after it has stood and acquired the appearance of salt it is bleached and finished in the same manner as in our westindian islands  the tonquinese have but few good fruits and no sweetscented gardenflowers their best fruits are pineapples oranges a kind of red fig and a fig like those of provence in taste and figure that does not grow on the branches of the tree but springs from its root and in such quantities that  0 men may satisfy their hunger with them they cultivate the mulberry and varnishtree cotton tea indigo saffron and pepper but neglect the vine and they have a large tree that bears neither leaves nor fruit they have another curious tree the branches of which bend naturally down strike root and spring up again into other trees whose branches do the same so that one of these trees will in course of time extend itself a great way round in their gardens they have yams potatoes and onions and the betel leaf which is so much valued over all india is very common in this country  having a very large seacoast and many fine rivers well stocked with fish their fisheries employ a great number of hands and many of them live with their whole families upon the water seaturtles are very plentiful on their shores  the bay of tonquin by which europeans approach this kingdom is about  0 leagues wide in the broadest place has about    fathom water and a good anchorage every where european ships pass up the river domea to cachao where the english and dutch east india companies have each of them a factory this city lies about  00 miles up the river and  0 from the places where their ships anchor there is a delightful prospect all the way up the river of a large level fruitful country consisting of pasture and ricegrounds but no trees except about their villages which are surrounded with them  cachao stands on the river domea on a rising ground but without either bank wall or ditch to defend it it consists of about  0000 lowbuilt houses with mudwalls and thatched roofs except the english and dutch factories which are ordinary low brick houses the chief streets are very wide but ill paved and are dirty in wet weather and there are several ponds and ditches full of black mud which in dry seasons are very offensive but yet the town is healthy every family has in their back yard an arched brick building like an oven about six feet high to secure his best goods in case of fire to which thatched buildings are very liable but government by way of prevention obliges every man to keep a great jar of water on the top of his house with buckets and if the fire cannot be extinguished this way the thatch is so contrived in large pieces or frames of seven or eight feet square to be thrown off at once and they keep hooks like our firemen to pull down the buildings that are in flames  there are three palaces in cachao in the chief of which the boua or king resides it is three leagues in circumference and has a wall about    feet high faced on both sides with brick and within the palace besides the buildings and apartments there are parks gardens and canals as in the royal palaces of china in one of the other palaces the general resides before this is a parade where the soldiers are exercised opposite to this is another low building where the artillery is kept which consists of about  0 or  0 iron guns two or three whole culverins and some iron mortars but the carriages are generally out of repair near this palace is a stable for  00 elephants kept for war  there are but few cities in tonquin besides cachao hean is one of the principal which has about  000 houses market towns they have none but every five or six villages take it by turns to have the market held in one of them these stand very thick all over the country in flat spots and consist of  0 or  0 houses always surrounded by groves of trees and encompassed by large moats and banks thrown up beyond the groves to prevent the houses and gardens being overflown in the rainy season for all the land about them lies there two or three feet deep in water and they are forced either to wade through it from one village to another or go in boats  the partitions in their houses are made with split cane and their rooms have no other light than what they receive from a little square hole their furniture consists of tables stools and an ordinary bed or two in their innermost rooms every house has a little altar with an image or two and incense put upon it they dress their meat usually in their yards in fair weather and within doors in wet but the rooms having no chimnies they are at such times almost suffocated with smoke  the tonquinese are neither so flatnosed nor so broadvisaged as the chinese their complexion is olive they are cleanmade stronglimbed and of a middle stature have long black lank hair which grows very thick and hangs down over their shoulders they suffer their nails to grow as do the chinese and when they are about    or    years of age dye their teeth black which operation takes up three or four days during which the composition being so nauseous they scarce take any nourishment they are ingenious and in disposition free and open though cheating among them when done with address is considered as a piece of prudence and skill they are generous but their generosity being regulated only by their interest they never give where there is no expectation of a return of course lest they should be importuned take great care to conceal their wealth and yet are lavish in their public expenses especially in feasts marriages and funerals they hate the europeans and take great pleasure in overreaching them  the different sexes are not distinguishable by their dress the outward habit is a long gown tied round the waist with a sash persons of distinction wear silk but they never think themselves finer than when clothed in red or green english broadcloth and wear caps of the same stuff with their gowns inferior people and soldiers wear cotton cloth dyed of a dark color and a soldiers uppergarment reaches no lower than his knees but they have drawers or trowsers that come down to the middle of the leg the very poor scarce wear any thing but a doublet and a pair of drawers without either shirt shoes or stockings and sit crosslegged on benches raised about a foot high and covered with mats all round the rooms where they make their entertainments after the manner of the asiaticks but they place a cushion for their friends to sit on another at their backs and place a kind of umbrella or alcove over their heads  from a barbarous persuasion that they have a power of disposing of their own lives and those that belong to them the tonquinese says the reverend mr ovington in his voyage to surat poison each year one of the fruits of the araguer and give it to a child to eat conceiving that by the death of an innocent child they shall thrive the better the succeeding year  one part of the year all the people are slaves for except the citizens of the capital all the tradesmen joiners smiths masons carpenters etc are obliged to work three months in the palace and two or three for the mandarins and great lords the rest of the year they act as they please they have also particularities in their food they eat buffaloes dogs cats locusts horseflesh which they esteem equal to beef and the flesh of the elephants that die a natural death the trunk is often made a present of to some great mandarin as a delicacy frogs are another great dish with them bullocks they singe like baconhogs and having steeped slices of raw beef in vinegar for three or four hours will eat it with a particular gust small fish and shrimps they throw into a jar of salted water made very weak which after some little time is reduced to a pulp they use this as we do foy and think it equally good and often eat it with rice but people of quality are seldom without flesh fish and fowl at their tables every day their meat is served up in small plates of lacquered wood and being cut into little square pieces they eat it as do the chinese with chopsticks they also salt their eggs in the manner i have mentioned and putting them in an earthen pot close stopped they will keep for years  their usual liquor is tea sold by women in the marketplaces and they have also arrack but of the worst kind in which they infuse snakes and scorpions and consider it thus as an antidote against poison  father horta gives us some very interesting details respecting the ceremonies the tonquinese use in their visits  entertainments the person who pays the visit stops at the gate and gives the porter a few loose leaves of paper containing about eight or ten pages on which are written in large characters his name and titles together with the intention of his visit these leaves are white covered with red paper but they have them of different colors according to the rank of the person whom they visit if the master is out the paper is left and the visit paid if he is at home the visit is conducted as i have described in china with all their ceremonies and customs not omitting the comedies their cards of invitation run thus the following being one that horta copied  chaoting has prepared a repast of some herbs cleaned his glasses and arranged his house in order that setong may come and entertain him with the charms of his conversation and the eloquence of his learning he therefore begs he will not refuse him that divine pleasure  but the first thing they entertain with is betel and arak they wrap up several slices of the araknut in a betelleaf and daub it over with mortar made of lime and strangers on a visit are offered some of this to chew the person giving it with the right hand from a box which every man like a snuff box carries about him i particularly mentioned the right hand as the left is only used for the worst of offices nor can a man be more unfortunate than to be found left handed among this people or indeed in any part of india the betel and arak which they eat is a kind of opiate which lulls people that use it into a pleasing dream and it gives a red color to the lips it makes the chewer spit but the better sort of people in india have a servant whose sole business it is to carry a pot after them to spit in  having a number of rivers there is good traveling by water and their highways and bridges are kept in good order and though they have no public inns yet a traveller is sure to meet by the wayside with fire water and other conveniences to dress his food and refresh himself the baggage in time of war is carried by elephants and in the upland countries they probably use porters as does the chinese for they have but few beasts of burden  wives are purchased here as in china and the people are not stinted to any number and in time of scarcity they will sell their wives and children for provision dempier assures us that men of the first quality will offer their daughters to the merchants and other officers who come to trade there though they know their stay will be but a few months and this with the hopes of mending the breed and that their posterity may be of a whiter cast then themselves besides the women think this as lawful a way of getting money as any other and some of them will lay up fortunes by it and if they should breed very fast they have the liberty of selling their children the dutch who have frequently been here contract a temporary marriage with the women of this country and tonquinese make them their factors to buy up silk and materials at the dead time of the year and employ the poor when work is cheapest so as to be ready by the arrival of their ships many of the dutch have raised good fortunes by these female factors who are faithful to them and the women have also enriched themselves and been matches afterward for the best lords of the country when their dutch husbands have discontinued trading and left them the seamen also are very intimate with the natives who teach them the art of gardening and live here with their new accustomed wives as if they were at home the law grants a divorce to the man but denies it to the woman and in such case the children remain with the father all the ceremony of divorces is the taking a chopstick of the husbands and another of the wifes and breaking them in half one part of each is given to the man to keep and the other to the woman if a woman is convicted of adultery she is thrown to an elephant who is trained up for these executions the beast having tossed her up in the air tramples her to pieces when she falls to the ground  the favorite diversions of the tonquinese are comedies which they generally act at night and accompany with abundance of machinery and decorations they excel particularly in the representation of torrents rivers seas tempests and navalbattles  there are no common burialplaces in tonquin every one is buried in his own ground and within a month afterward a great feast is made at his grave at which the priest by his office assists over the graves of the opulent a tower of wood is built seven or eight feet square and above five and twenty feet high which the priest ascends and makes a speech from the top then comes down and the building in set on fire which being slightly built with painted boards is soon consumed after which the people proceed to rejoicing and are very merry on the death of a monarch tavernier says the mandarins wear mourning for three years those of the household for nine months the nobility six and the common people three months but there are no public amusements for three years except at the coronation of the succeeding king  this government is one of the strangest we have heard of the rightful prince enjoys little more than the empty title of king the general or prime minister being master of all the treasure and forces of the kingdom and to whom all men pay their court this is a usurped power of the generals which he keeps up having near  00000 men at his command and keeps the real king as it were a prisoner in his own palace soldiers are here taught to make their own gunpowder in little handmills every one has a touch box their guns have matchlocks and no people  and fire quicker they keep their arms very bright and cover them with lacquered cane in bad weather they pick their men by their appetites and the generals guard consists of the best eaters the greatest part of their forces are kept on the frontiers of cochinchina and between the outguards of each kingdom they have frequent skirmishes but these seldom come to a general engagement the army never takes the field or encamps but in the dry season when it marches the guards and principal officers are mounted upon elephants in little wooden apartments they carry no artillery with them but some long guns which they rest on forks to fire and which they use to clear a pass or fire across a river their naval force is but small consisting only of galleys  0 or  0 feet long and very narrow the head and stern raised  0 or    feet above the water but in the middle not more than two the captain sits in the stern which is finely painted and gilded and the soldiers who are always the rowers have an awning over them to keep them dry they push their oars from them and plunge them all into the water at once according to a signal given these vessels do not draw above two feet and a half water and cannot be used at sea but in calm weather they employ their soldiers to prevent smuggling and these also keep watch in the towns at night but are then only armed with long staves yet yet are insolent and troublesome to all that pass them and their officers to whom only they are accountable are not very ready to receive complaints  there are no courts of judicature but any single magistrate can punish agreeable to the laws and without appeal sentence being executed immediately murder and capital offenses are punished by beheading before the offenders own door or where the fact was committed the criminal is set on the ground and his head is taken off at one blow by a backsword theft is punished by mutilation or cutting off the the joint of a finger a whole finger or the whole hand according to the degree of offense adultery as i observed before by throwing the adulteress to an elephant for lesser offenses the wooden collar and bamboo are used as in china and for debt the debtor is condemned to become a prisoner to his creditor and work for him till the debt is paid  most of their magistrates are eunuchs each governor is absolute in his province and when a eunuchmandarin dies his effects are the property of government on which account their extortions are winked at the mandarins though eunuchs will keep young wenches to play with and will often recommend their girls to europeans who trade there and take their acceptance of them kindly  once a year an oath of fidelity is administered to all the subjects in every province and on this occasion every one drinks a cup of some fowls blood mixed with arrack they have no coin but spanish rials of course make their payments in little pieces of silver as do the chinese  this country produces great quantities of silk such as pelongs soosees hawkins peniascoes and gause the two latter are sometimes plain and sometimes flowered the lacquered ware is another great manufacture in this kingdom and next to that of japan esteemed the best in the world the excellence does not so much consist in the paint and varnish as in the wood which is a kind of fir the different coats of varnish are laid on in fine weather one after another as they dry and after the outer coat is dry it is polished by rubbing this country is famous also for lignum aloes tavernier tells us there is so great a difference in the goodness of this wood that it may be had from three crowns to a thousand if it be close and oily a piece the size of a pea thrown into the fire will perfume a room as much as a dry piece as large as a mans fist  the tonquinese make no long voyages nor export any merchandise in their own bottoms except fish and rice to some neighboring countries they deal much fairer than the chinese and perform their contracts punctually only that the merchant is forced to wait several months for the making of his goods they are pretty good mechanics and have almost all kinds of handicrafts among them money changing is here a great profession and managed by the women who are so dextrous at it that they will raise and lower the price of cash as artfully as our stockjobbers do the stocks  learning in tonquin is on a par with that of china the tonquinese apply to letters from emulations as they open the way to honor and they cannot be promoted to offices of dignity but in proportion to their abilities degrees in literature are conferred by the monarch after a public examination in the palace courtyard before the king and all the grandees of the state their language is a kind of guttural chinese  their physicians study little but the nature of simples and the doctrine of the pulse by which like the chinese they pretend to discern the cause and seat of every disorder the purple fever a disorder very dangerous in europe is here thought little of they treat it as follows taking the pith of a certain reed they dip it in oil and apply it to all the purple spots on the body one after another the flesh then bursts with a report as loud as a pistol and after the corrupted blood has been squeezed out they complete the cure by rubbing the wounds with ginger this remedy must be painful but we are assured that its efficacy is certain  persons are often bit here by serpents but the cure is at hand they have a small stone much resembling a chestnut the virtue of which is almost miraculous it is called the serpentstone when any one has been bit by a venomous reptile the blood is pressed out and this healing stone applied to the wound where it adheres and gradually sucks out the poison when impregnated with the poison it drops off like a leech when full it is then carefully washed with milk and water in which lime has been diluted and applied to the wound a second time where it sticks till it has exhaled all the virus in less than an hour the patient finds himself without fever or any kind of pain  bleeding is the physicians last resource but to purify the blood they use the powder of a crab found on the shores here often in a state of petrifaction and which they reduce to powder and administer it internally in water wine or oil  their religion is a mixture of the chinese worship and other superstitions they admit of the doctrine of transmigration believe the world to be eternal imagine the air to be full of spirits but acknowledge one supreme being men of learning follow the doctrine of confucius to whom they often sacrifice they study astrology and consult the pretenders in this art on every occasion the christian religion had made a considerable progress in this kingdom some few years back the jesuitmissionaries had built several churches and made many thousand convents but as the king and court were averse to it it is impossible to say what may be the case now  chap xvii of cochinchina thibet hami and the island of formosa etc cochinchina is a kingdom that extends from the eighth degree of north latitude to the   th is upwards of  00 miles long and about   0 broad it is bounded on the north by tonquin by the chinese sea on the east the indian ocean on the south and the kingdom of camboya on the west it is divided into five provinces the king keeps his court in that of sinuva which lies contiguous unto tonquin  this state is tributary to china whilst the kings of tsiampa and camboya are tributary to cochinchina the islands of pulo and condore which lie in eight degrees  0 min north latitude are also subject to it these islands are but small and only one the largest is inhabited being between four and five leagues long and three broad the inhabitants are chochinchinese and speak the malayan language the english had a settlement here in   0  consisting of    europeans whom the natives massacred in their beds on the second of march that year and set fire to the factory they have wild cocks and hens here about the size of crows  the natives of cochinchina have a common origin with the tonquinese and differ so little in their manner of living laws and customs which they have borrowed in great part from the chinese that it is not necessary to describe them it is from four small islands situated on this coast that those celebrated birdsnests are found so much sought after for seasoning ragouts and which give so exquisite a taste to sauces and where those turtles are found in such prodigious number the flesh of which is so delicate that the tonquinese and people of cochinchina often fight desperate battles in order to take them from one another  thibet the kingdom of thibet though partially visited by some missionaries was never properly explored till mr bogle went there he resided several months at the capital of this kingdom and it is expected will one day favor the public with an account of it the following is chiefly collected from his papers by mr stewart and was sent to our royal society  this country is known ih india by the name of boutan it lies north of hindostan and is all along separated from it by a range of high and steep mountains properly a continuation of the great caucasus which stretches from ancient media and the shores of the caspian sea round the northeast frontiers of persia to candahar and cassemire and thence continuing its course morse easterly forms the great northern barrier to the various provinces of the mogul empire and ends either in assam or china it is reckoned to be   0 leagues in extent from east to west and   0 from north to south and is tributary to china  the bonzes of thibet about the year      assumed the title of grand lamas the most powerful of whom made lahassa the place of his residence and was acknowledged chief of all the lamas and the successors of the grand lama about the beginning of the last century took the title of delai lama at which time an attempt was made to introduce the christian religion by father andrada a jesuitmissionary and the reigning prince seemed inclined to embrace it but the delailama opposed him made a league with the tartars of kokonor marched an army against him defeated him and put him to death  mr bogle divides the territories of the delai lama into two different parts that which lies immediately contiguous to bengal and is called by the inhabitants docpo he distinguishes by the name of boutan and the other which extends to the northward as far as the frontiers of tartary called by the natives pu he styles thibet boutan is ruled by the dah terriah or deb rajah who is a feudatory of thibet it is a country of steep and inaccessible mountains whose summits are crowned with eternal snow they are intersected with deep valleys through which numberless torrents pour that increase in their course and at last gaining the plains lose themselves in the great rivers of bengal these mountains are covered down their sides with forests of stately trees of various kinds pines etc many of which are known in europe and others peculiar to this country and climate the valleys and sides of the hills which admit of cultivation are not unfruitful but produce crops of wheat barley and rice  the inhabitants are a stout and warlike people of a copper complexion in size rather above the middle european stature hasty and quarrelsome in their temper and addicted to the use of spirituous liquors but honest in their dealings robbery by violence being almost unknown to them  the chief city is tassey seddein situated on the patchoo thibet begins properly from the top of the great ridge of the caucasus and extends from thence in breadth to the confines of great tartary and perhaps to some of the dominions of the russian empire mr bogle says that having once attained the summit of the boutan mountains we do not descend in an equal proportion on the side of thibet but continuing still on a very elevated base traverse valleys wider and not so deep as the former and mountains neither so steep nor apparently so high on the other hand he represents it as the most bare and desolate country he ever saw the woods which every where cover the mountains in boutan are here totally unknown except a few straggling trees near the villages nothing of the sort is to be seen the climate is extremely severe and rude at chamnanning where he wintered although in latitude       only eight degrees north of calcutta he often found the thermometer in his room at    under the freezing point by fahrenheits scale and in the middle of april the standing waters were all frozen and heavy showers of snow perpetually fell owing no doubt to the great elevation of the country and to the vast frozen space over which the north wind blows uninterruptedly from the pole through the vast deserts of siberia and tartary till it is stopped by this formidable wall  the thibetians are of smaller size than their southern neighbors and of a less robust make their complexions are also fairer and many of them have even a ruddiness in their countenances unknown in the other climates of the east mr stewart says that he saw at calcutta one who had quite the tartarface they are of a mild and cheerful temper continues mr bogle and the higher ranks are polite and entertaining in conversation in which they never mix either flattery or any strained compliments  the common people both in boutan aad thibet are clothed in coarse woollen stuffs of their own manufacture lined with such skins as they can procure but the better order of men are dressed in european cloth or china silk lined with the finest siberian furs the use of linen is totally unknown among them the lamas of thibet wear a napped kind of woollen stuff the delai lama is clothed in a red dress of this stuff wearing on his head a yellow cap ornamented with gilding besides this cap the lamas wear occasionally a tiara resembling a bishops mitre but the cloven part of this mitre is in front and comes down to the forehead the lamas in china appear in public investments of red and yellow satin trimmed with the richest furs are all mounted on excellent horses and are followed by a number of domestics proportioned to their ranks as mandarins which rank they are allowed  the thibetians speak a language different from the tartars and almost similar to the chinese sifans their chief food is the milk of their cattle prepared into cheese butter or mixed with the flour of a coarse barley or of peace the only grain which their soil produces and even these articles are in scanty proportion but they are furnished with rice and wheat from bengal and other countries in their neighborhood they are also supplied with fish from the rivers in their own and the neighboring provinces salted and sent into the interior parts they have no want of animal food from the cattle sheep and hogs which are raised upon their hills and are not destitute of game they have a singular method of preparing their mutton by exposing the carcass entire after the entrails are taken out to the sun and bleak northern winds which blow in the months of august and september without frost and which so dries up the juices and parches the skin that the meat will keep uncorrupted for the year round this they generally eat raw without any other preparation mr bogle was often regaled with this dish which however unpalatable at first he says he afterward preferred to their dressed mutton just killed which was generally tough lean and rank it was also common for the principal men in the villages through which he passed to make him presents of sheep so prepared set before him on their legs as if they had been alive  polygamy at least in the sense we commonly receive the word is not in practice among them but it exists in a manner more repugnant to european ideas it consists in a plurality of husbands which is firmly established and highly respected there and the degree of kindred between the husbands are no obstacle to the marriage a woman for example may marry all the brothers of one family the children are divided among them the eldest has the firstborn and the younger those that are born afterward notwithstanding such brothers having one wife in common they generally live in great harmony and comfort with her not but sometimes little dissentions will arise as may happen in families constituted on different principles an instance of which mr bogle mentions in the case of a modest and virtuous lady the wife of half a dozen of the tayshoo lamas nephews who complained to the uncle that the two youngest of her husbands did not furnish that quota of love and benevolence to the common stock which duty and religion required of them their excuse for this custom which strange as it is is an unquestionable fact is the scarcity of women in thibet and tartary more girls than boys are seen in their families of course the plea is a pretended one indeed in a country where the means of subsisting a family are not easily found it seems not impolitic to allow a set of brothers to agree in raising one which is to be maintained by their joint efforts  the manner of bestowing their dead is also singular they neither inter them like europeans nor burn them like the hindoos but expose them on the bleak pinnacle of some neighboring mountain to be devoured by wild beasts and bird of prey or wasted away by time and the changes of weather the mangled carcases and bleached bones lie scattered about and amidst this seen of horror some miserable old wretch man or woman lost to all feelings but those of superstition generally sets up an abode to perform the dismal office of receiving the bodies assigning each a place and gathering up the remains when too widely dispersed  the city of lahassa which is the capital of thibet is of no inconsiderable size and is represented as populous and flourishing it is the residence of officers of government and of the chinese mandarins and their suite it is also inhabited by chinese and cassemirian merchants and artificers and is the daily resort of numberless traders from all quarters who come in occasional parties or in stated caravans the waters of the great river as it is called emphatically in their language wash its walls father du halde traces this river with great accuracy it rises in the cassemirian mountains runs through the great valley of thibet till turning suddenly to the southward it flows into the middle of the kingdom of assam thence returns traversing that country westerly enters bengal toward rangamatty and thence bending its course more southerly joins the ganges its sister and rival with an equal if not more copious stream forming at the conflux a body of fresh running water hardly to be equalled in the known world and disemboguing itself into the bay of bengal two such rivers uniting in this happy country with all the beauty fertility and convenience which they bring well entitles it to the name of the paradise of nations always bestowed upon it by the moguls  their cities in general are very small and indeed lahassa itself is rather a celebrated temple than a city as to fortified towns or places of defense they have none the residence of the delai lama is at pateli a vast palace on a mountain near the banks of the barampooler about seven miles from lahassa the tayshoo lama who in authority and sanctity of character is next to the delai lama and who during the minority of the latter acts as chief this tayshoo lama has several palaces and castles in one of which mr bogle lived with him five months every thing within his gates breathed peace order and dignified elegance the castle is of stone or brick with many courts lofty halls terraces and porticoes and the apartments are in general roomy and highly finished in the chinese style with gilding painting and varnish but there are two conveniences to which they are utter strangers namely staircases and windows there is no access to the upper rooms but by a sort of ladders of wood or iron and for windows they have only holes in the cielings with penthouse covers contrived so as to shut up on the weatherside firing is so scarce that little is used but for culinary purposes and they trust altogether for warmth in their houses to their furs and other clothing when mr bogle conversed with the lama he gave him to understand that his knowledge was not merely confined to his own country but he found that the russian empire was the only one in europe known to him that he had a high idea of its riches and strength and had heard of its wars and success against the empire of rome for so they call the turkish state but could not conceive it could be in any wise a match for cathay many of the tartar subjects of russia travel to thibet and the court of petersburgh has at various times sent letters and presents to the lama mr bogle saw many european articles in his possession such as pictures lookingglasses and trinkets of gold silver and steel made in england which he had received as presents from russia and particularly a repeatingwatch by graham which not going they said had been dead for some time  of the religion and political constitution of this country which are intimately blended i can only say that ever since the expulsion of the eluth tartars the kingdom of thibet is considered as dependant on china which they call cathay and that there actually reside two mandarins with a garrison of  000 chinese at lahassa the capital to support the government but their power does not extend far and in fact the lama whose empire is founded on the furest grounds personal affection and religious reverence governs every thing internally with unbounded authority we have seen that the delai lama is the great object of adoration among the various tribes of heathen tartars who roam through the vast tract of continent which stretches from the banks of the wolga to corea on the sea of japan the most extensive religious dominion perhaps on the face of the globe he is not only the sovereign pontiff the vicegerent of the deity on earth but as superstition is ever the strongest where it is furthest removed from its objects the more remote tartars regard him as the deity himself they believe him as i have had occasion to observe before immortal and endowed with all knowledge and virtue every year they come up from different parts to worship and make rich offerings at his shrine even the emperor of china who is a mantchou tartar does not fail in acknowledgments to him in his religious capacity and actually entertains at a great expense in the palace of peking an inferior lama as has been noticed as a nuncio from thibet it is even reported that many of the tartar chiefs receive certain presents consisting of small portions of that from him which is ever regarded in all other persons as the most humiliating proof of human nature and of being subject to its laws and treasure it up with great reverence in gold boxes to be mixed occasionally in their ragouts mr bogle indeed asserts that the lama makes no such presents but that he often distributes little balls of consecrated flour like the pain benit of the roman catholics which the superstition and blind credulity of his tartar votaries may afterward convert into what they please on the mountain where his palace stands are a great number of pagods the most sumptuous of which he inhabits he passes great part of his life on a kind of altar sitting crosslegged and motionless on a large and magnificent cushion and receives the adoration not only of the people of thibet but of a prodigious number of pilgrims who undertake long and difficult journies to worship him on their knees and receive his benediction he salutes no one neither uncovers nor rises to the greatest prince he merely lays his hand on the head of his votary who imagines that by this imposition he receives a remission of his sins  this profound veneration paid him arises from an opinion that all the divinity of the god fo centers in him and that when he appears to die either of old age or infirmity his soul in fact only quits an actual crazy habitation to look for another younger or better and it is discovered again in the body of some child by certain tokens known only to the lamas or priests in which order he always appears  large pagods are frequendy met with in thibet where the most distinguished of the lamas reside and assume different titles of honor the grand lamas are  00 in number and when common lamas arrive to the dignity of one of these whether thibetian tartar or chinese they live in splendour and opulence and are continually surrounded by a crowd of admirers who load them with presents and they become possessed of great estates indeed the lamas form the most powerful body in the state have the priesthood entirely in their own hands and besides fill up many monastic orders which are held in great veneration among them celibacy does not seem to be positively enjoined to the lamas but it is held indispensibly necessary for both men and women who embrace a religious life and this celibacy their living in communities their cloisters their service in the choirs their strings of beads their fasts and their penances give them so much the air of christian monks that it is not surprising an illiterate capuchin should be ready to hail them as brothers and think he can trace the features of st francis in every thing about them it is an old notion that the religion of thibet is a corruption of christianity but from whencesoever it sprung it is pure and simple in its source conveying very exalted notions of the deity with no contemptible system of morality but in its progress it has been greatly altered and corrupted by the inventions of worldly men  a fate we can hardly regret in a system of error since we know that that of truth has been subject to the same  though many of the principal dogmata of lamaism are totally repugnant to the religion of the bramins or of india yet in others it has a great affinity to it they have for example a great veneration for the cow but they transfer it wholly from the common species to that which bears the tails of which i shall speak hereafter they also highly respect the waters of the ganges the source of which they believe to be in heaven and one of the first effects which the treaty between our indiacompany with the lama produced was an application to the governorgeneral for leave to build a place of worship on its banks which was granted and a spot was appropriated for that purpose about two or three miles from calcutta of this water some is always kept in the palace at peking and the emperor carries some with him whenever he travels on the other hand the sumniasses or indian pilgrims often visit thibet as a holy place and the lama always entertains a body of two or three hundred in his pay  the chief trade from lahassa to peking is carried on by caravans that employ full two years in the journey thither and back again which is not surprising when we consider that the distance cannot be less than  000 english miles and yet it is to be observed that an express from lahassa reaches peking in three weeks  a circumstance much to the honor of the chinese police which knows how to establish so speedy and effectual a communication through mountains and deserts for so long a way  the thibetians besides a less traffic with their neighbors in horses hogs rocksalt coarse cloths and other articles enjoy four staple articles which are sufficient in themselves to procure every foreign commodity of which they stand in need all of which are natural productions and deserve to be particularly noticed the first though the least considerable is that of the cowtails so famous all over india persia and the other kingdoms of the east it is produced by a species of cow or bullock different from what i believe is found says mr stewart in any other country it is of a larger size than the common thibet breed has short horns and no hump on its back its skin is covered with whitish hair of a silky appearance but its chief singularity is in its tail which spreads out broad and long with flowing hairs like that of a beautiful mare but much finer and far more glossy these tails sell very high and are used mounted on silver handles for chowras or brushes to chase away the flies and no man of consequence in india ever goes out or sits in form at home without two chowrawbadars or brushers attending him with such instruments in their hands  the next article is the wool from which the shawl the most delicate woollen manufacture in the world so much prized in the east and now so well known in england is made this wool is the produce of a thibet sheep they are of a small breed in figure nothing differing from our sheep except in their tails which are very broad but their fleeces for the fineness length and beauty of the wool exceed all others in the world the shawls made from this wool all come from cassemire and the cassemirians engross this article and have factors established for the purchase of the wool in every part of thibet from whence it is sent to cassemire where it is worked up and becomes a great source of wealth to that country as well as it is originally to thibet  musk is another of their staple articles the deer which produces it is common in the mountains but being exceedingly shy and frequenting only places the most wild and difficult of access hunting it becomes a trade of great trouble and danger the musk is sent down to calcutta in the natural bag not without great risk of its being adulterated but still it is far superior to any thing of the kind sold in europe  their last staple article is gold of which great quantities are exported from thibet it is found in the sands of the great river as well as in most of the small brooks and torrents that pour from the mountains the quantity collected in this manner though considerable with respect to national gain pays the individual but very moderately for the labor bestowed on it there are however mines of this metal in the northern parts which are the reserved property of the lama and rented out to those who work them it is not found in ore but always in a pure metallic state and only requires to be separated from the spar stone or flint to which it adheres mr hastings the governorgeneral of bengal had a lump sent him to calcutta of about the size of a bullocks kidney which was a hard flint covered with solid gold he caused it to be fawn in two and it was found throughout streaked with the purest metal though they have this gold in great plenty in thibet they never coin any of it into money yet it is still used there as a medium of commerce and goods are rated by the purse of golddust as here by pounds  by a letter sent by the lama to mr hastings in march      written in persian and translated by mr stewart this high priest seems not only to be a sensible man but a man of some learning and policy  a mr foster a gentleman in the eastindiacompanys service passed from bengal through thibet and contrived to penetrate between that kingdom and the caspian sea but when we shall be favored with his narrative is at present uncertain  the country of hami is situated northeast of china at the extremity of the desert of cobi  0 leagues only distant from the province of chensi its prince is a vassal of the chinese emperor and pays tribute to the emperor the country though surrounded with deserts is one of the most delightful in the world producing every kind of grain fruit and culinary herbs their melons are more wholesome than european ones and will keep fresh almost all the winter in      some seeds were brought to paris were sown the year following and succeeded well but the most esteemed production of hami is its dried raisins which have been since cultivated in china the latitude of this place is       more northward than many provinces of france and yet the grapes thrive better here than there and have a superior flavor  it never rains in hami and seldom is dew or fog seen there the country is watered only by the snow which falls in winter whose waters are carefully preserved all the summer the chinese dry their grapes or raisins by holding them over the steam of hot urine and sometimes boiling them a few seconds in wine with a little clarified honey in it but the people of hami let them stand to be ripe then gather them and only hang them in the sun they shrivel but lose none of their substance or grow flat good raisins should be almost as crisp as sugar candy  hami has a number of villages but only one city which is surrounded with lofty walls half a league in circumference with two beautiful gates to the east and west which make a fine appearance at a distance the streets are straight and well laid out the houses have only groundfloors and are built with clay but notwithstanding this as the city stands in a beautiful plain watered by a river sheltered by mountains on the north and enjoys a serene sky it is a delightful place of residence approach it which way we will gardens may be seen containing every thing a fertile and cultivated foil can produce in the mildest climates all the surrounding fields are enchanting terminating in dry plains covered with beautiful houses and the large broadtailed sheep the country appears to abound with fine fossils and valuable minerals the chinese have for a long time procured diamonds and a great deal of gold from it and it supplies them with a kind of agate which they prize exceedingly  with respect to inhabitants of this small state they resemble the chinese in almost every thing are brave capable of enduring fatigue very dextrous in all athletic exercises and make excellent soldiers they are fickle however and soon irritated and when in a passion extremely ferocious and sanguinary  the island of formosa called by the chinese taiouan lies as it were at their own door within  0 leagues of the province of fokien and yet they did not discover it till the year    0 it is situated between      and     0 n latitude is about    leagues long and    broad a long chain of mountains runs through it from north to south and divides it into two parts eastern and western the dutch settled in the western part in      and built the fort of zealand which secured to them the chief harbor in the island but they were driven from thence by a chinese pirate in      who took the place and in      submitted to the emperor of china  the capital city taiouan is in the western part and is large well peopled and a place of great trade every necessary of life may be found in it being as extensive as some firstrate cities in china its natural productions are rice sugar tobacco salt fruits of all kind medicinal herbs cotton cloth hemp etc the greater part of the streets are laid out in a straight line and are all covered with an awning for seven or eight months in the year to moderate the excessive heat these streets are  0 or  0 feet wide and many of them a league long full of rich shops on both sides in which are displayed silks china lacquerware etc alll ranged with such order and symmetry as to wear the appearance of so many decorated galleries and was not the pavement so bad and the place so much crowded with passengers it would be a pleasure to walk through them the houses are generally built of clay and bamboo reeds and the roofs thatched with straw but the awning leaves nothing to be seen but the shops there is only one handsome house in the whole city this was built by the dutch when here is a large edifice three stories high and defended by four demibastions the city has no walls or works to defend it its harbor is a good one but is choking up with sand and will be soon rendered useless  that part of the island which the chinese possess has a number of fertile and extensive plains with many rivulets and a pure and wholesome air the eastern side is inhabited by indians wholly most of the indian fruits are found here and tobacco sugar pepper camphire and cinnamon are common horses sheep hogs and goats are scarce but domestic fowls are plentiful and monkies and stags have multiplied so much that they wander about in large flocks for want of horses and mules the inhabitants train up oxen for riding and by exercise they go as well and expeditiously as the best horses being furnished with bridles saddles and cruppers and a chinese looks as big and proud when mounted in this manner as if carried by the finest barbary courser  the only thing wanting to make this island desirable is wholesome water they have not a drop fit to drink to strangers it is a deadly poison there is none but the water of the capital that can be drank besides this city there are two others and some villages inhabited by chinese alone for they do not suffer any indians to live with them but such as are slaves or domestics the indians inhabit villages to the north and south of them and keep them in awe a garrison of  0000 tartars is kept in the capital which are changed every three years or oftener if necessary  the indian habitations are merely earthhuts without any kind of furniture and they live on rice and the game they catch and we are assured they will run with such surprising swiftness as to outstrip the swiftest greyhound this the chinese attribute to their confining their knees and reins by a light bandage till they are    or    years old the women till the land and the men are employed in hunting their favorite arms are lances which they will throw with great dexterity so as to hit a mark at  0 or  0 feet distance but they have bows and arrows and will kill a pheasant flying with as much certainty as a european will with a gun they go almost naked wearing only a piece of cloth round their waists those who excel in running or coursing are distinguished by having their skin punctured and ornamented with flowers trees and animals but all blacken their teeth and wear bracelets and crowns of shells and crystal those in the north cover their bodies with the skins of stags of which they make a dress without sleeves and cover their heads with caps of palmleaves in form of a cylinder and ornamented with several crowns placed one above another on the top of which they fix pheasantfeathers  they are dirty in their manner of eating placing what they dress on a plain board and conveying it to their mouths with their fingers they eat their flesh half raw and sleep on beds of freshgathered leaves  their marriageceremonies approach near to the simple laws of nature parents are seldom consulted if a young indian has fixed his mind on a girl he is about the place where she lives for several days serenading her with a musical instrument if she is satisfied with his figure she comes forth and joins him and the weddingcontract is soon settled after this they give their parents notice and the brides father prepares an entertainment where the bridegroom remains and afterward considers that house as his own becoming the whole support of it and has no further connection with his own friend of course these islanders prefer daughters to sons and these become the supporters of their old age  although these islanders are entirely subject to the chinese they still preserve some remains of their ancient government each village chooses three or four old men of the first reputation whom they appoint rulers and judges of the rest and to whom they enjoin implicit obedience  to civilize these indians and regulate their taxes government has deputed a chinese to live in every village who is to learn the indian language and to act as interpreter to the mandarins but these interpreters having turned out cruel extortioners the natives have rebelled and expelled the greatest part of them  it was in this island that john struys affirms he saw with his own eyes a man who had a tail more than a foot in length covered with red hair and greatly resembling that of an ox this man with a tail said that his deformity if it was one proceeded from the climate and that all those of the southern part of the island were born with tails like his but john struys is the only author who attests the existence of this extraordinary race of men no other writer who has spoken of formosa makes the least mention of them  another singular circumstance in this island but which appears to be no better authenticated is what rechteren asserts and which may be found in his collection of voyages of the dutch east india company vol v page    that women are not permitted to bring forth children before they are    years of age though they are obliged to marry long before his words are  when women are first married they bring no children into the world they must before that is permitted have attained the age of    or    when they are big with child their priestesses pay them a visit and tread on their bellies with their feet if it be necessary and make them miscarry with perhaps greater pain than they would have had in being brought to bed it would be not only a shame but an enormous crime to bring forth a child before the time prescribed i have seen some females who had already discharged the fruit of their womb    or    times and who were big for the   th when it was lawful for them to bring forth a living child  on the   d of may      the waters of the ocean had very nigh deprived china of this island owing to an earthquake as it is apprehended a most furious wind accompanied with heavy rains and a swell of the sea kept the inhabitants on the coast under continual apprehension from three in the morning till five in the afternoon of being swallowed up by the waves or buried in the bowels of the earth this dreadful tempest seemed to blow for some time from the four corners of the compass and continued with equal violence during the time abovementioned the whole city of taiouan was overflown and destroyed and nothing but ruins and heaps of rubbish left of    ships of war in the harbor by these are meant chinese galleys    disappeared two were dashed to pieces and ten were so shattered as to be unfit for service above  00 smaller vessels shared the same fate eighty were swallowed up five others laden were sunk and  0 or    without the harbor sunk also without leaving the least piece of wreck behind them the whole island was covered with water the crops destroyed and the provisions swept away or spoiled part of the mountain which divides the island sunk and disappeared the rest was overturned and the greater part of the inhabitants perished on hearing of this calamity the emperor ordered all the houses that had been thrown down to be rebuilt and those that were damaged to be repaired at his expense and sufficient provisions sent for the people remaining in short it appears that the humanity of the chinese emperor who is truly a father to his people made good every loss he could find had been sustained out of his private treasury  the islands of lieoukieou have been tributary to china since the year      are in number thirtysix and situated between korea formosa and japan though they are little known to geographers they form a powerful and extensive empire whose inhabitants being civilized ought not to be classed with the savage nations dispersed throughout the islands of asia  some account of the northwestern coasts of america from captain cook who visited those places in the summer of      the continent of america being now traced to the northwest from california quite up to latitude  0 north it appears to be separated only from the easternmost coast of asia by a straight of    leagues in breadth called bherings straits captain cook coasted this continent from nootkasound in latitude  0 to nortonsound in latitude    an extent of  00 miles he was not so long on shore at any one time as to be able to give a perfect description of the country and its inhabitants but as his is the best account we can procure the public must rest satisfied until they are furnished with a better it is reported that a gentleman having traveled through asia to the country of the tschouktsches has crossed bheringsstreights landed on the american continent and means to pursue his way by land through all that continent to hudsonsbay should he live to return before the completion of this work our readers may probably have a fuller account of the savage inhabitants of that part of the globe but circumstanced as we are we can only give them the following  face of the country the country in general seems to be mountainous and in the higher latitudes their mountains are covered with snow captain cook discovered two volcanos near the coast one a complete cone with its crater at the very summit in latitude       n and longitude        e this vulcano when he was there continually threw up vast columns of black smoke it was seldom wholly clear of clouds at times both base and summit would be clear when a narrow cloud sometimes two or three one above another would embrace the middle like a girdle which with the column of smoke rising perpendicularly to a great height out of its top and spreading before the wind into a tail of vast length made a very picturesque appearance and in the back ground of the seen some elevated mountains whose tops towered above the clouds to a most stupendous height added not a little to its awful grandeur it may be worth remarking that the wind at the height to which the smoke of this vulcano reached went sometimes in a direction contrary to what it did at sea even when it blew a fresh gale the other volcano is in latitude  0    but emitting only a white smoke and no fire made no very striking appearance  at nootkasound the land rises every where into steep hills agreeing in their general form ending in round or blunted tops with some sharp though not very prominent ridges on their sides and all of them clothed round to their summits with the thickest woods as well as all the flats bordering on the sea the surface of these hills have but little soil on them their interior parts being solid rocks extending to the seashore  the valleys in the neighborhood of prince williamssound which lies in latitude    are filled with pinetrees about  0 feet high and   feet in girth and from the driftwood which consisted only of firs and which lay in quantities on the beach it is supposed that the pines higher up the country are much of the same size and all of the same kind not a canadian pine or cypress is to be seen prince williams sound is calculated to be   0 leagues west of any part of baffins or hudsonsbay and captain cook was of opinion that if there is any passage from one to the other it must be at least part of it to the north of latitude     three degrees and a half west of prince williams sound is the mouth of a very large river that appears to be navigable and extends a great way up into the country this river is now called cooks river and the point of land being the most eastern extremity of all america hitherto known and lying but    leagues from east cape on the continent of asia is called in the charts cape prince of wales and situated in latitude       and longitude from greenwich        e  climate the climate at nootkasound is infinitely milder than on the east coast of america under the same parallel of latitude the mercury in the thermometer in the month of april never fell in the night lower than    and very often in the day it rose to  0 no such thing as frost was perceived in any of the low grounds on the contrary vegetation had made a considerable progress and grass was already above a foot long  produce though both tin and copper were met with in this country there is little reason to believe that either of them belong to the place neither were any ores of metal seen except a coarse red earthy or ochry substance used by the natives in painting themselves which may probably contain a little iron with a white and a black pigment used for the same purpose  besides the rock and stone that constitutes the mountains and shores which sometimes contain pieces of very coarse quartz things were seen among the natives made of a hard black granite though not remarkably compact or fine grained a greyish whetstone the common oilstone of our carpenters in coarser or finer pieces and some black bits little inferior to the honestone the natives use also the transparent leafy glimmer or muscovy glass a brown leafy or martial sort and they were sometimes seen with pieces of rock crystal tolerably transparent the first two were met with in considerable quantities and probably are found on the spot but the latter seemed to be brought from a greater distance and were held as valuable  in nootkasound the trees consist of the canadian pine the white cypress cypressus thyoides or wild pine with two or three other less common pines the first two make up two thirds of the whole they in general grew with great vigor and were all of a large size  of other vegetable productions there is but little variety though many might have sprung up about the rocks were found strawberry rasberry current and gooseberrybushes and all in a thriving state and some few small black alders also a species of sowthistle goosegrass some crowsfoot with a fine crimson flower and two sorts of anthericum one with a larg orange flower and the other with a blue one some few wild roses were likewise met with just budding a great quantity of young leeks with triangular leaves a small sort of grass and some watercresses which grew abundantly on the sides of rills  in latitude  0 were found some current and strawberrybushes a small yellowflowered violet and the leaves of a plant supposed to be the heraclium of linnaeus and which the americans here dress for food in the same manner as the naives of kamtschtka in latitude    in the month of september when captain cook went ashore he found the country where there was no wood covered with heath and other plants which produced hurtleberries currantberries heathberries etc the berries were ripe the hurtleberries too much so and scarce a single plant in flower the underwood consisted of birch willow and alder which grew thick among the trees the last consisted wholly of the sprucefir none of them above six or eight inches in diameter  animals the animals of this country could be collected only from the skins in possession of the natives there are bears wolves foxes deer racoons polecats martins and the sea otters which are found at the islands east of kamtschtka the bears are small but of a shining black color the deer seem to be the fallowdeer of carolina foxes are in great plenty and in as great variety some being quite yellow with a black tip to the tail others of a deep or reddish yellow intermixed with black and a third sort of a whitish gray or ash color intermixed also with black the ermine is likewise found here but small and scarce nor is the hair remarkably fine though quite white except at the tip of the tail the racoons and squirrels are of the common sort but the latter is less than ours and has a deeper rusty color running along the back  captain cook says he was clear as to the existence of all the above animals but that there were two which he could not distinguish with that certainty one seemed to be that of the elk or moosedeer or buffalo the other a species of the wild cat or lynx hogs dogs and goats have not as yet found their way to this place nor do the natives seem to have any knowledge of our houserats such as they saw on board the english ships they called squirrels and the goats they called eineetla which is the name they give to fawns  at prince williams sound they have the white bear the wolverene or quickhatch with very bright colors and a large sort of ermine but one of the most beautiful skins met with and which seems peculiar to this place is that of a small animal about ten inches long of a brown or rusty color on the back with a great number of obscure whitish specks and the sides of a blueish ash color also with a few of these specks something of the mouse or squirrel kind  the seaanimals seen off this coast are whales porpoises and seals the porpoise is the phocena the seaotter is of this class it living mostly in the water captain cook having procured a young one weighing only   lb made a drawing of it it was of a shining or glossy black color but many of the hairs being tipped with white gave it at first sight a greyish cast the face throat and breast were of a yellowish white or very light brown color which in many of the skins extend the whole length of the belly it had six cutting teeth in each jaw two of those of the lower jaw being very minute and placed without at the base of the two middle ones the fur of these animals as i have had occasion to mention before when speaking of the trade at kiachta is certainly softer and finer than that of any other we know of and therefore the discovery of this part of the continent of north america where so valuable an article of commerce may be met with cannot be a matter of indifference i have had one in my hand and think it is as soft as the skin of a mole it was of the same color as a mole but the fur rather longer they are sold by the russians at kiachta to the chinese from   l english to  0l the skin  birds here in general are not only rare as to the diferent species but very scarce as to numbers and the ew there are are very shy being constantly pursued by the natives for their feathers those which frequent the woods are crows and ravens similar to ours a blueish jay or magpye common wrens which are the only singing birds they have the canadian or migrating thrush and a considerable number of brown eagles with white heads and tails they have also a small species of hawk the heron and the alyon or largecrested american kingfisher they have likewise two species of woodpeckers one less than a thrush black above with white spots on the wings a crimson head neck and breast and a yellowish olivecoloured belly the other is a larger and more elegant bird of a dusky brown color on the back richly waved with black except about the head the belly of a reddish cast with round black spots a black spot on the breast and the underside of the wings and tail a plain scarlet though blackish above with a crimson streak running from the angle of the mouth a little down the neck on each side they have also a small bird of the finchkind about the size of a linnet of a dark dusky color whitish below with a black head and neck and a white bill and a sandpiper the size of a small pigeon of a dusky brown color white below except the throat and breast with a broad white band across the wings add to these hummingbirds which frequently flew about the ships whilst at anchor and a very beautiful bird of the hawk kind met with in    n latitude it is something less than a duck and of a black color except the forepart of the head which is white and from above and below each eye rises an elegant yellowishwhite crest revolved backwards like a rams horn the bill and feet red these are frequently seen in large flocks and is a seabird perhaps the alca monochroa of kamtschatka mentioned by steller  the birds that frequent the waters and the shores are not more numerous than the others the quebrantahuessos gulls and shags are seen off the coast the shag is our cormorant or watercrow there are here two or three sorts of wild ducks one black with a white head which flys in flocks and the other white with a red bill also a brownish duck with a black or deepblue head and neck they have also grouse snipes and plover add to these the great lumme or diver found in our northern countries  fish are more plentiful than birds though not so various the principal sorts found in numbers are herrings about seven inches long the anchovy or sardine a white or silvercoloured bream and another of a gold brown color with many narrow longitudinal blue stripes other fish are scarce as a small brown kind of sculpin such as is found on the coast of norway frostfish a large one something like the bull head with a rough skin without scales and a small brownish cod spotted with white there are also considerable quantities of the chimara or little seawolf which is also akin to the elephantfish some few sharks starfish crabs and a large cuttlefish  about the rocks there is abundance of large muscles some a span long containing now and then large pearls but badly shaped and colored and a variety of other small shellfish and as the natives of nootkasound had some thick branches of red coral we may conclude it is found upon the coast  the only animals of the reptilekind found here are harmless brown snakes striped with white about two feet long and a brownish waterlizzard with a tail exactly like an eel  the insecttribe seems to be more numerous for though when captain cook was at nootka the season of their appearing was only beginning he saw four or five different sorts of common butterflies many humblebees some of our common goosberrymoths two or three sorts of flies a few beetles and some musquitoes  people the people of nootkasound are in general of the common stature but not slender in proportion being commonly pretty full and plump though not muscular their visages are round and full and sometimes broad with high prominent cheekbones the face much depressed above seemingly fallen in across between the temples the nose flattening at the base with wide nostrils and a rounded point the forehead rather low the eyes small black rather languishing than sparkling the mouth round with large round thick lips and the teeth tolerably equal and well set but not very white few of them have any beards except old men those who have wear it only on the chin all the rest they pluck out by the root their eyebrows are scanty and narrow but the hair of their heads is very coarse and strong and without a single exception black straight and lank hanging down over the shoulders their necks are short their arms and body have no particular elegance in their form but are rather clumsy and the limbs in all are very small in proportion to the other parts and crooked or ill made with large feet badly shaped and projecting ancles which last seems to arise from their squatting so much on their hams and knees both in their canoes and houses  their complexion is naturally as white as ours but they so incrust their bodies with paint and dirt that there is no distinguishing the color of their skin during their youth some of them have no disagreeable look if compared with the generality of the people but after attaining a certain age they are all ugly alike on the whole a very remarkable sameness seems to characterize the countenances of the whole nation a dull phleghmatic want of expression with very little variation being strongly marked in all of them  the women so much resemble the men that it is not easy to distinguish them especially as they possess not sufficient natural delicacy to render their persons agreeable and not one did captain cook see even among those who were in the prime of life who had the least pretensions to be called handsome  in prince williams sound the men are squaremade and strong chested with very large heads disproportioned to their bodies short thick necks and large broad spreading faces their eyes though not small are not proportioned to their faces and their noses are broad and turned up at the tip their teeth are broad even and white and their hair like those at nootka black thick straight and strong their beards in general thin or wanting and about the lips of those who had them stiff bristly and brown with these people indeed the features vary and though not handsome their countenances commonly indicate a considerable share of vivacity goodnature and frankness yet some have an air of sullenness and reserve some of their women have agreeable faces and many are here distinguishable from the men by a delicacy of features the complexion of the women is fair but that of the men brownish or swarthy  the natives of nortonsound resemble those of prince williams sound differing much as we have shown from the natives of nootka who according to the best calculation captain cook could make by the number of houses in the two towns of nootka and those people whom he saw in this last sound amount to about  000 in the whole  the common dress of the inhabitants of nootka is a flaxen mantle trimmed on the upper edge with a narrow strip of fur and at the lower edge with fringe and tassels it passes under the left arm and is tied over the right shoulder by a string before and one behind near its middle thus both arms are left free and it hangs evenly covering the left side but leaving the right open except from the loose edges falling on it and except when it is tied round the waist with a girdle of coarse matting or woollen which is often done over this mantle which reaches below the knees is worn a small cloak of the same materials fringed at bottom and reaching to the waist this cloak resembles a round dishcover being quite close except in the middle where there is a hole just large enough to admit the head and then resting on the shoulders it covers the arms to the elbows and the body as far as the waist the head is covered with a cap of a truncated cone or like a flowerpot made of fine matting having the top frequently ornamented with a round or pointed knob or bunch of leather tassels and tied under the chin to prevent its being blown off  besides the above dress common to both sexes the men frequently throw over this cloak a bear wolf or seaotters skin with the hair outward and tie it above as an outer cloak wearing it sometimes behind and sometimes inhabitants of nootka sound on the breast before in rainy weather they throw a coarse mat over their shoulders the hair is commonly worn hanging down loose but some when they have no cap tie it in a bunch on the crown of the head this dress were it kept clean would by no means be inelegant but as they rub their bodies over with a red paint of a clayey or coarse ochry substance mixed with oil their garments contract a rancid offensive smell and a greasy nastiness so that they make a very wretched and dirty appearance and what is still worse their heads and clothes swarm with vermin which they pick off with great composure and eat  whilst their bodies are thus always daubed with red paint their faces are often stained with a black or a bright red or a white color by way of ornament this last gives them a ghastly and disgusting look they also strew the brown martial mica on the paint which makes it glitter the ears of many of them are bored in the lobe where they make a pretty large hole and two others higher up on the outer edge in these holes they hang bits of bone or quills fixed on a leather thong small shells bunches of woollen tassels or pieces of thin copper the septum of the nose in many is also perforated through which they draw a piece of small cord and others wear in the same place small thin pieces of iron brass or copper shaped almost like a horshoe the narrow opening of which receives the septum so that the two points may gently pinch it and the ornament thus hangs over the upper lip about their wrists they wear bracelets or bunches of white buglebeads made of a conic shelly substance bunches of strings with tassels or a broad black shining heavy substance of one piece and about their ancles they also wear frequently many solds of leatherthongs or the sinews of animals twisted to a considerable thickness  thus far their common dress but they have others which they use on extraordinary occasions on visits of ceremony or when they go to war for the first they make of the skins of animals trimmed at the edges with broad borders of fur or that woolen stuff they make embroidered with various figures and tied on as the other garments but over them at such times the general headdress is a quantity of withy or halfbeaten bark wrapped about the head stuck with various large eaglefeathers or powdered as it were with small white feathers the face is then painted with its upper and lower parts of different colors in stripes so that the stripes shall appear as bleeding gashes or it shall be smeared with a kind of tallow mixed with paint and formed into a variety of figures resembling carvedwork sometimes again they will divide their hair into small parcels and tie it in intervals of two inches to the end with thread and others will tie it behind as we do and stick bunches of cypress in it thus dressed they will have a truly savage and ridiculous appearance but this is much heightened when they put on what may be called their monstrous decorations these consist of an endless variety of carved wooden masks or vizors applied on the face or upper part of the head or forehead some of these resemble human faces furnished with hair beards and eyebrows others the heads of eagles and other birds and many the heads of wolves deer porpoises and the like in general these representations much exceed the natural size and they are painted and often strewed with pieces of the foliaceous mica which makes them glitter and seems to augment their enormous deformity they even exceed this sometimes and fix on the same part of the head large pieces of carvedwork resembling the prow of a canoe pointed in the same manner and projecting to a considerable length  the only dress among the people of nootka seemingly adapted to war is a thick leather mantle doubled which from its size appears to be the skin of an elk or buffalo tanned this they fasten on in the common way but so as to reach up over the breast quite to the throat falling at the same time almost to the legs it is sometimes ingeniously painted in different compartments like our heralds coats and is sufficiently strong to resist arrows and the points of spears on the same occasion they sometimes wear a kind of leathercloak covered with rows of dried hoofs of deer disposed horizontally appended by leatherthongs covered with quills which when they move make a rattling noise  though these people cannot be viewed without a kind of horror when equipped in such extravagant dresses yet when divested of them and seen in their common habits they have not the least appearance of ferocity but appear on the contrary as i have already observed to be of a quiet phleghmatic and inactive disposition destitute in some measure of that degree of animation and vivacity necessary to render them agreeable  though not reserved they are far from being talkative but their gravity is rather a consequence of their natural disposition than any sense of propriety or mode of education for when in the greatest passion they know not how to express their anger by any warmth of language or significancy of gesture  their orations which are made either when engaged in dispute or to explain their sentiments on any public occasion seem little more than short sentences or rather single words forcibly repeated and constantly in one tone and degree of strength accompanied only with a single gesture at every sentence that of jerking their whole body a little forward by bending the knee their arms hanging listless by their sides  though there is too much reason to infer from their bringing human skulls and bones to sale that they eat their enemies with a degree of brutal cruelty this circumstance rather marks a general agreement of character with that of almost every tribe of uncivilized men in every age and every part of the globe than that they are to be reproached with peculiar inhumanity they seem to be a docile courteous goodnatured people yet quick in resenting what they consider as an injury but like most other passionate people soon forgeting it  the chief employment of the men seems to be that of fishing and killing land and seaanimals for the maintenance of their families whereas the women are generally employed in manufacturing their flaxen or undergarments in preparing sardines for drying which they carry up from the beach in large baskets after the men have brought them in their canoes the women are also sent in small canoes to collect muscles and other shellfish and perhaps on some other occasions for they manage these with as much dexterity as the men who when in the canoes with them seem to pay little attention to their sex by offering to relieve them from the labor of the paddle nor indeed do they treat them with any particular respect or tenderness in other situations the young men appear to be the most indolent or idle of the whole community for they were either sitting about in scattered companies to bask in the sun or lay wallowing in the sand on the beach like a number of hogs without any covering but this disregard to decency was confined to the men the women were always properly clothed and behaved with the utmost propriety justly diserving all commendation for a bashfulness and modesty becoming their sex and the more meritorious as the men seemed to have no sense of shame  their houses are disposed in three ranges or rows rising gradually behind each other the largest in front the others less besides a few straggling ones at each end these ranges are interrupted or disjoined at irregular distances by narrow paths or lanes that pass upward but those which run in a line with the houses between the rows are much broader though there is some appearance of regularity in their disposition there is none in the houses themselves for each building divided by a path let it be ever so long may be considered as one house or many though there are no complete separations either without or within to distinguish them they are built of very long and broad planks resting upon the edges of each other fastened or tied here and there by withs of pinebark and having only slender posts or rather poles at considerable distances on the outside to which they are also tied but within are some larger poles placed aslant the height of the sides and ends of these habitations is seven or eight feet but the backpart is a little higher by which means the planks that compose the roof slant forwards and are laid on loose so as to be moved about either to put close in order to exclude the rain or in fair weather to be separated to let in the light or pass out the smoke they are however upon the whole miserable dwellings and constructed with little care or ingenuity for though the sideplanks are made to fit pretty closely together in some places in others they are quite open and they have no regular doors the entrance being either by a hole where the unequal length of the planks has accidentally left an opening or where in some cases the planks are made to lap over each other and thus being shortened leave a kind of doorway some holes are also left in the sides by way of windows but without any regularity and these have bits of mat hung before them to keep the rain out the habitations further north on this coast where bhering landed in      are very like those of nootka  within we may frequently see from one end to the other of these ranges of buildings without intermission for though in general there are apartments on each side for the accommodation of families they are such as do not intercept the sight and often consist of no more than pieces of plank running from the sides toward the middle of the house so that if they were complete the whole might be compared to a long stable with a double range of stalls and a broad passage in the middle close to the sides in each of these parts is a little bench of boards raised five or six inches higher than the rest of the floor covered with matts and on which the family sit and sleep these benches are commonly seven or eight feet long and four or five broad in the middle of the floor between them is the fireplace which has neither hearth nor chimney in one house which captain cook saw and which was at the end of a middle range almost separated from the rest by a high close partition their were four of these benches each of which held a single family at a corner and the middle of the room appeared common to them all  their furniture consists chiefly of a great number of chests and boxes of all sizes which are generally piled upon each other close to the door or ends of the room or house and contain their spare garments skins masks and other things which they set a value on some of these are double or one covers the other as a lid others have a lid fastened with thongs and some of the larger ones have a square hole in the upper part by which the things are put in and taken out they are often painted black studded with the teeth of different animals or carved with a kind of friezework and figures of birds or animals by way of ornament their other domestic utensils are mostly square and oblong pails or buckets to hold water and other things with wooden cups and bowls and small shallow wooden troughs about two feet long out of which they eat their food and twigbaskets bags of matting etc their fishingimplements and other things lie or hang up in different parts of the house but without the least order so that the whole is a complete scene of confusion  the nastiness and stench of their houses is equal to their complexion for they dry their fish within doors they also gut them there which with their bones and fragments thrown down at meals and the addition of of other filth lie about in heaps and and are not cleared away till such heaps become almost insupportable in a word their houses are as filthy as hogstyes every thing in and about them stinking of fish trainoil and smoke  filthy however as they are many of them are decorated with images these are nothing more than the trunks of very large trees four or five feet high set up singly or by pairs at the upper end of the apartment with the front carved into a human face the arms and hands cut out on the sides and variously painted so that the whole is truly a monstrous figure a net by way of curtain for the most part hangs before them and it seems at times that they make offerings to them  though their food may be said to consist of every thing they can procure either animal or vegetable the quantity of the latter bears a very small proportion to the former their greatest dependence is on what the sea produces them their chief food is herrings and sardines which being dried and smoked are sewed up in matts so as to form bales three or four feet square they make also a kind of caviare of herrings roe which is their winterbread  large muscles they roast in the shells they are then stuck on long skewers taken off occasionly and eaten dipping them in oil as a sauce of seaanimals their most common food is the porpoise the flesh of which they dry in pieces as they do the herrings they also make a kind of broth of it by putting it fresh with water into a boiler and throwing heated stones into it till sufficiently seethed they put in the flesh and take out the stones with a cleft stick which serves them for tongs the oil these animals produce is stored away and often eat with a spoon of vegetables they eat the leaves of the gooseberry and current and also of the lily without any preparation and some few bulbous roots  their manner of eating is exactly consonant to the nastiness of their houses and persons for the troughs and platters in which they put their food appear never to have been washed from the time they are first made and the dirty remains of a former meal are only swept away by the succeeding one they tear every thing solid or tough to pieces with their teeth for though they make use of knives to cut up their animals they never use them at their meals and the roots which they dig they will eat without even shaking off the earth that adheres to them  weapons their weapons are bows and arrows slings spears short truncheons of stone and a small pickaxe not unlike the common american tomahawk their spears have a long point of bone but some of their arrows are pointed with iron the tomahawk is a stone six or eight inches long pointed at one end and the other fixed into a wooden handle which resembles the human head and neck the stone fixed in the mouth and representing a large tongue and to make the resemblance stronger human hair is fixed to the head this weapon they call taaweesh or tsuskeeah  their number of stoneweapons and the great quantity of human skulls captain cook saw lead him to suppose that they have frequent wars among them and that those wars are bloody  music with respect to their manners and customs we are able to say little of they seem to be fond of singing and to make it a part of their ceremonies when they approached our ship says captain cook they all stood up in their canoes and began to sing some of their songs in which the whole body joined were in a slow and others in quicker time and they accompanied their notes with the most regular motions of their hands or beating in concert with their paddles on the sides of their canoes and making other very expressive gestures at the end of each song they remained silent a few seconds and then began again sometimes pronouncing the word hooee forcibly as a chorus  they keep the exactest concert in their songs which are often sung by great numbers together as those already mentioned these are solemn and slow but their music is not of that confined sort found amongst many rude nations for the variations are very numerous and expressive and the cadence or melody powerfully soothing besides their full concerts sonnets of the same grave cast were frequently sung by single performers who kept time by striking the hand against the thigh the music however was sometimes varied from its predominant solemnity of air and there were instances of stanzas being sung in a more gay and lively strain and even with a degree of humor  the only instruments of music seen if such they may be called were a rattle and a small whistle about n inch long incapable of any variation from having but one hole they use the rattle when they sing and the whistle when they dress themselves like particular animals and endeavor to imitate their howl or cry the whistles are made in the shape of a bird with a few pebbles in the belly and the tail is the handle they look more like a childs rattle  canoes their canoes are of simple structure but apparently well calculated for every useful purpose from the largest which carry  0 persons or more are framed of one tree many of them are forty feet long seven broad and about three deep from the middle toward each end they become gradually narrower the afterpart and stern ending abruptly or perpendicularly with a small knob on the top but the forepart is lengthened out stretching forward and upward ending in a notched point or prow considerably higher than the sides of the canoe which run nearly in a straight line they are chiefly without ornaments though some have little carved work and are studded on the sides with seals teeth as are their masks and weapons a few have also a kind of additional prow like a large cutwater which is painted with the figure of some animal they have no seats or other supporters in the inside than several round sticks little thicker than a cane placed across at middepth they are very light and their breadth and flatness enables them to float firmly without any outrigger which none of them have and which is a remarkable distinction between the navigation of all the american nations and that of the southern parts of the east indies and the islands of the pacific ocean their paddles are light and small shaped in some measure like a large leaf pointed at the bottom broadest in the middle and gradually losing itself in the shaft the whole being about five feet long they have acquired great dexterity by constant use in managing these paddles for sails are no part of their art in navigation  the canoes of the nations in latitude    n longitude     are not made with wood as at nootka except the frame which consists of slender laths this is covered with the skins of seals or such like animals  the canoes of prince williams sound are exactly the same with those of greenland and the esquimaux indians and their weapons and instruments of fishing and hunting are also the same of course they need no description  implements their implements for fishing and hunting at nootka which are both ingeniously contrived and well made are nets hooks and lines harpoons gigs and an instrument like an oar this last is twenty feet long four or five inches broad and about an inch thick each edge for about two thirds of its length the other third being its handle is set with sharp boneteeth about two inches long herrings and sardines and such other small fish as come in shoals are attacked with this instrument which is pushed into the shoal and the fish are caught either upon or between the teeth their hooks are made of bone and wood and rather clumsily but the harpoon with which they strike the whale and lesser seaanimals shows a great deal of contrivance it is composed of a piece of bone on which is fixed the oval blade of a large muscleshell in which is the point of the instrument to this is fastened about two or three fathoms of rope and to throw this harpoon they use a shaft of about    or    feet long to which the line or rope is made fast and to the end of which the harpoon is fixed so as to separate from the shaft and leave it floating on the water as a buoy when the animal darts away with the harpoon  their fishing wears are composed of pieces of wickerwork made of small rods some closer than others according to the size of the fish intended to be caught in them these pieces of wickerwork some of whose superficies are at least  0 feet by    are fixed up edgeways in shallow water by strong poles or pickets that stand firm in the ground how they were used captain cook cannot say as he saw no one attending them but it is apprehended they may be erected for the purpose of enclosing fish in the manner i have represented that the cossacks use them in siberia  every thing of the ropekind is made from thongs of skins and sinews of animals or from the same flaxen substance of which their mantles are manufactured  their great dexterity in woodwork may in some measure be attributed to the assistance they receive from iron tools such as chissels and knives a stone serves them for a mallet and a piece of fishskin for a polisher their knives are of various sizes some very large and their blades are crooked resembling our pruning knife but the cutting edge in the back or unequal part they sharpen their tools on a coarse slate whetstone and keep them constantly bright  manufactures etc their manufactures and mechanic arts are far more extensive and ingenious whether we regard the design or the execution then could have been expected from the natural disposition of the people and the little progress that cultivation has made among them the flaxen and woollen garments with which they cover themselves are their first care and the chief object of their attention the former of these are made of pine tree bark beaten into hemp it is not spun but after being properly prepared is spread upon a stick which is fastened across to two others that stand upright it is disposed in such a manner that the manufacturer who sits on her hams at this simple machine knits it across with small plaited threads at the distance of half an inch from each other though by this method it is not so close or firm as cloth that is woven the bunches between the knots fill up the interstices and form it into a complete cloth and it has the advantage of being softer and more pliable their woollen garments are very like woven cloth and the various figures which are artificially inserted in them destroy the supposition of their being wrought in a loom probably they are made as we have shown that the tartars make their felts they are of different degrees of fineness some resembling our coarse rugs or blankets and others almost equal to our finest sorts even softer and certainly warmer the wool or fur seems to be that of the fox and brown lynx and the ornamental parts or figures in these garments which are disposed with great taste are commonly of different colors being dyed chiefly of a deep brown or of a yellow the last of which when new equals in brightness that in the best of our carpets  to their taste or design in working figures on their garments corresponds their fondness for carving on every thing they make of wood nothing is without a kind of friezework or the figure of some animal upon it but the most general representation is that of the human face which is often cut out upon birds and on their stone and boneweapons the general design of all these things is sufficient to convey a knowledge of the object they are intended to represent but the carving is not executed with that nicety that an ingenious artist would bestow even on an indifferent design indeed in many of their masks and vizors they show themselves able sculptors not only preserving with great exactness the general character of their own faces but finishing the more minute parts with a degree of accuracy in proportion and neatness in execution the strong propensity of these people to works of this sort is remarkable in a great variety of particulars small whole human figures representations of birds fish land and sea animals models of their housholdutensils and of their canoes are found amongst them in great abundance  the imitative arts being nearly allied it is no wonder they should be as good designers as carvers the whole process of their whalefishery is often seen painted on the caps they wear this though rudely executed serves at least to show that though there is no appearance amongst them of a knowledge of letters they have some notions of commemorating and representing actions independent of their songs and traditions  their manner of smokedrying fish is as follows they first hang them within their huts on small rods about a foot from the fire afterward they remove them higher and higher to make room for others till the rods on which the first hang reach the top of the house when completely dried they are taken down packed close in bales and covered with matts till they are wanted cod and other large fish are also cured in the same manner though they sometimes dry them in the open air without fire  in trafficking they betray a knavish disposition and would carry off the goods they wanted without making any return and yet were unwilling to let any grass be cut without it was first paid for the inhabitants of nootka are thieves in the strictest sense of the word for they would pilfer nothing but what they thought would be useful to themselves and captain cook had reason to apprehend that stealing is much practiced among them and chiefly gave rise to their quarrels  the beads iron and copper found amongst these people leave it beyond a doubt that they must have procured them through an interview with the more inland tribes from hudsons bay or the settlements on the canadian lakes unless it can be supposed that the russian indians from kamtschatka which is less likely have extended their habitations further than the nations of the eastern islands communicating along the coast with those of prince williams sound  of the political and religious institutions we can say but little captain cook could only observe that there are such men as chiefs amongst them called acweek and to whom the others are in some measure subordinate but it appeared that the authority of these chiefs extended no farther than to the family to which each chief belongs and who own him for their head as these acweeks are not all elderly men it is concluded that the title comes to them by inheritance of their religion nothing of any moment could be collected  language their language is by no means harsh or disagreeable further than what proceeds from their using the k and h with more force or pronouncing them with less softness than we do and on the whole it abounds rather with what we may call labral and dental than with guttural sounds so that it may be compared to a very coarse or harsh method of lisping it is difficult to represent this sound by any combination of our own letters unless by iszthl this is one of their usual terminations though it sometimes begins a word the next most general termination is tl and many words end with z and ss as for example opulszthl the sun onulszthl the moon rahsheetl dead teeshcheetl to throw a stone koomitz a human skull quakmiss fishroe   they seem to take so great a latitude in their mode of speaking that they have sometimes four or five different terminations of the same word their language in general seems to show the nearest affinity to the american opulszthl the nootka name of the sun not being very unlike vitziputzli the name of the mexican divinity  the following comparison with other neighboring countries will serve to show their affinity with those countries  oonalashka norton sound greenland erquimaux one taradak adowjak attousek attouset two alac

call them wakassians from the word wakash which is frequently in their mouths it seems to express applause approbation or friendship for when they appeared to be satisfied or well pleased with any thing they saw or any accident that happened they would with one voice call out wakash wakash in short so essentially do they differ in their persons their customs and language from the inhabitants of the islands in the pacific ocean that we cannot suppose their respective progenitors to have been united in the same tribe or to have had any intimate connection when they emigrated from their original settlements into the place where we now find their descendants  the common dress of the natives of prince williams sound for men women and children is a kind of close frock reaching generally to the ancles though sometimes only to the knees at the upper part is a hole just sufficient to admit the head with sleeves to the wrist their frocks are made of the skins of different animals the hairy side outward some have their frocks made of the skins of fowls with the down only remaining on them the seams of these garments are ornamented with tassels or a fringe of narrow thongs and a few have a kind of cape or collar and some a hood when it rains they put over this another frock ingeniously made from the intestines of whales so thin and well prepared as to resemble our goldbeaters skin this is made to draw tight round the neck and at the wrists and its skirts when they are in their canoes are so drawn over the brim of the hole in which they sit that no water can enter  they generally go nakedlegged but some few have a kind of skin stockings reaching half way up the thigh and scarce any appear without mittens for the hands made of the skins of bearspaws those who wear any thing on the head resemble those at nootka having high truncated conic caps of straw and sometimes of wood resembling a seals head well painted  the men commonly wear the hair cropped round the neck and forehead but the women allow it to grow long and most of them tie a small lock of it on the crown and a few club it behind after our manner both sexes have their ears perforated with several holes about the outer and lower part of the edge in which they hang little bunches of beads the septum of their noses they also bore and thrust through it the quillfeathers of small birds or little bending ornaments made of a shelly substance strung on a stiff string or cord three or four inches long which gives them a truly picturesque appearance but the most uncommon and unsightly fashion adopted by both sexes is that of slitting or cutting the underlip quite through in the direction of the mouth a little below the swelling part this in ion which is made even in sucking children is often above two inches long and either by its natural retraction when the wound i fresh or by the repetition of some contrivance assumes the true shape of lips and seems so large as to admit the tongue through so that they seem to have two mouths in this artificial mouth they stick a flat narrow ornament of solid shell or bone cut into little narrow pieces like small teeth almost down to the base or thickest part which has a small projecting bit at each end to support it when put into the divided lip the cut part then appearing wards others have the lower lip only performed into separate holes and then the ornament consist of as many distinct studs when the points are pushed through these holes and their heads appear within the lip a another row of teeth immediately under their own  these are their native ornaments but captain cook found many bd among them of european manufacture chiefly of a pale blue color which they hang in their ears about their caps or join to their lipornaments which have a small hole drilled in each point to which they are fastened and others to them till they hang sometimes as low as the point of the chin but in this last case they cannot remove them so easily but as to their own lipornaments they can take them out with their tongue or suck them into the mouth at pleasure they also wear bracelets of shelly beads or of a substance like amber  the men frequently paint their faces of a bright red and of a black color and sometimes of a blue or leadcolour but not in any regular figure and the women in some measure endeavor to imitate them by puncturing or staining the chin with black that comes to a point on each cheek a practice says crantz very similar to one in fashion among the females in greenland they do not paint their bodies says cook but i no where ever saw savages who took more pains to ornament or rather to disfigure their persons  for defensive armor they have a kind of jacket or coat of mail made of thin laths bound together with sinews which makes it quite flexible though so close as not to admit an arrow or dart it only covers the trunk of the body and may not be improperly compared to a womans stays  of their domestic utensils they have round shallow wooden dishes and others of a cylindrical shape much deeper the sides being made of one piece bent round like our chipboxes though thick neatly fastened with thongs and the bottoms fixed in with small wooden pegs others they have smaller and of a more elegant shape somewhat resembling a large butterboat without a handle but more shallow made from a piece of wood or heavy stubstance neatly carved and they have many little square bags much of the same sort with their outerfrocks neatly ornamented with very minute red feathers interwoven with it also many chequered baskets wrought so close as to hold water some woodenmodels of their canoes many little images four or five inches long cut in wood or stuffed clothed in fur and ornamented as they do themselves a kind of dolls and as a substitute for the rattlingbird of nootka they have two or three hoops or concentric pieces of wood with a crossbar fixed in the middle to hold them by to these are fixed a great number of dried barnacleshells with threads which serve as a rattle and make a loud noise when they shake them  captain cook could not speak with any decision of their tools but he saw a kind of stone adze many iron knives some straight others crooked and some very small ones fixed in pretty long handles with the blades bent upwards like some of our shoemakers instruments they have still knives of another sort near two foot long shaped like a dagger with a ridge in the middle these they wear in sheaths of skins hung by a thong round the neck under their frock and used only as weapons every thing they have however is as ingeniously made as if they were furnished with a complete toolchest and their sewing plaiting of sinews and small work on their little bags may be put in competition with the most delicate manufactures found in any part of the known world in short considering the otherwise uncivilized or rude state in which these people are their northern situation amidst a country perpetually covered with snow and the wretched materials they have to work with it appears that their invention and dexterity in all manual works is at least equal to that of any other nation  the food they were seen to eat was driedfish and the flesh of some animal either broiled or roasted they eat also the larger sort of fernroot mentioned at nootka their drink is water and they swallow lumps of snow by mouthfuls they are decent and cleanly in their food and though they sometimes eat the raw fat of some seaanimal they cut it carefully into small pieces with their knives they are also cleanly in their persons and in all their utensils  their language from the various signification their words bear is at first difficult to be understood and seems to have no affinity with that spoken at nootka except the word akashou which implies what is the name of that and is the same at both places  namuk an ornament for the ear lukluk a brown shaggyskin aa yes keeta give me

natives is much the same as at prince williamssound only that here they wear wide boots and deerskin frocks with large hoods in which the women carry their children as do the eskimauxs and greenlanders the women which captain cook saw are short and squat with plump round faces punctured from the lip to the chin their complexion a light coppercolour black and short hair the men with little beards and both sexes have black teeth seemingly filed down level with the gums  the dwellings of these people were seated close to the beach and consisted simply of a sloping roof without any sidewalls composed of logs and covered with grass and earth the floor laid with logs the entrance snug corner cove at one end the fireplace just within and a small hole near the door to let out the smoke  the view given is snugcornercove in nootkasound where captain cook anchored  francis maurelle a spaniard who traced the american coast northward from the coast of california in      tells us that in latitude      which is about nine degrees more to the southward than nootkasound where captain cook anchored the men wear no covering except the cold is intense when they throw over their shoulders the skins of animals binding their heads with garlands of sweet smelling herbs they likewise wear their hair either dishevelled over their shoulders or as the spaniards say en castanna that is so as to resemble a chesnuttree in the slaps of their ears they have rings like those the spaniards have at the end of their muskets they paint their faces and the greater part of their bodies with a black or blue color and puncture their arms in circles as the common people in spain often paint ships and anchors they bind their loins and legs quite down to the ancles very closely with strips of hide or thread  the women cover the tops of their heads with an ornament like the crest of a helmet and wear their hair in two tresses in which they stick many sweet smelling herbs they also use the same rings in their caps which are of bone as the men do in their ears and cover their bodies with the same skins besides which they wear an apron of the same kind about a foot wide with some thread formed into a fringe they likewise bind their legs in the same manner as the men  the underlip of the women is swelled out into three fascias or risings two of which issue from the corners of the mouth to the lowest part of what would be the beard in men and the third from the highest point and middle of that point to the lower like the others this description is rather unintelligible but we are not mistaken in the translation leaving between each a space of clear flesh which is much larger in young women than in old whose faces are generally punctured or tattooed so as to be totally disfigured a mask of such a face may be seen in the leverian museum london  on their necks they wear various fruits or seeds instead of beads some other ornaments also consist of the bones of animals or shells from the seacoast  their houses are square and built with large beams the roof being no higher than the surface of the ground for doors to which they make use of a circular hole just large enough to pass through similar we apprehend to kamtschatka dwellings  the floors of these huts are perfectly smooth and clean with a square hole two feet deep in the center in which they make their fire and round which they are continually warming themselves in cold weather such habitations also secure them when not employed out of doors from the wind and noxious animals this similarity of hut or house to those of the natives in higher latitudes and further west is another argument of the northwestern coast of america being originally peopled from the eastern coast of asia  this tribe of indians is governed by a ruler who directs where they shall hunt and fish for what the community stands in need of and it seems that the authority of this ruler is confined to a particular village of these habitations together with such a district of country as may be supposed to belong to the inhabitants of such a community who sometimes are at war with the villages  they are very early taught the use of a bow for says this author we observed an infant who could scarcely be a year old shooting arrows from a bow proportioned to size and strength and who hit the hand at two or three yards distance if held up for a mark  we never observed that these indians had any idols or made sacrifices but as we found out that they had a plurality of wives or women at least we inferred with good reason that they were perfect atheists  on the death of one of these indians they raised a sort of funeral cry and afterward interred the body within the house of their ruler but from this we could not pronounce that they were idolaters because the cry of lamentation might proceed from affliction and the body might have been burnt that the corpse might not be exposed to wild beasts or to avoid the stench arising from putrefaction  we could not understand their language but they pronounced the spanish with great ease  their arms are chiefly arrows pointed with flint and some of them with iron or copper which we understood were procured from the north probably bartered at the english forts in hudsons bay or with the traveling hords of indians who resort there at stated times such arms are to be seen at the leverian museum london brought from king georges sound on the n w coast of america latitude  0 by captain cook at this museum is also a bow from some place resembling one from the labrador coast these arrows are carried in quivers of wood or bone and hang from their wrist or neck  what they most value is iron and particularly knives or hoops of old barrels they are accustomed to tobacco which they smoked in small wooden pipes in form of a trumpet and procured from little gardens where they had planted it  they chiefly hunt deer cibulos seawolves and otters the only birds met with on this part of the coast were daws hawks very small paroquets ducks and gulls there were also some parrots with red feet bills and heads like lories both in their heads and flight  the fish on this coast are chiefly sardines and cod and what this voyager calls pejerey of which they bring home only as much as will satisfy the wants of the day  we could not learn continues maurelle whether these people had ever been visited by any other ships than ours indeed we had every reason to think they had not but what we saw of the country leaves no doubt of its fertility and that it is capable of producing all the plants of europe in most of the gullies of the hills were rills of clear and cool water the banks of which were covered with herbs as in the meadows of europe of both agreeable verdure and fragrancy among these are castillian roses smallage lilies plantain thistles cammomile and many others we also found strawberries rasberries blackberries sweet onions and potatoes all which grew in great abundance and particularly nearest the rills  the hills were covered with very large high and strait pines some of which we noticed were   0 feet high and four in diameter toward the bottom pines proper for masts and shipbuilding the tides here are as regular as in europe  maurelle traced the coast northward as far as latitude       found the appearance of the country similar to that of latitude    and the natives dressed as their more southern neighbors only that their garments were longer and they wore a cap on their hair which covered their whole head the weather here in july was exceedingly cold with much rain and frost but in latitude    the air was much warmer owing to some large volcanos burning in that neighborhood and which captain cook also mentions and which we have described in the plate of the natives of nootka sound  thus has the northwestern coast of america been traced from california to bheringsstreights by maurelle and cook and no inlet discovered to raise hopes of a northwest passage by hudsonsbay unless it be above the latitude    where the seas are obstructed by large bodies of floating ice in summertime but if a navigator could get into this latitude before june it is generally thought that the ocean between the latitudes  0 and  0 is quite open and that in all likelihood land and inhabitants might be found within  0 degrees of the pole but though our government has long held out a reward of  000l to the first person that shall sail within a degree of the pole and l 0000 to the first discoverer of a northwest passage by hudsonsbay or north of it yet as it is the greenland fishing vessels only that sail so far north and these vessels lose their insurance if they presume to go further than a certain latitude the interest of their owners militates against the encouragement held out by parliament and till these two interests can be reconciled there is little hopes of such a discovery  a description of sweden from busching motraye coxe marshal wraxhall conset and others chap i sweden part of the ancient scandinavia famous for being the native country of the fierce and warlike goths whose emigrations make such a figure in history is bounded by norwegian lapland on the north by the dominions of russia on the east by the baltic sea on the south and by denmark and norway on the west it is about   0 swedish miles in length one swedish mile is equal to six english ones and   0 broad that is extending from the   th to the   th degree of north latitude and from the  0th to the  0th degree of longitude reckoning from the meridian of london but within these bounds is included the province of finland which the russians are now contending for it was originally divided into seven provinces   sweden proper   gothland   livonia   ingria   finland   swedish lapland and   the islands but is now reduced to five livonia and ingria being taken from them by the russians  vast tracts of this country are taken up by deserts and lakes so that the habitable part is confined to narrow bounds the face of the country is pretty similar to that of its neighbors only that it has the advantage of navigable rivers the largest of which are   the motalastrom which issues from the wetter lake and being increased by seventeen rivers forms a waterfall of sixteen feet near nordkioping emptying itself into the baltic   the stang which divides eastgothland into two parts   the gothic river which rises in the wener lake falls into the north sea near gottenburg forming a steep cataract in its way   the gullspang dividing west gothland from wenerland and   the dalelbe in the valecountry which is the largest in all sweden  the waterfall of trolhatta is a stupendous cataract in the gothic river almost seven and a half swedish miles from its mouth and the water is here precipitated between two rocks and consists of three cascades each of which is above five fathoms high but  00 fathoms from each other half a mile from one of these falls is a bridge built from one rock to another over another high cataract formed by this water at the bottom of which great numbers of fine salmon are caught these two cataracts make a fine appearance  in one place says conset it falls over a rock  0 feet high with such a noise that it is heard at the distance of  00 furlongs the timber that is floated down this river to gottenburg falls over this precipice with such impetuosity that it disappears for a considerable time before it rises again and the bed of the river into which this cataract falls has been sounded by lines of several hundred fathoms but could never be reached  the cataract of the river dahl which rises in norwegian lapland and passing through a vast extent of country empties itself into the gulf of bothnia is one of those objects says mr wraxhall which to be felt must be seen and before which all language sinks unequal a small island or rather a rock of half a quarter a mile in circumference divides the river at this place in the winter when one of the cataracts is frozen over the island is accessible but at other times it would be impossible to reach it alive the eye takes in both falls at once from either bank the depth of each is about forty feet but one is a direct perpendicular the other oblique and shelving the breadth of each about ninety yards the tremendous roar of these cataracts which close to them is greater far than the loudest thunder the spray which rises incessantly from them and even in many parts obscures them from the eye the agitation of the river below for several hundred yards before it resumes its former tranquillity and the sides covered with tall firs which seem to be silent spectators of it form one of the most picturesque and astonishing scenes to be beheld in natures volume nor would i have resigned the pleasure i experienced as i lay on the loose stones immediately below it and was covered with the spray from its dashing billows for the most voluptuous banquet a sovereign could bestow incautious fishermen are sometimes carried down the torrent hurled on this precipice and meet their death below  sweden though a very mountainous country affords a great many tracts of even ground fit for agriculture the soil in general is sandy swampy or ferruginous but is not void of fertility of all the provinces gothland produces the greatest quantity of grain this part of the country had anciently its own sovereign but was united to sweden in      sweden also affords good pastures and some orchards of fine fruit but is more famous for mines than for any other thing in thallande or the valeland there is less arable ground than in the other provinces but some good meadows and pastures the nordlands being full of rocks and mountains produce but little corn yet have some fertile spots for grazing lapland is still more in this predicament but finland is in most places very fertile though it is far from being well cultivated  finland which was the country of the vandals was also formerly governed by sovereigns of its own and at present has the title of a great duchy it contains about  000 square swedish miles but is not sufficiently peopled in proportion to its extent which would subsist three millions of laboring hands well whereas its population does not amount to one million  the climate of sweden is very healthful the winters are extremely cold and continue nine months in the year but the air is clear and salubrious and the inhabitants arm themselves against it with furs sheepskins etc which they wear as they can afford wraxhall who was there in may says it was as cold as in our december but as the winters approach with but little intervention of autumn so they depart suddenly without such a gradation of spring as we experience in england as soon as the sun has thoroughly thawed the land it is in order for tillage the power of the sun succeeding the winters frost with once ploughing sets all the weeds loose so that it is necessary to plough the land at the end of the summer before the frost sets in which in this case will naturally destroy the weeds and make the ground clean an experiment worth the trial with us though our climate will favor a springploughing  at stockholm the sun in the midst of summer is eighteen hours and a half above the horizon and for some weeks makes a continual day in winter the days are proportionably shorter the sun being up but five hours and a half which defect is so well supplied as to light by the moon the auroraborealis the whiteness of the snow clearness of the sky and the brilliancy of the stars that traveling by night is as usual as by day and journeys are begun in the evening as frequently as in the morning not to mention the twilight which in the north begins four or five hours before sunrise and lasts as long after sunset and thus affords a light sufficient for most of the necessary occasions of life at tornao at midsummer which is in north latitude    the sun does not set but may be seen at midnight with half its disk above the horizon in winter the want of the suns heat is supplied by stoves within doors and fires without and so necessary is good clothing against the severity of the cold that the common people are better habited than those of other parts of europe as the winters are severe the summers are very hot violent storms and rains are seldom seen and the sharp keen north wind serves only to purify and refresh the air  the swedish coasts are surrounded with innumerable capes islands and rocks so that an approach to land is dangerous these islands or rocks lie very near each other several thousand of them are inhabited and the people live chiefly by fishing  the lakes in sweden which are numerous contain also some thousands of islands there are twentythree lakes in east gothland twentyone in smoland and several in the other provinces the lake wetter is near  00 english miles in length and resembles rather a sea than a piece of inland water the wener is eightyfour english miles long and fortytwo broad twentyfour rivers empty themselves into it and only one flows from it many of these lakes are navigable and might be made much more so at a very little expense the maeler lake in lapland is seventytwo english miles long full of fish and is said to contain    0 islands its banks are so beautifully diversified with trees castles churches noblemens seats and other edifices as to afford many beautiful prospects the views says conset are not inferior to those of richmond or windsor large fields of luxurious corn and hills richly clothed with lofty trees especially oaks of an amazing size the beautiful and large lake wetter along the side of which the high road runs for several miles is skirted by many pleasant villages and in its center is an island fourteen or fifteen miles long forming one complete parish and a most delightful place of residence it is were it not for the intense cold and drifted snow a passage over the rivers and lakes in winter would be as much more commodious for the traveller as it is for the business and intercourse of the inhabitants who are safely conveyed over the ice in sledges at the rate of fifteen english miles an hour  woods and vast forests overspread much of the country and consist chiefly of pines fir beach alder juniper and some oak especially in the province of bleaking where the trees grow so thick and lie to rot where they fall that the ways are impassable they afford however plentiful and cheap firing and being generally very straight and tall are easily convertible into timber fit for all uses charcoal is not half so good as ours but is six times as cheap as in england  in finland they burn whole tracts of underwood by felling it in the spring letting it lie all the summer till it is dry then burning it and strewing the land with wheat etc before the ashes are cold they often plough the seed and ashes in together and if the season is a good one the crop will be from  00 to   0 fold in many parts of gothland the firs on the high road to stockholm form avenues as noble as those which are planted in the entrance to palaces or noblemens seats but in other parts a scanty soil says wraxhall where the utmost industry can only produce a sickly harvest covers the bosom of a vast expanse of rock which in many places appears bare and hideous or only gives birth to a number of firs which run up to a vast height on its naked surface and seem kindly lent by nature to hide in some measure her penurious and inhospitable aspect in delecarlia says marshal the country is so romantic that the view as far as the eye can command from the tops of the mountains is one vast range of mountain beyond mountain till you see the ridge that parts sweden from norway rising far above the common clouds the whole prospect is a thick woodland intersected with lakes and forming wonderful scenes strikingly awful and sublime the situation of the village of lyma continues the same author is greatly uncommon it lies within the bend of a river which is in fact a continued waterfall running over one ridge of rocks the moment it has passed another and making such an incessant noise as almost to stun the whole village immediately behind it rises a ridge of mountains whose tops in lowering weather reach above the clouds so that the appearance of these dreadful heights with the torrents tumbling at their feet is magnificent in the extreme i have viewed mountains says he rocks waterfalls and lakes in the north of england and in scotland but they are pigmies compared with these there is an impression in these scenes that strikes the spectator with a far superior degree of awe  the provinces of upland westmanland and nerike which i traversed says coxe in my way to gottenburg are esteemed the richest and finest parts of sweden and indeed i can hardly figure to myself a more variegated and pleasing scene than is exhibited by the general face of the country hills dales rocks and valleys small plains numerous lakes fertile meadows and arable land frequent country villages and scattered farmhouses are blended together with a constant and delightful variety thus sweden which some travelers forming their judgment merely from the few districts that fall under their immediate observations have discribed as a barren and ungenial soil is evidently not deficient in the most picturesque beauties of rural nature  it abounds in every species of the three natural kingdoms especially those of the fossile or mineral kind as chrystals amethysts topazes porphyry lapislazuli agates cornelian a reddish stone called violstein a greenish semipellucid stone asbestos coral lodestone touchstone limestone slate freestone beautiful petrifactions etc near nordkioping are large quantities of excellent white marble with beautiful green veins muscovy isingglass a rhomboidical spar white earth quicksilver leadore ceruse cobalt alum sulphur motherofpearl and fullersearth are also here found and in finland they have pearlfisheries of great value  but the great wealth of sweden arises from its mines and metals goldore has been discovered in smoland and pure silver is dug up in warmeland but the largest silver mine is near sala  the goldmine from      to      produced annually      gold ducats at  s  d sterling each and the produce of the silver mine at sala from      to      was   00 lothige marks per year each equal to nine ounces twelve pennyweights troy  at the above silvermine workmen are let down in baskets to the first landingplace which is  0  fathoms below the surface of the ground the roof there is as high as a church supported by vast arches of ore thence the descent is by ladders or baskets to the lowest mine above  0 fathoms they have no records so ancient as the first discovery either of this or the coppermine mentioned below which must needs have been the work of many ages the ore seldom yields above four per cent and requires great pains to refine it the water as well as the ore is drawn by mills and of its produce the king has the preemption paying one fourth less than the real value  the great coppermine at falun is  0 fathoms deep and of great extent and yields annually the value of  00000 l sterling of which the king has a fourth part in kind and a duty of    per cent on the remainder if exported unwrought  they have also a great number of ironmines and forges especially in the mountainous parts of the country where they have the convenience of watermills to work them and from these besides what they keep for their own use they export yearly to the value of  00000 l the ore says mr wraxhall who visited one of these mines at danmora in      is not dug as in our mines of tin and coal but is torn up by gunpowder this operation is performed every day at noon and is beyond conception tremendous and awful resembling subterraneous thunder or rather vollies of artillery discharged under ground the stones are thrown up by the violence of the powder to a vast height above the surface of the earth and the concussion is so great as to shake the surrounding earth or rock on every side i felt a pleasure corrected with terror as i hung over this vast and giddy hollow which is half an english mile in circumference and to the bottom of which the eye attempts in vain to penetrate i ventured however says mr wraxhall to descend into this mine and was let down with two men in a large deep basket fastened by chains to a rope and i am not ashamed to own that when i had got a good way down and found myself suspended between heaven and earth by a rope and looked down into the deep and dark abyss below me to which i could see no termination i shuddered with apprehension and half repented my curiosity but this was only a momentary sensation and before i had descended a hundred feet i looked round on the scene with very tolerable composure i was near nine minutes before i reached the bottom it being eighty fathoms or   0 feet the view of the mine when i reached it was awful and sublime in the highest degree the light of the day was faintly admitted into these subterraneous caverns in many places it was lost and flambeaus supplied its place i saw the frame of wood across some parts from one side of the rock to the other whereon the miners sat boring holes for the admission of the powder with as much unconcern as i could have felt in any ordinary employment though the least dizziness or even a failure in preserving their equilibrium must have made them lose their seat and dashed them to pieces against the rugged surface of the rock beneath the weather above was very warm but here ice covered the whole surface of the ground and i found myself surrounded with the colds of the most rigorous winter amid darkness and caves of iron in one of these which was a considerable way under the rock were eight wretches warming themselves round a charcoal fire and eating their little scanty subsistence produced from their miserable occupations i say miserable for it is little else than confinement for life in a horrid dungeon there are no less than   00 men here constantly employed and their pay only threepence english a day these mines were first opened in    0 and with little intermission have been worktill this time  the country in the village of upsal is chiefly a horrid desert covered with shapeless stones or with impenetrable woods incapable of cultivation and devoid of inhabitants the quantity of land in tillage does not bear the proportion of one to twenty nature has however made them in some degree amends for this parsimony by enriching their barren wastes with inexhaustable mines and the forges attendant on these mines are numerous each forge employing from four to fourteen hundred workmen in iron wherever there is a countryseat there is one of these ironworks and no people were ever more expert in working their materials than are the peasants of this country they will exert themselves almost beyond the power of man and strike the iron with such prodigious force and such quick repeated blows as to be envelloped in redhot sparks i had the pleasure continues mr wraxhall of viewing the whole process used to reduce the ore into iron and must own it was curious and instructive they first roast it in the air for a considerable time after which it is thrown into a furnace and when reduced to fusion is poured into a mould of sand about three yards long these pigs of iron are next heated in a forge and when redhot a piece is pinched off and beat to a less size with hammers this smaller piece is then formed into a bar by a great hammer of a tonweight raised by a watermill five of these mills says motraye who traveled through sweden in      and      annually work  000 shipunds of iron each shipund three cwt english  marshall who traveled through sweden in      and who enquired into the husbandry says a tolerable good farm of about  00 english acres will let for about    l sterling that though till lately sweden raised no wheat they now sow sufficient for their own consumption and the farmers find it as profitable to them as it is in other countries though their crops are not so plentiful in sheltered situations they have as in warmer climates on the best lands very fine crops and an acre will produce from one and a half to three quarters but they never sow wheat except in their best fields oats is their most general crop though they have a large produce of peace and beans but the article they are most deficient in is grass as few of the farmers know any thing of the artificial grass except clover and not a twentieth part of the kingdom raise corn the low grounds of sweden are generally converted into pasturage a kind of coarse meadow and many of them are little better than bogs and marshes they are however taking great pains in the state to improve their agriculture prohibiting the importation of corn affixing premiums for good conduct and improvements for draining of bogs cultivating wastes and breeding of cattle  in the woody parts of sweden though the ground is rich and fertile thickly covered with fine timber and provisions can be procured in the greatest plenty yet the seesimple of such an acre of land may be purchased for four shillings nothing wants a regulation more than the woods of this kingdom the waste that is made in cutting them both in timber and land being exceedingly great  there being so short a summer and no spring in this country the productions of the earth are more speedy in their growth than in other places in the beginning of summer the fields are stored with variety of flowers and strawberries rasberries and such kind of fruits grow on every rock melons are brought to perfection in their gardens in dry years but peaches apricots and other wallfruits are exceedingly scarce as are also apples pears and plumbs and those they have are not welltasted cherries they have of several sorts and some tolerably good and plenty of all kinds of roots the gardens about stockholm says motraye are very fine and notwithstanding the severity of the winter their greenhouses afford orange fig myrtle and other trees and plants and flowers of the most tender nature  the wild beasts of this country are bears wolves elks deer foxes hares weasels and squirrels of which the last three in the northern provinces change their color in wintertime to white there are but few parks and those indifferently stocked owing to the expense of supporting deer through their long winters swedish hunting scarce deserves the name for they surround the game and shoot and murder it as they can there is very little riding in the case either here or in germany they have no rabbits but such as are brought into the country as a curiosity and are kept tame  fowl both wild and tame are plentiful and good within land except seafowl which feed on and taste of fish the orre and chader are peculiar birds so are the hierpe and snoripa the orre resembles our black game in england but larger with a webbed foot the chader or kader is a remarkable fine bird as large as a common turkey the cock is black the hen of an orangecolour and not quite so large as the cock the hen generally lays about eight or ten eggs but the hierpe is reckoned the finest game that can be eaten in size it is like a young pidgeon in color black gray and white the snoripa is rather larger for the first two years turns white in winter and gray in summer like the hares afterward it remains always white it is a bird peculiar to swedish lapland says conset or the neighboring countries a single one once made its appearance within a hundred mile of stockholm and from the particular noise it made at night alarmed the country people who took it for the voice of a ghost and so much were they terrified by this invisible spirit that nothing could tempt the postboys after it was dark to pass the wood it frequented it was however found out at last by some gentlemen who ordered their gamekeepers to watch by moonlight to be the harmless snoripa these birds i have mentioned are reckoned great rarieties at stockholm where they are sent in winter and sold at great prices  they have also pheasants and partridges but not so goodflavoured as ours and in the woods of finland and lapland abundance of woodcocks but the better class of people being exceedingly fond of woodcocks eggs encourage the boors to rob their nests and this not only makes them scarce in many parts of sweden but even england and some other countries feel the ill effects of it pigeons also are very scarce the northern and desert parts abound with eagles hawks and other birds of prey where nature seems to call them as may be presumed from a large hawk belonging to the french king being shot some years since in the north of finland which had a gold ring round one leg with this inscription je suis an roy i belong to the king and on the other a similar one with these words duc de chevereuse me guard the duke de cheveureuse keeps me  their lakes and rivers are stored with a variety of good fish as salmon perch trout tench pike and also a fish called a streamling rather less than a pilchard which are salted barrelled up and sent to all parts of the country in the gulf of bothnia they catch a quantity of seals of which they make trainoil  the cattle as in all other northern countries are generally of a small size nor can the breed be improved as they naturally degenerate in cold climates their sheep yield but a very course wool fit only to make clothes for the peasants the horses especially the finnish though small as our ponies are hardy vigorous strong surefooted and good trotters and the soldiery pretend that in war they are not only able to resist but will break a body of the best german horse the riches of many of the farmers consist in large droves of black cattle many sheep and numerous herds of hogs they pay their rent in corn and cattle and their peasants in cattle hogs and the keep of cows which give a good deal of milk and are reckoned the most profitable cattle they keep  chap ii of the people and cities sweden in proportion to its extent is not sufficiently peopled of this says busching there is a remarkable instance in one place not the most northern part of the kingdom where are scarce   00 persons in the compass of     geographical square miles this want of population mr marshall attributes to the small number of farmers they being only peasants with land enough round they cottages for the subsistence of the people within them many of these little spots belong to them and none of their children will ever brook living in a worse manner than their fathers did so that a family in this situation is sure to have but one representative this prevents marriages among the sons for as they cannot have their own cottages and lands they live at home unmarried with the brother who inherits and thus little or no increase happens but by accident but if all these peasants lived in hired cottages without land as with us and the country was cultivated by great farmers these farmers would extend their farms employ these peasants till more land and what they could not expend they would export they would fix their sons in other farms and the country would be more populous  at present the country behind wassay quite to the whitesea through several russian provinces at the distance of  00 miles is nearly one continued forest and so thinly peopled that scarce one inhabitant is to be met with the whole way i traversed the province of smoland says coxe from gotheborg to carlscrone which is said to be the wildest and most uncultivated region of this kingdom and in the distance of     english miles only one place dignified with the name of a town presented itself the villages for the most part consisted of six or seven houses and sometimes where i stopped to change horses i found nothing but a single solitary cottage yet all through this seemingly inhospitable track i met with good roads tolerable accomodations and a cheerful and contented peasantry in smoland says wraxhall i have driven from one stage to another of    to    english miles without meeting or seeing a single person though i impatiently looked for them some learned swedes compute the number of the inhabitants of sweden and finland to about three millions others about two millions some parishes are so extensive that a peasant must travel many swedish miles to visit his next neighbor and some others are so large as to equal a whole province of holland though such a parish shall not have as many wretched cottages as there are towns in such a flourishing province mr coxe says that from an accurate survey in      the number of people amounted to     000 being an increase of more than half a million in  0 years  the swedes are robust hardy and vigorous and are inured to all kinds of hardships and fatigues which they undergo with cheerfulness and the peasants are a heavy plodding kind of people where they are not too much exposed to the weather their complexions are good and their hair like all other northern nations frequently inclined to yellow the women are of a just proportion have tolerable features and many are pretty with golden locks those who do not live by labor are generally fair those who do are as tawney as the laplanders for here the peasants make the women take a part in all their laborious employs they go to plough thresh the corn carry the water serve the bricklayer and carry loads as the men do with us  swedes in the court dress   the common people dress as do the natives of denmark those who are poor make their clothes of sheepskins with the wool on and go barefooted but are in general better habited than the poor of other countries the fashion is much the same with other european nations and like them in summer wear such clothes or stuffs as they can procure  the usual courtdress introduced into this country by the present king is like the ancient spanish a sash round the waist a sword large and full breeches roses at the knees and in the shoes the cloak of black cloth edged with red satin the jacket and breeches all black ornamented with red stripes and buttons the waistcoat sash pinks at the knees and roses for the shoes are of red satin the ladys dress is a blacksilk robe with slit sleeves puffed with a white gauze colored sash and ribbands this is the usual dress but on solemn occasions the men wear white cloth or satin lined or striped with red satin the women white silk or satin with colored ribbands and sash the men who have not been presented at court are dressed almost entirely in black without any red lining and ornaments and the women of the same description must not appear with the white gauze sleeves in other respects their attire is similar to that just described  the diet of people of condition is much the same with our own except that they drink freer they have a variety of wines without end and a profusion of dishes at their entertainments but show no taste in the arrangment or disposition of them the table groans beneath a number of covers all brought in at once and then left to cool during a meal of two hours and is followed with fruits and sweetmeats every dish after being cut up is handed about in rotation from one to another and every one helps himself and passes it to the next wine and all other liquors stand upon the table the rule is to help yourself without any kind of ceremony healths are not drank the ladies are particularly assiduous in filling the gentlemens glasses after dinner the cloth is not drawn as in england nor do the men sit after the women withdraw each gentleman conducts a lady to another suit of apartments where coffee is prepared tea about three hours after then cards and music or a walk till supper  but it is customary here to assemble round a sideboard previous to dinner and regale with bread cheese and butter and followed by both sexes with a bumper glass of brandy for in stockholm and other cold countries the custom of drinking prevails rather too much not only among the men but the women which though it doubtless originated from the severity of the climate is only worthy of the muscovites before the reign of their reformer peter when it was a regulation at all russian entertainments that ladies were not to get drunk before ten oclock at an entertainment at which sir harry lyddel was present one of the dishes served up was a pikepudding consisting of a pike dressed so as to resemble the taste of a custard and yet not lose the flavor of the fish  there being a scarcity of wheat in the northern parts of sweden the poor eat a sort of bread made of the bark of birch and pinetrees straw and roots the hackebrod or stampebrod is also very common it is made of the ears of corn cut from the stems minced small and afterward dried and ground the barkbread is made of the outerbark of fir first paring off the coarse knots then drying it till it becomes brown either in an oven or before the fire when it undergoes a fermentation so as to consume the resin this bark is then ground into meal and thus made into bread twice in the year they bake their bread in large round cakes which are strung upon files of sticks and suspended close to the cielings of their cottages they are so hard as to be occasionally broken with a hatchet but are not unpleasant the common drink of the peasants is beer but they have frequent recourse to maltspirits the lowpriced brandies here says conset are distilled from rye and ants a species of insect very plentiful in this country  the ant used on this occasion is a large black insect commonly found in small round hills at the bottom of the fir tree they not only distill them but eat them and consider them as highly palatable and pleasant as i was walking continues this author with a young gentleman in a wood near gottenburg i observed him sit down on one of these living hills which from the nature of its inhabitants i should rather have avoided and begin with some degree of alacrity to devour these insects first nipping off their heads and wings the flavor he declared was of the finest acid and rather resembling that of a lemon my young friend invited me to taste them but my antipathy to such kind of food overcame me in physic we are told these ants supply a resin an oil and an acid smoking is general among the second and lowest class of people after dinner  the houses of the peasants are built of wood and covered with shingles and though only of one story are much better than our mud or thatched cottages and are comfortable and commodious the room in which the family sleeps is provided with ranges of beds in tiers as in cabins of ships one above the other upon the wooden testers of the beds in which the women lie are placed others for the men into which they get by ladders their furniture is of their own

chairs tables beds etc are very decently cut and put together  as we shall have an opportunity of spearing more particularly of their houses dress etc in describing the chief towns we will say no more on this head at present but proceed to give some account of their principal cities etc  stockholm being the capital of the whole kngdom and the city where the court is held demands our first attention it is situated in    degrees  0 min north latitude at the junction of the baltic and the maeler lake and has thus the convenience of both salt and fresh water it is circuit computed from one gate to the other is two swedish miles and it stands partly on islands and partly on peninsulas and somewhat resembles the city of venice most of the streets are broad strait and regular and kept very clean and the marketplaces are spacious the public buildings are many and are great ornaments to the place it is considerably larger than copenhagen but its superiority of size results more from singularity of situation than any real advantage over copenhagen in extent it is built on seven small islands or rocks formed by the river and the suburbs extend on the main land a considerable way north and south a variety of contrasted and enchanting views are formed by numberless rocks of granite rising boldly from the surface of the water partly bare and craggy partly dotted with houses or feathered with wood the inequality of the ground renders almost all the streets steep and inconvenient for carriages and they are badly paved but the houses are lofty and handsome though chiefly composed of brick it is half as large again as it was in the reign of charles xii and in the new quarter there are many noble streets of a vast length  the harbor is an inlet of the baltic the water as pelucid as crystal and of such a depth that ships of the largest burden can approach the quay which is very broad near an english mile long and lined with spacious buildings and warehouses the harbor is large enough to contain a thousand sail of ships but with all its convenience the utility of its situation is diminished from its difficulty of communication with the sea here being no tides and the whole being frozen up four months in the year at the extremity of the harbor several streets rise one above another in form of an amphitheatre and the palace a magnificent building crowns the summit toward the sea about two or three miles from the city the harbor is contracted into a narrow straight and winding among high rocks is lost to the sight this with the prospect terminated with distant hills overspread with trees exhibits such singular views as is beyond the power of words to deliniate  this city carries the chief trade of the kingdom of course there is a face of business and activity on the public quay which in a town is far more lively than the perpetual rattle of coaches  the palace which stands in the center of the city and on the highest spot of ground on a hill very steep on every side commands a complete prospect of the metropolis the river and surrounding country it is a large quadrangular stone edifice elegant and stately in its style of architecture was begun to be built by charles xi continued under frederic and the late kings but is not yet quite completed it has within a citadel but badly fortified during the winter the whole royal family reside in it many of the apartments are splendidly furnished but these are three or four pair of stairs high the palace serving for many public uses and all the rooms of the first and second floor which are small being appropriated to the private meetings of the senate and the courts of judicature  the senate house where the public meetings of the privy council are held is a regular fine edifice and makes the best appearance of any in the town excepting in the suburbs where the houses are of wood painted red the generality of the buildings are of stone or brick stuccoed white there is also a public bank covered with copper as are the houses of the nobility and thus appear rich and beautiful to the eye the suburbs being mostly built of wood are liable to accidents from fire but to remove the danger as much as possible the city is divided into    wards and in each of these is a master and four assistants whose duty is to repair to the fire immediately with a number of porters and laborers they have also a firewatch in each churchsteeple and a bell is rung on the first appearance of any such calamity  the arsinal is a large building but by no means kept wellstored except it is with standards and trophies chiefly taken from the imperialists poles russians and danes and of these there are a great number among other curiosities here is the skin of the horse stuffed which carried gustavus adolphus at the battle of lutzen a boat made by peter the great at sardam and taken by a swedish vessel as it was conveying by sea to petersburgh and the clothes and hat worn by charles xii when he was shot in the trenches before frederickshall this coat is a plain blue uniform like that of a common soldier with gilt buttons yellow waistcoat and breeches and black cravat such as he has always been painted in the stockings are sewed to the breeches his boots are thick and large his gloves of white leather with stiff tops and reaching almost to the elbows the right hand glove considerably stained with blood the left only sprinkled with a few drops and part of a bracelet he wore that day a little bloody also  the royal stables and the great hospital also make some figure but the market must not be omitted butchers meat is sold in shambles on the shore whilst vegetables and other marketable commodities are exposed to sale in boats upon the water this is at once a singular and a pleasing sight the moving shops and variety of wares that are passing before the eye the mixed and busy multitude which crowd the surface of the water renders this a very agreeable scene something of this kind may be seen on the thames on the arrival of a large fleet in the pool  in this city there are upwards of  000 houses chiefly of stone four or five stories high built on piles it is computed to be as populous as bristol there are  0 churches covered with copper and superbly decorated with a great variety of splendid ornaments having lofty spires with musical bells in their steeples but no large bells in the church of st nicholas which is the largest and supported by marble pillars are a great number of tombs of different kinds of marble this church has a picture on the rightside of the altar upon the wall well painted describing paradise and hell reaching from the floor to the roof and is very rich in plate here is a chalice of beaten gold enriched with jewels which according to motraye is not worth less than  0000 crowns  in the church of ritterholm are the sepulchers of the kings of sweden the tomb of charles xii is a raised tomb of black marble with no other inscription than his name over it are laid in cast bronze a club and a lions skin  the government of this city is in the hands of a great stadtholder who is also a privycounsellor under him are two burgomasters who have different apartments in the palace and with these sit about twenty citycounsellors men in trade the city maintains a guard of  00 men and to support this and the public buildings they are empowered to levy a tax of from one pound to  0l annually on the traders according to their wealth  the king has several palaces one at the east end of ladugardsland built in      near it is a park and a fine orangery the park is almost surrounded with water it has a medicinal spring within and nothing can be more delightful than the beautiful disposition of the fine groves lawns and walks with which it is diversified there is another palace at carlsberg with a garden laid out in elegant taste and decorated with beautiful statues etc also another at ulrichsdal with a fine park and curious grotto a few miles from stockholm but the finest of all his palaces is at drotningholm about a swedish mile west of stockholm facing the south front is a large garden with a variety of fountains and on the north commanding a view of the shipping at sea the gardens however give us no idea of royalty they are laid out in the dutch taste and considering this place is the summer residence of the king it is wonderful they are not kept in neater order the palace is a stately fabric built with brick on the banks of the maeler lake and all the apartments demonstrate the fine taste of the owner who is the mother of the present king here is a great collection of antiquities from the ruins of herculaneum with a variety of gems and medals natural and roman curiosities here is is also a well collected library in every branch of science and two galleries of paintings one descriptive of the victories of charles x the other those of his son charles xi in the gardens the queendowager has lately built a little semicircular pleasurepalace fitted up in the chinese taste where whim and caprice form the predominant character and spread a grotesque air throughout the whole  the situation of stockholm says mr wraxhall is injudicious and improper for the capital of the kingdom the inhabitants assured him that the place owed its origin about  00 years ago to an accidental contingency the viceroy who governed the country at that time under christian ii of denmark determined to found a city and instead of fixing on a proper spot for the execution of his plan he very wisely set a large piece of wood afloat in the maeler lake resolving that at whatever place it stopped there should be his city a small island stopped the log in its way and the name of stockholm was given to it in consequence  there is something continues the same author uncommonly savage and inhospitable in the whole circumjacent country even at the latter end of the month of may when all nature animate and inanimate awakes from the long slumber of a polar winter every thing here is joyless and infertile and the rays of the sun are reflected from an expanse of stone which invests the city round on every side and from whose bosom no verdure springs to cheer the eye  the only amusement of any moment in stockholm seems to be an opera performed every thursday in swedish the building is handsome and large magently illuminated and the dresses of the actors are superb in winter the weather is too cold to seek amusement abroad and as soon as the ice and snow leaves the surface of the land every one that can afford a country house takes his amusement there they have a theater however in which french comedies are represented sometimes concerts and oratorios but the musical performers are germans and not much encouraged  this country was formerly involved in the grossest darkness of pagan idolatory and upsal was the seat of their superstitious worship it was also in ancient times the chief seat of the sovereigns of sweden and where they held their supreme tribunal the greatest sacrifices offered in all the northern provinces were brought to this place in the time of paganism and the most eminent heathenpriests had here their residence it was the most ancient town in the swedish highlands and the chief ornament of the whole country it is now a university and archiepiscopal see and a neat city though not large containing about  000 inhabitants and about   00 students the ground plot is extremely regular divided into two equal parts by a small rivulet and the streets are drawn at right angles from a central kind of square a few of the houses are built with brick and stuccoed but the generality are constructed with trunks smoothed into the shape of planks painted red and the roofs covered in with turf there is not a stoneedifice in it fach house has its small courtyard or garden old upsala the residence of the high priest of oden stood at a small distance from the present city which rose upon the ruins of the ancient one as it fell into decay the old palace by gustavusvasa was consumed by fire in   0  the remains which stand on an elevated spot and command a fine prospect of the adjacent country consist of one wing a small part of another and the principal front which has been repaired and covered with a red stucco the room in which the diet of sweden used to assemble is now converted into a granary   0 feet long and  0 broad and the few other apartments in the broken wing are used as a common gaol underneath are three dungeons formerly appropriated to stateprisoners  the city stands in an open plain under cultivation all around about thirty miles northwest of stockholm we have given a view of the entrance into it the building on the hill is an old castle fortified after the gothic manner consisting of many beautiful and lofty buildings chiefly of wood and commanding the whole city in the center of the town stands the cathedral a large brickbuilding the whole of gothic construction except two towers of later date ornamented with small marblepillars of the doric order and which disfigure the general symmetry of the other parts it is built in imitation of the church of notredame at paris in repairing this church lately upsal they have added a doric architrave to these gothic walls and placed two great domes of copper on the top in this cathedral lie entombed the ancient kings of sweden and among the rest the sepulcher that covers the venerable ashes of gustavus vasa it stands in a private chapel and is an oblong monument of marble with wooden pyramids at each angle one of which is taken away his figure is represented in marble between those of his first two wives the cathedral has an excellent organ beautifully ornamented and a very curious clock showing besides the hours the day of the month and week the remarkable motion of the heavenly bodies and all the fixed and moveable feasts near the altar are the remains of king eric enshrined in a silver box where they have rested undisturbed upwards of  00 years among other relics is an old log of wood rudely carved into the resemblance of a head scarcely human and called the image of their god tbor formerly worshipped in these parts and a ragged strip of linen fastened to a staff like a pair of colors called the shift of margeret which was carried in battle as the main standard in order to animate the troops by the recollection of her martial spirit  this town is particularly celebrated for its university the students of which are not men of family and condition as with us but are for the most part miserably poor and lodge five or six together not in cottages or appropriate buildings but in and about the town in wretched hovels amid dirt and penury but i shall have to speak of the university again  there is also at upsal a botanical garden founded by the celebrated linnaeus and about seven miles from the town a piece of antiquity the remains of several mutilated stones one of which is known in swedish history as the stone of mora upon which the sovereigns of sweden were annually elected enthroned and received the homage of their subjects they stand in an open plain and are covered with a brickbuilding to preserve them the names of the swedish kings there enthroned are inscribed on the stones and dated from      to      the stone of mora is placed in the midst of    other stones standing in a circle round it there is a similar monument near st buriens in cornwall which camden conjectures to have been some trophy of the romans under the later emperors or of athelstan the saxon after he had subdued cornwall or according to wormius this piece of antiquity in cornwall is where the ancient anglosaxon kings were elected and enthroned  gothenburg is next to stockholm the principal and most trading town in sweden it lies on the borders of westgothland at the mouth of the river moludal which lies close to the northside of the city and is carried by several canals through the town since      the greatest part has been rebuilt with stone the streets are broad and kept very clean it is a bishopssee has two printinghouses a seminary an orphanhouse and several docks its inhabitants are computed at   000 it has an east india company a squadron of menof war lies in the port and a constant garrison is kept in the city gothenburgh is the fourth in order among the towns which have a vote in the diet  mr coxe who was there lately gives the following description of it gothenburg is built in a very singular situation at a small distance from the sea is a marshy plain scarcely more than half a mile in breadth watered by the rivers gotha and moludal and almost entirely enclosed with high ridges of rocks so bare and rugged that they scarcely produce a single blade of grass and exhibit as barren an appearance as the summits of the loftiest alps gothenburg stands partly on the ridges and partly in this plain and divided by these different situations into the upper and lower town the latter is entirely level intersected by several canals in the manner of the dutch towns and its houses are all constructed upon piles the upper part hangs on the declivities and rows of buildings rise one above another like the seats of an amphitheatre the whole is regularly fortified and its circumference is near three miles exclusive of the suburbs the streets are all uniformly straight a few of the houses are of brick but the generality are of wood painted red and it has several tolerable churches the harbor is formed by two chains of rocks and is about a quarter of a mile broad its entrance from the north sea is defended by the fort of elfsborg which stands on a small rocky island and contains a garrison of   0 men  abo is another university the capital of swedish finland lying on the point where the gulphs of bothnia and finland unite it is the most considerable town in the whole country surrounded with hills and has a very commodious harbor it is a bishopssee has a handsome cathedral a royal highcourt of judicature and is the residence of the governor of the province the city which is not illbuilt has some few brickhouses but the generality are of wood painted red so as to resemble brick the university contains about  00 students and its library about  000 volumes here is also a school for  00 scholars and a tolerable trade carried on in linen corn provisions planks etc  tornao is another town of some note though small about   0 miles northeast of stockholm where a considerable commerce is carried on between the swedes and laplanders russians and norwegians and is frequently visited by strangers in order to see fin peasants the sun at midnight which may be observed by a spectator from the churchtower in summertime just above the horizon there is an annual fair held here frequented by the mountaineers who barter fruit and other commodities the produce of their country for hardware and other necessaries the fair continues a week and is considered as a kind of finland jubilee when they depart for their own mountains the arrangment of their deer and loaded pulchas or sledges makes a very singular appearance they do not travel in a mixed multitude without order but with much regularity and method precedence is always claimed and allowed to the senior the others follow in rotation which presents to the eye a procession of deer and sledges the uncouth figures of men and utensils of various kinds and shapes extending from seven to eight or nine miles in length the figure of a reindeer as described in the plate of upsal and that of the lapland women holding it were drawn from the life  tornao being situated on the confines of finland both the finnish and lapland languages are here spoken and the inhabitants though far distant from polished society are far from being an unpolished people it is a beautiful well built city consisting of three streets running parallel to each other from north to south intersected at right angles by    crossstreets or lanes the church is built with timber and all the houses have large oblong courts two sides of which are taken up with apartments the other two with stables barns etc all houses in the adjoining country are so constructed but those have their courtyards square  in the month of december mr maupertuis says this town on its approach has a most frightful appearance it is little houses are buried to the tops in snow which if there was any daylight would effectually shut it out but the snows continually falling or ready to fall hide the sun the few moments he might be seen at midday in the month of january rus mercurial thermometer which at paris in the great frost of   0  it was thought strange to see fall to    degrees below the freezingpoint was here fallen to    the spirit of wine in other thermometers was frozen if we opened the door says he of a warm room the external air instantly converted all the vapor into snow whirling it round in in white vortexes if we went abroad we felt as it the air was tearing our hearts to pieces and the cracking of the wood with which the houses are built as the violence of the cold splits it continually alarmed us with an approaching increase of cold the solitude of the  was no less than if the inhabitants had all been  and in this country you may often see  been maimed or have had an arm  off the ld which is always very great increases sometimes by such violent and sudden fits as are almost infallibly fatal to those that happen to be exposed to it sometimes sudden tempests of snow arise that are still more dangerous the winds seem to blow from all quarters at once and drive about the snow with such fury that in a moment all the roads are lost  the peasants of finland are a rougher kind of people than the swedes dress more like the russians but still differ from them in their look and their dress they have for the most part fair complexions and red hair they shave their beards wear their hair parted at top and hanging to a considerable length on their shoulders whereas the russians have generally dark complexions and hair wear their beards and cut their hair short  there is here a fine salmonfishery and their method of taking it is this they first form an enclosure  00 yards long and  00 broad by driving poles down into the water in the tartarmanner leaving only entrance for the salmon and this enclosure they drag with nets every two hours and catch from forty to fifty at a time a salmon of   lb weight may be bought here for  s  d english  but carlserone is reckoned the next best city in sweden to stockholm it lies in the balticsea about  00 miles from the capital and stands partly on a small island or two surrounded with other islands these with the woods of oak beach and birch on all sides render the place extremely pleasant here are two handsome churches and about    000 inhabitants it is famous for the admiraltycollege and dockyard separated from the town by a high stonewall and a squadron of ships of war is here laid up the dock is dug out of a mountain to the depth of  0 feet and is upwards of  00 feet long it is entrance toward the sea has sufficient depth of water to float the largest men ofwar it is closed by two floodgates and can be emptied in ten hours so as to become quite dry  the way into the town from the main land is over a dyke and from thence along two woodenbridges joined by a barren rock the suburbs are fortified toward the land by a stonewall a number of new docks were begun in      on a stupenplan worthy of the ancient romans but are not yet completed it is intended to construct  0 docks a large basin capable of holding two menofwar now finished is designed to communicate with two smaller ones from each of which are to extend like the radii of a circle five rows of covered docks each row to be separated by walls of stone and provided with gates so as to be filled or emptied by pumps close to the docks magazines for naval stores are to be constructed and the whole enclosed with a stonewall the ships of carlscrone are built chiefly by english artizans ships of very great burden are also built at tornao  having thus given my readers a description of the principal towns i will endeavor to furnish him with some idea of the seats of the nobility by describing from mr marshall that of m de verspot at ravesburg near horsten this nobleman had attended the government of sweden as a senator for twenty years but was now retired to his countryseat and amused himself with agriculture the situation of his house is very romantic it is a large quadrangular building round a court situated on the side of a vast mountain near the bottom but high enough to command a great view in front a large tract of falling ground parts the house from a very beautiful lake four miles long and one and a half broad in which are several lofty islands covered with wood on one of which m verspot has built a summer house enchantingly situated on the other sides of this lake the country is extremely various either irregular vales or hills rising very boldly and in general covered thick with wood the whole country belongs entirely to him for several miles every way on the side of one of the hills less steep than the rest he has built a new village of more than  0 houses which being all of a whitestone has a most cheerful appearance in the lake he has a small ship of two masts carrying ten brasscannon three sloops and various boats it put me more in mind says marshall of a noblemans ornamented seat in a wild part of britain than any place i had ever seen since i had left england and yet he had traveled through all flanders germany denmark and sweden  this gentleman alive in    0 lives in a very plentiful and elegant style his table is spread with all the delicacies which art can name in so northern a climate he has the finest wines in europe and his lake furnishes him with admirable fish his establishment may be guessed when it is said he has seventy menial servants in the house one of whom has the title of captain of the guard after the custom of sweden who has a table at which is the secretary and two chaplains and besides this there are five other tables kept at the lowest of which the peasants who please to come are indiscriminately admitted and their number is very often great even to some hundreds but that is only on festivals some however make free to visit him every day the house was built by himself the apartments are amazingly numerous and many of them very large the largest house says marshall belonging to a subject i ever saw there is a suite of eleven rooms fronting the lake not one less than forty feet long and thirty broad all wellfurnished each with two chimneypieces in the english taste the stoves are at each end of the room and in all these stoves and chimnies as well as in every room of the house are constant fires all the winter  i rode continues the same author about a mile and a half over this gentlemans improvements and found them ornamented the fields were all regularly disposed in squares or oblongs and in high cultivation the fences regular and admirable and all the gates rails etc in good order and painted white as in some of our ornamented farms in england the lands were covered with wheat barley oats peace beans buckwheat carrots turnips trefoil etc and meadowgrass superior to most english crops  from this princely residence of m verspot let us turn to the lot of a farmer in more humble life in the domain we have just visited we may judge of the swedish nobility though all are perhaps not so wealthy as m verspot yet all might be equally happy and respectable a nobleman who spends the greatest part of his time in the midst of his tenants with the benevolence and hospitality of a prince must feel his heart much more elated than he who fritters away his time and fortune in selfish amusements useless to himself and others  mr coxe who traveled through many parts of germany poland and russia tells us that in no kingdom except in england had he observed so many seats scattered over the face of the country as in sweden where gentleman of moderate fortunes as with us are accustomed to reside on their estates in rural plenty these seats being composed of an assemblage of wooden buildings and painted red make a neat appearance occupying a large extent of ground they look at some distance like small villages and contribute greatly to the ornament of the country they are most frequent near the lakes and are not uncommonly situated in the midst of hangingwoods or broken rocks suspended over the water
