enough of actors  let them play the playr and free from censure fret sweat strut and stare garrick abroad what motives can engage to waste one couplet on a barren stage ungrateful garrick when these tasty days in justice to themselves allowed thee praise when at thy bidding sense for twenty years indulged in laughter or dissolved in tears when in return for labor time and health the town had given some little share of wealth could thou repine at being still a slave dare thou presume to enjoy that wealth she gave could thou repine at laws ordained by those whom nothing but thy merit made thy foes whom too refined for honesty and trade by need made tradesmen pride had bankrupts made whom fear made drunkards and by modern rules whom drink made wits though nature made them fools with such beyond all pardon is thy crime in such a manner and at such a time to quit the stage but men of real sense who neither lightly give nor take offense shall own thee clear or pass an act of grace since thou have left a powell in thy place enough of authors  why when scribblers fail must other scribblers spread the hateful tale why must they pity why contempt express and why insult a brother in distress let those who boast the uncommon gift of brains the laurel pluck and wear it for their pains fresh on their brows for ages let it bloom and ages past still flourish round their tomb let those who without genius write and write versemen or prosemen all in natures spite the pen laid down their course of folly run in peace unread unmentiond be undone why should i tell to cross the will of

who write and greater fools who read what though they lay the realms of genius waste fetter the fancy and debauch the taste though they like doctors to approve their skill consult not how to cure but how to kill though by whim envy or resentment led they damn those authors whom they never read though other rules unknown one rule they hold to deal out so much praise for to much gold though scot with scot in damned close intrigues against the commonwealth of letters leagues uncensurd let them pilot at the helm and rule in letters as they ruled the realm ours be the curse the mean tame cowards

throne enough of patriots  all i ask of man is only to be honest as he can some have deceived and some may still deceive it is the fools curse at random to believe would those who by opinion placed on high stand fair and perfect in their countrys eye maintain that honor let me in their ear hint this essential doctrine  persevere should they which heaven forbid to win the grace of some proud courtier or to gain a place their king and country sell with endless shame the avenging muse shall mark each traitorous name but if to honor true they scorn to bend and proudly honest hold out to the end their grateful country shall their fame record and i myself descend to praise a lord enough of wilkes  with good and honest men his actions speak much stronger than my pen and future ages shall his name adore when he can act and i can write no more england may prove ungrateful and unjust but fostring france shall never betray her trust it is a brave debt which gods on men impose to pay with praise the merit even of foes when the great warrior of amilcars race made romes wide empire tremble to her base to prove her virtue though it galled her pride rome gave that fame which carthage had denied enough of self  that darling luscious theme over which philosophers in raptures dream on which with seeming disregard they write then prizing most when most they seem to slight vain proof of folly tinctured strong with pride what man can from himself himself divide for me nor dare i lie my leading aim conscience first satisfied is love of fame some little fame derived from some brave few who prizing honor prize her votries too let all nor shall resentment flush my cheek who know me well what they know freely speak so those the greatest curse i meet below who know me not may not

travel bound some riming guest roams through the churchyard whilst his dinners dressed let it hold up this comment to his eyes life to the last enjoyed here churchill lies whilst o what joy that pleasing flattery gives reading my works he cries  here churchill lives enough of satire  in less hardened times great was her force and mighty were her rimes i have read of men beyond mans daring brave who yet have trembled at the strokes she gave whose souls have felt more terrible alarms from her one line than from a world in arms when in her faithful and immortal page they saw transmitted down from age to age recorded villains and each spotted name branded with marks of everlasting shame succeeding villains sought her as a friend and if not really mended feigned to mend but in an age when actions are allowed which strike all honor dead and crimes avowed too terrible to suffer the report avowed and praised by men who stain a court proppd by the arm of power when vice highborn highbred highstationd holds rebuke in scorn when she is lost to every thought of fame and to all virtue dead is dead to shame when prudence a much easier task must hold to make a new world than reform the old satire throws by her arrows on the ground and if she cannot cure she will not wound come panegyric  though the muse disdains founded on truth to prostitute her strains at the base instance of those men who hold no argument but power no god but gold yet mindful that from heaven she drew her birth she scorns the narrow maxims of this earth virtuous herself brings virtue forth to view and loves to praise where praise is justly due come panegyric  in a former hour my soul with pleasure yielding to thy power thy shrine i sought i prayed  but wanton air before it reached thy ears dispersed my prayer even at thy altars whilst i took my stand the pen of truth and honor in my hand fate meditating wrath against me and mine chid my fond zeal and thwarted my design whilst hayter brought too quickly to his end i lost a subject and mankind a friend come panegyric  bending at thy throne thee and thy power my soul is proud to own be thou my kind protector thou my guide and lead me safe through passes yet untried broad is the road nor difficult to find which to the house of satire leads mankind narrow and unfrequented are the ways scarce found out in an age which lead to praise what though no theme i choose of vulgar note nor wish to write as brother bards have wrote so mild so meek in praising that they seem afraid to wake their patrons from a dream what though a theme i choose which might demand the nicest touches of a masters hand yet if the inward workings of my soul deceive me not i shall attain the goal and envy shall behold in triumph raised the poet praising and the patron praised what patron shall i choose shall public voice or private knowledge influence my choice shall i prefer the grand retreat of stowe or seeking patriots to friend wildmans go to wildmans cried discretion who had heard closestanding at my elbow every word to wildmans art thou mad can thou be sure one moment there to have thy head secure are they not all let observation tell all marked in characters as black as hell in doomsday book by ministers set down who style their pride the honor of the crown make no reply  let reason stand aloof  presumptions here must pass as solemn proof that settled faith that love which ever springs in the best subjects for the best of kings must not be measured now by what men think or say or do  by what they eat and drink where and with whom that questions to be tried and statesmen are the judges to decide no juries called or if called kept in awe they facts confessed in themselves vest the law each dish at wildmans of sedition smacks blasphemy may be gospel at almacks peace good discretion peace  thy fears are vain never will i herd with wildmans factious train never the vengeance of the great incur nor without might against the mighty stir if from long proof my temper you distrust weigh my profession to my gown be just do thou one parson know so void of grace to pay his court to patrons out of place if still you doubt though scarce a doubt remains search through my altered heart and try my reins there searching find nor deem me now in sport a convert made by sandwich to the court let madmen follow error to the end i of mistakes convinced and proud to mend strive to act better being better taught nor blush to own that change which reason wrought for such a change as this must justice speak my heart was honest but my head was weak bigot to no one man or set of men without one selfish view i drew my pen my country asked or seemed to ask my aid obedient to that call i left off trade a side i chose and on that side was strong till time has fairly proved me in the wrong convinced i change can any man do more and have not greater patriots changed before changed i at once can any man do less without a single blush that change confess confess it with a manly kind of pride and quit the losing for the winning side granting whilst virtuous sandwich holds the rein what bute for ages might have sought in vain hail sandwich  nor shall wilkes resentment show hearing the praises of so brave a foe  hail sandwich  nor through pride shall thou refuse the grateful tribute of so mean a muse  sandwich all hail  when bute with foreign hand grown wanton with ambition scourged the land when scots or slaves to scotsmen steered the helm when peace inglorious peace disgraced the realm distrust and general discontent prevailed but when he best knows why his spirits failed when with a sudden panic struck he fled sneaked out of power and hid his recreant head when like a mars fear ordered to retreat we saw thee nimbly vault into his seat into the seat of power atone bold leap a perfect connoisseur in statemanship when like another machiavel we saw thy fingers twisting and untwisting law straining where godlike reason bade and where she warranted thy mercy pleased to spare saw thee resolved and fixed come what come might to do thy god thy king thy country right all things were changed suspense remained no more certainty reigned where doubt had reigned before all felt thy virtues and all knew their use what virtues such as thine must needs produce thy foes for honor ever meets with foes too mean to praise too fearful to oppose in sullen silence sit thy friends some few who friends to thee are friends to honor too plaud thy brave bearing and the commonweal expects her safety from thy stubborn zeal a place amongst the rest the muses claim and bring this free will offering to thy fame to prove their virtue make thy virtues known and holding up thy fame secure their own from his youth upwards to the present day when vices more than years have marked him gray when riotous excess with wasteful hand shakes lifes frail glass and hastes each ebbing sand unmindful from what stock he drew his birth untainted with one deed of real worth lothario holding honor at no price folly to folly added vice to vice wrought sin with greediness and sought for shame with greater zeal than good men seek for fame where reason left without the least defense laughter was mirth obscenity was sense where impudence made decency submit where noise was humor and where whim was wit where rude untemperd license had the merit of liberty and lunacy was spirit where the best things were ever held the worst lothario was with justice always first to whip a top to knuckle down at taw to swing upon a gate to ride a straw to play at pushpin with dull brother peers to belch out catches in a porters ears to reign the monarch of a midnight cell to be the gaping chairmans oracle whilst in most blessed union rogue and whore clap hands huzza and hiccup out encore whilst gray authority who slumbers there in robes of watchmans fur gives up his chair with midnight howl to bay the affrighted moon to walk with torches through the streets at noon to force plain nature from her usual way each night a vigil and a blank each day to match for speed one feather against another to make one leg run races with his brother against all the rest to take the northern wind bute to ride first and he to ride behind to coin newfangled wagers and to lay em laying to lose and losing not to pay em lothario on that stock which nature gives without a rival stands though march yet lives when folly at that name in duty bound let subject myriads kneel and kiss the ground whilst they who in the presence upright stand are held as rebels through the loyal land queen every where but most a queen in courts sent forth her heralds and proclaimed her sports bade fool with fool on her behalf engage and prove her right to reign from age to age lothario great above the common size with all engaged and won from all the prize her cap he wears which from his youth he wore and every day deserves it more and more nor in such limits rests his soul confined folly may share but cannot engross his mind vice bold substantial vice puts in her claim and stamps him perfect in the books of shame observe his follies well and you would swear folly had been his first his only care observe his vices you will that oath disown and swear that he was born for vice alone is the soft nature of some easy maid fond easy full of faith to be betrayed must she to virtue lost be lost to fame and he who wrought her guilt declare her shame is some brave friend who men but little known deems every heart as honest as his own and free himself in others fears no guile to be ensnared and ruined with a smile is law to be perverted from her course is abject fraud to league with brutal force is freedom to be crushed and every son who dares maintain her cause to be undone is base corruption creeping through the land to plan and work her ruin underhand with regular approaches sure though slow or must she perish by a single blow are kings who trust to servants and depend in servants fond vain thought to find a friend to be abused and made to draw their breath in darkness thicker than the shades of death is gods most holy name to be profaned his word rejected and his laws arraigned his servants scorned as men who idly dreamed his service laughed at and his son blasphemed are debauchees in morals to preside is faith to take an atheist for her guide is science by a blockhead to be led are states to totter on a drunkards head to answer all these purposes and more more black than ever villain planned before search earth search hell the devil cannot find an agent like lothario to his mind is this nobility which sprung from kings was meant to swell the power from whence it springs is this the glorious produce this the fruit which nature hoped for from so rich a root were there but two search all the world around were there but two such nobles to be found the very name would sink into a term of scorn and man would rather be a worm than be a lord but nature full of grace nor meaning birth and titles to debase made only one and having made him swore in mercy to mankind to make no more nor stopped she there but like a generous friend the ills which error caused she strove to mend and having brought lothario forth to view to save her credit brought forth sandwich too gods with what joy what honest joy of heart blunt as i am and void of every art of every art which great ones in the state practice on knaves they fear and fools they hate to titles with reluctance taught to bend nor prone to think that virtues can descend do i behold a sight alas more rare than honesty could wish the noble wear his fathers honors when his life makes known they are his by virtue not by birth alone when he recalls his father from the grave and pays with interest back that fame he gave cured of her splenetic and sullen fits to such a peer my willing soul submits and to such virtue is more proud to yield than against ten titled rogues to keep the field such for that truth even envy shall allow such wyndham was and such is sandwich now o gentle montague in blessed hour did thou start up and climb the stairs of power england of all her fears at once was eased nor amongst her many foes was one displeased france heard the news and told it cousin spain spain heard and told it cousin france again the hollander relinquished his design of adding spice to spice and mine to mine of indian villainies he thought no more content to rob us on our native shore awed by thy fame which winds with open mouth shall blow from east to west from north to south the western world shall yield us her increase and her wild sons be softened into peace rich eastern monarchs shall exhaust their stores and pour unbounded wealth on albions shores unbounded wealth which from those golden scenes and all acquired by honorable means some honorable chief shall hither steer to pay our debts and set the nation clear nabobs themselves allured by thy renown shall pay due homage to the english crown shall freely as their king our king receive  provided the directors give them leave union at home shall mark each rising year nor taxes be complained of though severe envy her own destroyer shall become and faction with her thousand mouths be dumb with the meek man thy meekness shall prevail nor with the spirited thy spirit fail some to thy force of reason shall submit and some be converts to thy princely wit reverence for thee shall still a nations cries a grand concurrence crown a grand excise and unbelievers of the first degree who have no faith in god have faith in thee when a strange jumble whimsical and vain possessed the region of each heated brain when some were fools to censure some to praise and all were mad but mad in different ways when commonwealthsmen starting at the shade which in their own wild fancy had been made of tyrants dreamed who wore a thorny crown and with statebloodhounds hunted freedom down when others struck with fancies not less vain saw mighty kings by their own subjects slain and in each friend of liberty and law with horror big a future cromwell saw thy manly zeal stepped forth bade discord cease and sung each jarring atom into peace liberty cheered by thy allchearing eye shall waking from her trance live and not die and patronized by thee prerogative shall striding forth at large not die but live whilst privilege hung betwixt earth and sky shall not well know whether to live or die when on a rock which overhung the flood and seemed to totter commerce shivering stood when credit building on a sandy shore saw the sea swell and heard the tempest roar heard death in every blast and in each wave or saw or fancied that she saw her grave when property transferred from hand to hand weakned by change crawled sickly through the land when mutual confidence was at an end and man no longer could on man depend oppressed with debts of more than common weight when all men feared a bankruptcy of state when certain death to honor and to trade a sponge was talked of as our only aid that to be saved we must be more undone and pay off all our debts by paying none like englands better genius born to bless and snatch his sinking country from distress did thou step forth and without sail or oar pilot the shattered vessel safe to shore nor shall thou quit till anchored firm and fast she rides secure and mocks the threatening blast born in thy house and in thy service bred nursed in thy arms and at thy table fed by thy sage counsels to reflection brought yet more by pattern than by precept taught economy her needful aid shall join to forward and complete thy grand design and warm to save but yet with spirit warm shall her own conduct from thy conduct form let friends of prodigals say what they will spendthrifts at home abroad are spendthrifts still in vain have sly and subtle sophists tried private from public justice to divide for credit on each other they rely they live together and together die against all experience it is a rank offense high treason in the eye of common sense to think a statesman ever can be known to pay our debts who will not pay his own but now though late now may we hope to see our debts discharged our credit fair and free since rigid honesty fair fall that hour sits at the helm and sandwich is in power with what delight i view the wondrous man with what delight survey thy sterling plan that plan which all with wonder must behold and stamp thy age the only age of gold nor rest thy triumphs here  that discord fled and sought with grief the hell where she was bred that faction against her nature forced to yield saw her rude rabble scattered over the field saw her best friends a standing jest become her fools turned speakers and her wits struck dumb that our most bitter foes so much depends on men of name are turned to cordial friends that our offended friends such terror flows from men of name dare not appear our foes that credit gasping in the jaws of death and ready to expire with every breath grows stronger from disease that thou have saved thy drooping country that thy name engraved on plates of brass defies the rage of time than plates of brass more firm that sacred rhyme embalms thy memory bids thy glories live and gives thee what the muse alone can give these heights of virtue these rewards of fame with thee in common other patriots claim but that poor sickly science who had laid and drooped for years beneath neglects cold shade by those who knew her purposely forgot and made the jest of those who knew her not whilst ignorance in power and pampered pride clad like a priest passed by on the other side recovered from her wretched state at length puts on new health and clothes herself with strength to thee we owe and to thy friendly hand which raised and gave her to possess the land this praise though in a court and near a throne this praise is thine and thine alas alone with what fond rapture did the goddess smile what blessings did she promise to this isle what honor to herself and length of reign soon as she heard that thou did not disdain to be her steward but what grief what shame what rage what disappointment shook her frame when her proud children dared her will dispute when youth was insolent and age was mute that young men should be fools and some wild few to wisdom deaf be deaf to interest too moved not her wonder but that men grown gray in search of wisdom men who owned the sway of reason men who stubbornly kept down each rising passion men who wore the gown that they should cross her will that they should dare against the cause of interest to declare that they should be so abject and unwise having no fear of loss before their eyes nor hopes of gain scorning the ready means of being vicars rectors canons deans with all those honors which on mitres wait and mark the virtuous favorites of state that they should dare a hardwick to support and talk within the hearing of a court of that vile beggar conscience who undone and starved herself starves every wretched son this turned her blood to gall this made her swear no more to throw away her time and care on wayward sons who scorned her love no more to hold her courts on cams ungrateful shore rather than bear such insults which disgrace her royalty of nature birth and place though dullness there unrivaled state does keep would she at winchester with burton sleep or to exchange the mortifying scene for something still more dull and still more mean rather than bear such insults she would fly far far beyond the search of english eye and reign amongst the scots to be a queen is worth ambition though in aberdeen o stay thy flight fair science what
