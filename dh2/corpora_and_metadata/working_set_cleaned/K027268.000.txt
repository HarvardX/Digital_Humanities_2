in pall mall and sold by m cooper in paternoster row       advertisement the following odes were written at very distant intervals and with a view to very different manners of expression and versification the author pretends chiefly to the merit of endeavoring to be correct and of carefully attending to the best models from what the ancients have left of this kind perhaps the ode may be allowed the most amiable species of poetry but certainly there is none which in modern languages has been generally attempted with so little success for the perfection of lyric poetry depends beyond that of any other on the beauty of words and the gracefulness of numbers in both which respects the ancients had infinite advantages above us a consideration which will alleviate the authors disappointment if he too should be found to have miscarried  ode i allusion to horace  ego apis matinae more modoque etc lib iv od ii amid the gardens fragrance laid where yonder limes behold their shade along the glassy stream with horace and his tuneful ease i will rest from crowds and cares disease and summers piercing beam behold the busy wandering be from bloom to bloom from tree to tree she sweeps mellifluous dews for her the silken gems arise for her display their shining dies their balmy breath diffuse sweet murmurer may no rude storm this pleasurable scene deform to check thy gladsome toils still may the buds unsullied spring still showers and sunshine court thy wing to these ambrosial spoils nor shall my muse hereafter fail her fellowlabrer thus to hail and lucky be the strains for long ago did nature frame your seasons and your arts the same your pleasures and your pains like thee in lowly sylvan scenes and riverbanks and fruitful greens delights my vagrant song nor strives by soaring high in air though swans and eagles triumph there to draw the giddy throng nor where the rayen where the owl by night their hateful orgies howl will she her cares employ but flies from ruins and from graves prom ghostly cells and monkish caves to daylight and to joy nor will she tempt the barren waste nor deigns the ungrateful stores to taste of any noxious thing but leaves with scorn to others use the bitter hemlocks baneful juice the nettles fordid sting from all which nature fairest knows the vernal blooms the surnmer rose she draws her mingled wealth and when the lovely task is done she consecrates a double boon to pleasure and to health ode ii on the wintersolstice mdccxl the radiant ruler of the year at length his wintry goal attains soon to reverse the long career and northward bend his golden reins prone on potosis haughty brow his fiery streams incessant flow ripening the silvers ductile stores while in the caverns horrid shade the panting indian hides his head and often the approach of eve explores but lo on this deserted coast how faint the light how thick the air lo armed with whirlwind hail and frost fierce winter desolates the year the fields resign their cheerful bloom no more the breezes waft persume no more the warbling waters roll deserts of snow fatigue the eye black storms involve the louring sky and gloomy damps oppress the soul now through the town promiscuous throngs urge the warm bowl and ruddy fire harmonious dances festive songs to charm the midnight hours conspire while mute and shrinking with her fears each blast the cottagematron hears as over the hearth she sits alone at morn her bridegroom went abroad the night is dark and deep the road she sighs and wishes him at home but thou my lyre awake arise and hail the suns remotest ray now now he climbs the northern skies tomorrow nearer than today then louder howl the stormy waste be land and ocean worse defaced yet brighter hours are on the wing and fancy through the wintry glooms all fresh with dews and opening blooms already hails the emerging spring o fountain of the golden day could mortal vows but urge thy speed how soon before thy vernal ray should each unkindly damp recede how soon each hovering tempest fly that now fermenting loads the sky prompt on our heads to burst amain to rend the forest from the sleep or thundering over the baltic deep to whelm the merchants hopes of gain but let not mans unequal views presume on nature and her laws it is his with grateful joy to use the indulgence of the sovereign cause secure that health and beauty springs through this majestic frame of things beyond what he can reach to know and that heavens allsubduing will with good the progeny of ill attempers every state below how pleasing wears the wintry night spent with the old illustrious dead while by the tapers trembling light i seem those awful courts to tread where chiefs and legislators ly whose triumphs move before my eye with every laurel freshdisplayd while charmed i taste the ionian song or bend to platos godlike tongue resounding through the olive shade but if the gay wellnaturd friend bids leave the studious page awhile then easier joys the soul unbend and teach the brow a softer smile then while the genial glass is paid by each to her that fairest maid whose radiant eyes his hopes obey what lucky vows his bosom warm while absence heightens every charm and love invokes returning may may thou delight of heaven and earth when will thy happy morn arise when the dear place which gave her birth restore lucinda to my eyes there while she walks the wonted grove the seat of music and of love bright as the one primaeval fair thither ye silver sounding lyres thither gay smiles and young desires chaste hope and mutual faith repair and if believing love can read the wonted softness in her eye then shall my fears o charming maid and every pain of absence die then ofter to thy name attund and rising to diviner sound i will wake the free horatian song old tyne shall listen to my tale and echo down the bordring vale the liquid melody prolong ode iii against suspicion o fly it is dire suspicions mien and meditating plagues unseen the sorcress hither bends behold her torch in gall imbrued behold  her garments drop with blood of lovers and of friends fly far already in your eyes i see a pale suffusion rise and soon through every vein soon will her secret venom spread and all your heart and all your head imbibe the potent stain then come the hours of shame and fear then hints of horror seize your ear while gleams of lost delight raise the deep discord of the brain as lightning shines along the main through whirlwinds and through night no more can faith or candor move but each ingenuous deed of love which once you would applaud now smiing over her dark distress malignant fancy longs to dress like injury and fraud farewell to virtues peaceful times for soon you will stoop to act the crimes you thus can stoop to fear when vice begins her ugly train with wrongs of such unmanly stain what horrors form the rear it is thus to work her baleful power suspicion waits the sullen hour of fretfulness and strife when care the infirmer bosom wrings or eurus shakes his gloomy wings to damp the seats of life but come forsake the scene unblest which first beheld your candid breast to groundless fears a prey come where with my prevailing lyre the skies the streams the groves conspire to charm your doubts away throned in the suns descending car what power unseen diffuses far this tenderness of mind what genius smiles on every flood what god in whispers from the wood bids every heart be kind o thou whatever thy awful name whose breath awaked the immortal flame that moves my active veins thou who by fair affections ties have doubled all my future joys and half disarmed my pains let universal candor still clear as yon heavnreflefting rill preserve my open mind nor this nor that mans crooked views one mean or cruel doubt infuse to injure human kind ode iv to a gentleman whose mistress had married an old man indeed my phaedria if to find that gold a females vow can gain if this had ever disturbed your mind or cost one serious moments pain i should have said that all the rules you learnt of moralists and schools were very useless very vain yet i perhaps mistake the case and though with this heroic air like one that holds a nobler chase you seem the ladys loss to bear perhaps your heart belied your tongue and thinks my censure mighty wrong to count it such a flight affair when hesper gilds the shaded sky slow wandering through the wellknown grove methinks i see you cast your eye back to the morningscenes of love her tender look her graceful way the pretty things you heard her say afresh your struggling fancy move then tell me is your soul entire does wisdom calmly hold her throne then can you question each desire bid this remain and that begone no tear halfstarting from your eye no kindling blush you know not why no stealing sigh or stifled groan away with this unmanly mood see where the hoary churl appears whose hand has seized the favorite good which you reserved for happier years while side by side the blushing maid shrinks from his visage halfafraid spite of the sickly joy she wears ye guardian powers of love and fame this chaste harmonious pair behold and thus reward the generous flame of all who barter vows for gold o bloom of youth and opening charms wellburied in a dotards arms o worthy price of beauty sold cease then to gaze unthankful boy let let her go the venal fair unworthy she to give you joy then wherefore should she give you care lay lay your myrtle garland down and let the willows virgincrown with happier omens bind your hair o just escaped the faithless main though driven unwilling on the land to guide your favored steps again behold your better genius stand where platos olive courts your eye where hamdens laurel blooms on high he lists his heaven directed hand when these are blended on your brow the willow will be named no more or if that lovedeserted bough the pitying laughing girls deplore yet still shall i most freely swear your dress has much a better air than all that ever bridegroom wore ode v hymn to cheerfulness the author sick how thick the shades of evening close how pale the sky with weight of snows haste light the tapers urge the fire and bid the joyless day retire  alas in vain i try within to raise the dull dejected scene while roused by grief these fiery pains tear the frail texture of my veins while winters voice that storms around and yon deep deathbells groaning sound renew my minds oppressive gloom till starting horror shakes the room is there in nature no kind power to sooth afflictions lonely hour to blunt the edge of dire disease and teach these wintry shades to please come cheerfulness triumphant fair shine through the painful cloud of care o sweet of language mild of mein o virtues friend and pleasures queen assuage the flames that burn my breast attune my jarring thoughts to rest and while thy gracious gifts i feel my song shall all thy praise reveal as once it was in astraeas reign the vernal powers renewed their train it happened that immortal love was ranging through the spheres above and downward hither cast his eye the years returning pomp to spy he saw the radiant god of day lead round the globe the rosy may the fragrant airs and genial hours were shedding round him dews and flowers before his wheels aurora past and hespers golden lamp was last but fairest of the blooming throng when health majestic moved along all gay with smiles to see below the joys which from her presence flow while earth inlivend hears her voice and fields and flocks and swains rejoice then mighty love her charms confessed and soon his vows inclined her breast and known from that auspicious morn the pleasing cheerfulness was born thou cheerfulness by heaven designed to rule the pulse that moves the mind whatever fretful passion springs whatever chance or nature brings to strain the tuneful poize within and disarrange the sweet machine thou goddess with a masterhand do each attemperd key command refine the soft and swell the strong till all is concord all is song fair guardian of domestic life best banisher of homebred strife nor sullen lip nor taunting eye deform the scene where thou art by no sickening husband damns the hour that bound his joys to female power no pining mother weeps the cares that parents waste on hopeless heirs the officious daughters pleased attend the brother rises to the friend by thee their board with flowers is crowned by thee with songs their walks refound by thee their sprightly mornings shine and eveninghours in peace decline behold the youth whose trembling heart beats high with loves unpitied smart though now he strays by rills and bowers and weeping wears the lonely hours or if the nymph her audience deign shames the soft story of his pain with flavish looks discolored eyes and accents faltring into sighs yet thou auspicious power with ease catst yield him happier arts to please exalt his mein to manlier charms instruct his tongue with nobler arms with more commanding passion move and teach the dignity of love friend to the muse and all her train for thee i court the muse again and may the votive lay disclose how much to thy fair aid she owes see when thy touch reveals her mine how pure the stores of fancy shine hark when thy breath her song impells how full the tuneful current swells let melancholys plaintive tongue instruct the nightly strains of y but thine was homers ancient might and thine victorious pindars flight thy myrtles crowned the alcaeus and sappho lesbian meads thy voice awaked theocritus sicilian reeds thy breath perfumes the anacreon teian rose and tiburs vine spontaneous flows while horace wantons in thy quire the gods and heroes of the lyre see where the pale the sickening sage a prey perhaps to fortunes rage perhaps by tender griefs oppressed or glooms congenial to his breast retires in desartscenes to dwell and bids the joyless world farewell alone he treads the autumnal shade alone beneath the mountain laid he sees the nightly damps arise and gathering storms involve the skies he hears the neighboring surges roll and raging thunders shake the pole then struck by every object round and stunned by every horrid sound he pants to traverse natures ways his evils haunt him through the maze he views ten thousand demons rise to wield the empire of the skies and chance and fate assume the rod and malice blots the throne of god  o thou whose pleasing power i sing thy lenient influence hither bring compose the storm dispel the gloom till nature wear her wonted bloom till fields and shades their sweets exhale and music swell each opening gale then over his breast thy softness pour and let him learn the timely hour to trace the worlds benignant laws and judge of that presiding cause who founds in discord beautys reign converts to pleasure every pain subdues the hostile forms ta rest and bids the universe be blessed o thou whose pleasing power i sing if right i touch the votive string if equal praise i yield thy name still govern thou thy poets flame still with the muse my bosom share and sooth to peace corroding care but most exert thy genial power on friendships consecrated hour and while my agis leads the road to fearless wisdoms high abode or warm in freedoms sacred cause pursues the light of grecian laws attend and grace our generous toils with all thy garlands all thy smiles but if by fortunes stubborn sway from him and friendship torn away i court the muses healing spell for griefs that still with absence dwell do thou conduct my fancys dreams to such indulgent tender themes as just the struggling breast may cheer and just suspend the starting tear yet leave that charming sense of woe which none but friends and lovers know ode vi on the absence of the poetic inclination queen of my songs harmonious maid why why have thou withdrawn thy aid why thus forsook my widowed breast with dark infeebling damps oppressed where is the bold prophetic heat with which my bosom wont to beat where all the bright mysterious dreams of haunted shades and tuneful streams that wooed my genius to divinest themes say can the purple charms of wine or young diones form divine or flattering scenes of promised fame relume thy faint thy dying flame have soft melodious airs the power to give one free poetic hour or from amid the elysian train the soul of milton shall i gain to win the back with some celestial strain o mighty mind o sacred flame my spirit kindles at his name again my laboring bosom burns the muse the inspiring muse returns such on the banks of tyne confessed i hailed the bright ethereal guest when first she sealed me for her own made all her blissful treasures known and bade me swear to follow her alone ode vii to a friend on the hazard of falling in love no foolish boy  to virtuous fame if now thy early hopes be vowed if true ambitions nobler flame command thy footsteps from the crowd lean not to loves enchanting snare his dances his delights beware nor mingle in the band of young and fair by thought by dangers and by toils the wreath of just renown is worn nor will ambitions awful spoils the flowery pomp of ease adorn but love dissolves the nerve of thought by love unmanly fears are taught and loves reward with slothful arts is bought true where the muses where the powers of softer wisdom easier wit assist the graces and the hours to render beantys praise complete the fair may then perhaps impart each finer sense each winning art and more than schools adorn the manly heart if then from loves deceit secure such bliss be all thy heart intends go where the whitewingd eveninghour on delias vernal walk descends go while the pleasing peaceful scene becomes her voice becomes her mien sweet as her smiles and as her brow serene attend while that harmonious tongue each bosom each desire commands apollos lute by hermes strung and touched by chaste minervas hands attend i feel a force divine o delia win my thoughts to thine that half thy graces seem already mine yet conscious of the dangerous charm soon would i turn my steps away nor often provoke the lovely harm nor once relax my reasons sway but thou my friend  what sudden sighs what means the blush that comes and flies why stop why silent why avert thy eyes so soon again to meet the fair so pensive all this absent hour  o yet unlucky youth beware while yet to think is in thy power in vain with friendships flattering name thy passion masks its inward shame friendship the treacherous fuel of thy flame once i remember tired of love i spurned his hard tyrannic chain yet won the haughty fair to prove what sober joys in friendship reign no more i sighed complained or swore the nymphs coy arts appeared no more but each could laugh at what we felt before wellpleased we passed the cheerful day to unreservd discourse resigned and i enchanted to survey one generous womans real mind but soon i wondered what possessed each wakeful night my anxious breast no other friendship ever had broke my rest fool that i was  and now even now while thus i preach the stoic strain unless i shun diones view an hour unsays it all again o friend  when love directs her eyes to pierce where every passion lies where is the firm the cautious or the wise ode viii on leaving holland adieu to leydens lonely bound the belgian muses sober seat where shedding frugal gifts around on all the favorites at her feet she feeds the bodys bulky frame for passive persevering toils and left for some ambitious aim the daring mind should scorn her homely spoils she breathes maternal foggs to damp its restless flame adieu the grave pacific air safe from the flitting mountainbreeze the marshy levels lank and bare sacred from furrows hills or trees adieu each mantling fragrant flood untaughto to murmur or to flow adieu the the frogs music of the mud that sooths at eve the patient lovers woe and wakes to sprightlier thoughts the painful poets blood with looks so frosty and with steps so tame ye careful nymphs ye household things adieu not once ye taught me loves or friendships flame and where is he that ever taught it you and ye the sloweyd fathers of the land with whom dominion lurks from hand to hand unownd undignified by public choice i go where freedom in the streets is known and tells a monarch on his throne tells him he reigns he lives but by her voice o native albion when to thee shall i return to part no more far from this pale discolored sea that sleeps upon the reedy shore when shall i plow thy azure tides and as thy fleecewhite hills aspire bless the fair shade that on their sides imbowrs the village and the sacred spire while the green hedge below the golden slope divides ye nymphs that guard the pathless grove ye blueeyd sisters of the streams with whom i wont at morn to rove with whom at noon i talked in dreams o take me to your haunts again the rocky spring the greenwood glade to prompt my slumbers in the murmuring shade and sooth my vacant ear with many an airy strain and thou my faithful harp no longer mourn thy drooping masters unpropitious hand now brighter skies and fresher gales return now fairer maids thy melody demand daughters of albion guard your votive lyre o blooming god of thespias laurelld quire why sounds not mine harmonious as thy own when all the virgindeities above with venus and with juno move in concert round thy listming fathers throne thee too protectress of my lays elate with whose majestic call above the soft italians praise above the slavish wreaths of gaul i dare from impious thrones reclaim and wanton sloths luxurious charms the honors of a poets name to the earl of shaftsbury ashleys wisdom or to hamdens arms thee freedom i rejoin and bless thy genuine flame great citizen of albion thee heroic valor still attends and useful science pleased to see how art her studious toil extends while truth diffusing from on high a luster unconfined as day fills and commands the public eye till pierced and sinking by her powful ray tame sloth and monkish awe like nightly demons fly hence all the land the patriots ardour shares hence dread religion smiles with social joy hence the free bosoms softest loveliest cares each graceful scene of private life employ o fair britannia hail  with partial love the tribes of men their native seats approve unjust and hostile to a foreign fame but when from generous minds and manly laws a nation holds her prime applause there public zeal defies the test of blame ode ix to sleep thou silent power whose balmy sway charms every anxious thought away in whose divine oblivion drowned fatigue and toiling pain grow mild love is with sweet success beguiled and sad remorse forgets her secret wound o whither have thou flown indulgent god god of kind shadows and of healing dews over whom do thou extend thy magic rod around what peaceful couch thy opiate airs diffuse lo midnight from her starry reign looks awful down on earth and main the tuneful birds lie hushed in sleep with all that crop the verdant food with all that skim the crystal flood or haunt the cayerns of the rocky steep no rushing winds disturb the tufted bowrs no wakeful sound the moonlight valley knows save where the brook its liquid murmur pours and lulls the waving scene to more profound repose o let not me thus watch alone o hear my solitavy moan descend propitious on my eyes not from the couch that bears a crown not from the statesmans thorny down or where the miser and his treasure lies bring not the shapes that break the murdrers rest nor those the hireling soldier burns to see nor those that haunt the tyrants gloomy breast far be their guilty nights and far their dreams from me nor yet those awful joys present for chiefs and heroes only meant the figured brass the choral song the rescued peoples glad applause the listening senate and the laws bent on the dictates of after timoleon had delivered syracuse from the tyranny of dionysius the people on every important deliberation sent for him into the public assembly asked his advice and voted according to his decision plutarch timoleons tongue are scenes too grand for fortunes private ways and though they shine to youths ingenuous view the sober gainful arts of modern days to such romantic thoughts have bid a long adieu blessed be my fate i need not pray that lovesick dreams be kept away no female charms of fancy born nor damask cheek nor spaikling eye with me the bands of sleep untie or steal by minutes half the sauntring morn nor yet the courtiers hope the giving smile a lighter phantom and a baser chain bids wealth and place the feverd night beguile to gall my waking hours with more vexatious pain but morpheus on thy dewy wing such fair auspicious visions bring as soothed great miltons injured age when in prophetic dreams he saw the tribes unborn with pious awe imbibe each virtue from his heavenly page or such as meads benignant fancy knows when healths kind treasures by his art explored have saved the infant from an orphans woes or to the trembling fire his ages hope restored ode x on lyric poetry once more i join the thespian quire and taste the inspiring fount again o parent of the grecian lyre admit me to thy secret strain  and lo with ease my step invades the pathless vale and opening shades till now i spy her verdant seat and now at large i drink the sound while these her offspring listening round by turns her melody repeat i see anacreon smile and sing his silver tresses breathe persume his cheek displays a second spring of roses taught by wine to bloom away deceitful cares away and let me listen to his lay while flowfy dreams my soul employ while turtlewingd the laughing hours lead hand in hand the festal powers lead youth and love and harmless joy broke from the fetters of his native land devoting shame and vengeance to her lords with louder impulse and a

though now you glory in your lust though now you tread the feeble neck in dust yet time and righteous jove will judge your dreadful cause but lo to sapphos mournful airs descends the radiant queen of love she smiles and asks what fonder cares her suppliants plaintive measures move why is my faithful maid distressed who sappho wounds thy tender breast say flies he  soon he shall pursue shuns he thy gifts  he too shall give slights he thy sorrows  he shall grieve and bend him to thy haughtiest vow but o melpomene for whom awakes thy golden shell again what mortal breath shall ever presume to echo that unbounded strain majestic in the frown of years behold the pindar man of thebes appears for some there are whose mighty frame the hand of jove at birth endowed with hopes that mock the gazing crowd as eagles drink the noontide flame while the dim raven beats his weary wings and clamours far below  propitious muse while i so late unlock thy hallowed springs and breathe whatever thy ancient airs infuse to polish albions warlike ear this longlost melody to hear thy sweetest arts employ as when the winds from shore to shore through greece thy lyres persuasive language bore till towns and isles and seas returned the vocal joy but often amid the grecian throng the looserobd forms of wild desire with lawless notes intund thy song to shameful steps dissolved thy quire o fair o chaste be

invoked at softer hours o seek with me the happy bowers that hear dione s gentle tongue to beauty linked with virtues train to love devoid of jealous pain there let the sapphic lute be strung but when from envy and from death to claim a hero bleeding for his native land or when to nourish freedoms vestal flame i hear my genius utter his command nor theban voice nor lesbian lyre from thee o muse do
