hounds meet the sweetbreathing morn whilst full to the welkin their notes clear and shrill join the sound of the heartchearing horn what music celestial when urging the race sweet echo repeats to the chase to the chase our pleasure transports us  how gay flies the hour sweet health and quick spirits attend not sweeter when evening convenes to the bower and we meet the loved smile of a friend see the stag just before us he starts at the cry he stops  his strength fails  speak my friends  must he die his innocent aspect whilst standing at bay his expression of anguish and pain all plead for compassion  your looks seem to say let him bound over his forests again quick release him to dart over the neighboring plain let him live let him bound over his forests again   the gay expansion of my heart this morning and the flow of good humor which i can scarce express seem propitious to the poor stag if a hunters enthusiasm does not check it   enter marian but seeing sir henry she retires sir h come here marian  what is the matter my little girl you dont seem so gay as usual   marian sighing no sir   sir h pray tell me does anything vex you a sweetheart perhaps    marian no sir he never vexed me in his life   sir h then you have a sweetheart pretty marian   marian i had sir there is nobody to blame but my father he consented i should have edward and was impatient if he did not see him come running over the lea every evening at foldingtime but now my father has changed his mind and says i must hold my head higher   sir h and why has he changed his mind marian   marian because i am grown rich sir my godmother has left me three hundred pounds for a portion and that is the cause of all my misfortunes   sir h where is your father marian   marian gone to lincoln with some sheep sir but i expect him home very early   sir h perhaps i may be able to serve you marian  send your father to me as soon as he returns   marian if your honor could but persuade my father to take the

present  didnt i see her look back at you twenty times last night at folding of the lambs as she walked slowly toward home leaning on her fathers arm   edward i wish i could believe you robin and surely a mind like hers must be incapable of falsehood  song  edward who can suspect sweet marians faith that hears her softly speak or doubt the candid blush of truth which mantles on her cheek those accents never can deceive no guile that bosom knows pure as the untainted breath of morn and chaste as falling snows unheeded passed the dancing hours which saw our growing flame the grove the dell the fanning breeze the glow of noon the same but now no more the dell delights the grove or fanning breeze the taste of natures genuine charms demands the mind at ease    robin and why shoudnt your mind be at ease odds heart youre enough to spoil all the girls in the parish  now i will tell you my way  i axd patty what time i should bring the boat and she said as how she had rather come round over the brig so i shall even let her come round over the brig   thomas and repent it when you have done like enough  i could not have served my fanny so  but where will you find two prettier lasses than patty or fanny or two truer suitors than robin and i  nay for that matter who so happy as we country lads  song  thomas how blessed our condition how jocund our day ye swains can our pleasures be told to range in sweet order the rows of new hay to lead the strayed lamb to the fold to fetch up the kine for the maiden we love and guard her from noons burning beam to guide her dear steps when she leads through the grove the heifer which pants for the stream to carry her pail when with milk it overflows to wait while she rests on the style to gather the kingcup the woodbine and rose to make her a posy the while it is fanny the lovely who causes my smart it is she does all maidens excel if you ask her dear name who has conquered my heart it is fanny the pride of the dell it is fanny sweet fanny it is fanny sweet fanny the pride of the dell    robin here comes pretty marian dont be shy nor mind her vagaries sit down on the style and make as if you did not see her  thomas and i will step

because he has ten acres of land besides the ferry and a vote in the country and milks four cows but i will not marry robin nor anybody but edward   edward how could i be so unjust marian   marian my father values wealth but for me the kindness of my honored godmother is only welcome in the hope of sharing it with edward looking down and playing with the strings of her hat   edward i know my marians generous bosom well therefore though i was so unjust to doubt her constancy i never had the meanness to suspect any acquisition of fortune could occasion it   enter robin from the house robin yonder is your father marian hobbling along toward the grange  whip over the style  go the nearest way and be at home before him  exit marian led off by edward reenter edward with thomas robin takes edwards hand didnt i tell you my lad that marian loved you  why you have got quite another face man   edward how different looks the whole scene around me nature now resumes all her charms  song  edward ye happy pairs sincere and kind it is here you taste each joy refined fair truth and love delight to dwell at yonder cottage on the dell light as the fairy step at morn swift passing over the unbending corn all other pleasures weakly move the heart awake to generous love how dear sweet marians artless sighs hers the mild eloquence of eyes when constancys allcheering ray drives every jealous thought away far hence be doubt and tender fears how blessed the life which love endears when truth informs the glowing cheek o love thy transports who can speak    enter servant whispers edward and exit robin where did you leave the lasses thomas   thomas in the market but they will soon be here they only stop at the cherryholt on the other side of the water to get some fresh cherries and posies to sell at the fair william and i promised to meet them at the brig   robin you see thomas every one to his liking edward is inveigled by marians brown locks  you love fanny the pindars daughter and i am in love with patty clover we fancied one another when bairns  i liked her before i knew what liking was  song  robin when little on the villagegreen we played i learnt to love her she seemed to me some fairy queen so light trippd patty clover with every simple childish art i tried each day to move her the cherry plucked the bleeding heart to give to patty clover the fairest flowers to deck her breast i chose an infant lover i stole the goldfinch from its nest to sing to patty clover   exeunt through parkgate robin thomas let us have a drink it is a main good thing after

without remorse the rose without the thorn is my pursuit  yet i cannot convince the girls of this even the lively patty whom i should think less apprehensive if she meets me alone darts from me with the swiftness of a lapwing she reminds me of that beautiful ode of horace which a very slight alteration makes exactly to my purpose  air  sir henry patty flies me like a fawn which through some sequestered lawn panting seeks the mother deer not without a panic fear of the gently breathing breeze and the motion of the trees  over the cool sequestered lawn patty flies me like a fawn if the curling leaves but shake if a lizard stir the brake frighted it begins to freeze trembling both at heart and knees thus alarmed with causeless fear fancy paints a lover near whilst along the dewy lawn patty flies me like a fawn    enter robin with a jug and thomas at the door bowing sir h come here robin  what time does your little fair on the green begin  i intend to be there and give the girls fairings   robin at one oclock your honor and ends at milking time we have been drinking your honors good health shows the jug   sir h i will return your compliment robin i am this moment returned from the chase and shall have no objection to a draught of your family liquor   robin how kind your honor is  to edward one may know his honor to be a gentleman born by his not having a morsel of pride  i remember hearing his honor bear a bob once in the very ballad we were going to sing   sir h you shall hear me again robin  i wish you to call at the hall about two oclock edward as i have
