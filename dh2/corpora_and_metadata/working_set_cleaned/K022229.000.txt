warmest heart his soul with every nobler noblest passion fraught and pushing carrying friendship sometimes to a fault in arts or arms in battle or debate he guarded graced and dignified the state deserved the laurel and the bay that crown the distant blended honors of the sword and gown his countrys bulwark her delight and pride in war he conquered and in peace he died his memory shall to

the task decline  the virtues of humanity are thine but though from friendships source the passions rise which melt that flood the soul and swell into the eyes the effect will differ though the source the same my tear paid gratitude but thine gives fame  my tear is gratitude but thine is fame farewell illustrious shade for ever rest distinguished in the mansions of the blessed thence let thy bright examples brilliant ray to wisdom point and light us on our way  from thence while darkling we thy star survey thy bright example marks and lights the way it is well  the throbbing of the heart subsides the blood begins to flow in sprightlier tides by from thee my friend the soul with joy surveys the page of memory marked with brighter days by from thee  thy mien thy manners and thy smile recall the generous graceful brave argyll by thee thus owned a client of thy race where could i with such dignity or grace  thus owned by thee thus client of thy race where could i else with dignity or grace from every prejudice and passion free lay bare the minds recesses as but to thee often as from the pomp thy state requires to contemplations cell thy friend retires fast by the banks of thames his active mind dwells on the motley mask he left behind so far the wide society extends so numerous those  kind custom calls our friends we call from custom friends yet numerous as they are so very few wish what they ought or as they ought pursue he scarce can tell what the dark whole drama means or can fix the plan or separate the scenes all would be great but who with care attends whence greatness springs it is progress and it is ends how to direct their wandering footsteps right or place their errors in a stronger light and mark the failings that mislead the throng through life shall be the subject of my song an epistle pollio to thee thy wellconducted youth has formed thy mind to hear and follow truth from thee the crowds that wisdoms laws despise may learn that none are happy but the wise that wisdom blunts the darts misfortune flings and lifts to noblest heights ambitions wings what then is wisdom  it is what gilds success what makes it solid infelt happiness what keeps the enlarged pursuit to virtue true and sinks the selfish in the social view say then bright guide since thy auspicious celestial beam lights us through social happiness to fame say whence the general groan the ensanguind plain the royal butcher purple murderer striding over the slain sweeping half human kind from natures face and forging fetters for the rising race say whence and why whence then and why the venal and the vile the voice of honor but and the heart of guile hardened to crimes and resolute to rise on holy friendships love and friendships violated ties the mad voluptuary the selfish drone that stifles merit ardent struggling to be known from cunning  cunning which that deforms the mind poisons the soil for noblest growths designed blasts heroes laurels withers blights the statesmans bays cunning oerturns the throne she means to raise corrupts the heart contracts the social plan and strangles or smothers narrows to selflove the love of man by that the soul a in prey to mean desires her flight obstructed and impaired her fires panting for glory anxious to be great toils moyls through the paths of baseness and deceit but still though fortune all her aid should lend she finds the means have overturned the end she loathes shrinks at the servile crowd and bribed address and sickens in the bosom of success would thou my friend survey with closer stricter ken these rival rulers of the sons of men well analyze their complicated frame and show their powers their passions and their aim how they dispense to mortals good or ill and how affect the bosom which that they fill wisdoms the health and vigor of the mind it that flows from every talent justly joined from judgment tempring wits excessive blaze and genius brightning what reflection weighs  where judgment tempers wits enlivening blaze and genius quickens what reflection weighs parent of peace and guardian of the brave and teaching how to conquer and to save draws not the sword to fetter but to free and vice alone is slain by her decree  she wars on vice alone and her decree draws not the sword to fetter but to free her arms bid social arts and science rise and conquest scatter victory shed blessings as she flies if to a narrower sphere her cares descend here is is she gives the father citizen and friend the indulgent husband and the endearing wife and all the tender charities of life what rich gifts flow from wisdoms high command  these gifts then flow from wisdoms high command she makes the vanquished bless the victors hand adorns and dignifies to raise to dignify an humble state or fits the robes of greatness to the great she leads where virtue calls and fame attends cunnings the timorous guide to sordid ends composed of parts which wisdom calls defects and she apes her with the talents she rejects hence one proceeds with firmness one with fear there manly caution low suspicion here it is like false coin by cheats invented first the best materials mimickd copied with the worst like that it makes the wealth of knaves alone and brings as sure destruction when it is known as liberal arts and love of virtue fail in courts the cunning over the wise prevail the crowds that vice and vanity pour forth whose claims are founded on their wants not worth ill brook the manly manners of the wise who scorn to flatter what they must despise where solid worth first forms the fair pretense upborne by probity enforced by sense where virtuous toil must earn what cannot be sold and genius pants for glory not for gold where bribry birth cabal neglected wait and wisdoms hand unbars preferments gate this tribe the unhospitable mansions shun and to the allcourting dome of cunning run run to the important shrug the unmeaning hint which that cunning ever coins in falshoods mint to warm professions strangers to the mind to speech the interpreter of truth designed now taught not to discover but disguise while the whole man each look each gesture lies with all the train of ineffectual cant to soothe not satisfy  to lure not grant here the gay scenes with smiles perpetual strike all smooth all flattering and all false alike insidious praise extols while envy burns and feigned attachments meet with feigned returns the garb of worth distressed cloaks squandrings tribes that interest may seem generous when she bribes patron and client turn by turn deceive ask from false motives from false motives give illfounded all pretension promise grant naught real but profusion bribe and want bribry want thus prudence virtue parts crowd wisdoms train thus cunning sweeps the lavish squandrer false and vain just to the tillers care the crop succeeds one binds the sheaf and one collects the weeds by this we see and see without surprise the cunning far divided from the wise  by this we see how far the distance lies how wide that parts the cunning from the wise hear then her voice whose comprehensive call extends to the great vulgar and the small when men unfit for greatness will be great why trust they not why dont they trust to title and estate what demon envious of their peace and fame drives them to make the care of states their aim to quit the shade of private life and stray where every weakness glares in open day whoever in life mistakes his destined place becomes sure the author of his own disgrace for heaven bestows on all sufficient skill to grace the station which they ought to fill and though to all not equally profuse ordained us all for decency and use is wit denied have thou not wit be generous and sincere fails learning too does learning fail let social love appear let truth goodnature virtue be improved and since thou can not be admired be loved had natures bounty partially been shown and barred up every road to fame but one twould seem less strange to see the unequal strife that drives us all to shine in public life less strange that thirst of power over all prevails and calls to vice for aid when genius fails  how thirst of power over all alike prevails and calls in vice to aid where genius fails is private life then void of graceful aims are father husband friend ignoble ungraceful names so far ignoble ungraceful that we rather choose power we want genius to become or use the rule that leads us with unerring pace to tread the various paths of life with grace let genius fire the blood or damps restrain confined to precepts obvious easy plain alike through every rank for practice fit to guard the plain good man and grace the wit through court camp cottage heard felt understood consist in this  be honest just and good this well observed shall shield the weak from blame and lend defects themselves a softer name neglect of this debases all our thoughts and heightens all our failings into faults failings and faults from different springs proceed faults from the heart and failings from the head quick to discern and wisely to pursue and tread lifes labyrinth with judgments clue are parts that few indulged by heaven can fill but all men may be honest  if they will this wisdoms laws which that first taught virtue teach and place esteem and love in all mens reach her guardian influence then to none unkind severely kind which different powers to different parts assigned and through the whole impartial and exact never deals the part without the powers to act gave honesty her general gift and best to guide support and dignify the rest to genius this secures immortal fame and consecrates ambitions boldest aim without it all the sparks of heavenly fire or blaze destructive or in smoke expire given to distress mankind and not to save thus the same sword which that weilded by the brave in virtues cause has saved a sinking land does midnight murder in a ruffians hand if wisdom then to all those powers imparts which lead us on that lead alone to fame through arms or arts and sows with bounty free and unconfined the seeds of honesty in every mind which varied by the soil yet must produce or private peace of mind or public use that use which consecrates the patriots dust that peace of mind which ever crowns the just then boldly let the muse this truth proclaim wisdoms the source and honesty the stream that wafts us safe through danger and distress to public fame or private happiness while cunning weaves a maze without a clue and purblind wavering grasps false greatness for the true see the foul monster of gigantic size on broken faith and injured friendship rise fearful and rash rapacious and profuse in temper rigid and in morals loose by smiling treachry led with downcast eyes and prompted by suspicion whispering lies see ribald mirth and beggry void of shame demure detraction and loudbawling blame these fiends chosn friends by interest ranked in order stand and flattery next with falsehood in her hand riot and guile the wild procession ends and what oppression gains corruption spends descend a moment from this fancied height and view the treacherous scene by wisdoms light this pageant pomp this homage of an hour this painted grandeur this unweildy power shall shrink when truth displays her piercing beam like the vain visions of a fevrish dream which promise health and youth for ever gay but yield us back to death at break of day so soon shall illgot greatness change it is state turned to reproach contempt and public hate proceed and think what balm can cure the breast where guilt has entered once and banished rest if we have friends what friendship can we trust that knows us mean ungenrous and unjust if we have foes how grateful to those foes to see us toil against our own repose such is the fate of greatness built on vice remorse the purchase innocence the price when wisdoms eye surveys the guilty great they move our pity rather than our hate i know they scorn the tricks by which they rise and view their illgot power with joyless eyes they scorn the prince on whom that power depends they scorn their slaves and most they scorn their friends friendship well chose of every blessing chief doubles our pleasures and divides our grief but view their friendships can we call them choice no it is necessity imposed by vice which vile and weak itself must always seek for safety from the wicked and the weak vileness must on the villains aid depend to plan fresh mischiefs and the past defend and weakness trusts the weak through jealous care as impotence with eunuchs guards the fair but let this truth into thy mind descend the man that makes a fool or knave his friend whatever pretense may seem his choice to guide has crimes to perpetrate or crimes to hide true greatness sure unfolds a nobler scene without majestic and within serene on wisdoms height sublime securely placed she plans new glories and enjoys the past and while the blasts of rage and faction blow hears the storm rave and thunder roll below there high enthroned with silent joy surveys whole kingdoms lift their hands in grateful praise and or soaring still though pleased with deathless fame never fails beyond our world to stretch her aim  extends perhaps beyond one world her aim it is here is to plead the suffering orphans cause and dry the tear that stern oppression draws to call each latent seed of virtue forth and wind up kindle modest diffidence to worth if gentle slumber over her eyelids creeps the prayers of nations guard her as she sleeps if cares the fettered sense from sleep unbind those cares ensure the quiet of mankind she knows no guilty pang no secret shame no start of horror from the midnight dream but wrapped in pleasing thought with ravished eyes sees public good on proud oppression rise and watchful over the blessings of her hand wakes like the guardian angel of the land is there a land which that such a guard can claim led by fair virtue to the mount of fame  by virtues tutring hand borne up to fame where sacred liberty each breast inflames and wealth and life itself are second names which that dares when tyrants strike repel the blow and lay the mighty sons of ruin low which that once though safe herself by heavens decree dared fight and conquer to set europe free and starting at her captive neighbors groan stepped forth and made the glorious cause her own is there where learning may securely soar uncurbd by churchmen unconstrained by power where free devotion wears an open face and reason leads her to the throne of grace though various unconfusd to none a slave it is god adoring   sincere though various and to none a slave but god is worshipped by the lights he gave is there a prince intrepid just and wise who views his people with a fathers eyes and pleased to guard that right which nature gave scorns to debase a subject to a slave should his bright influence fill the courtly sphere and courtiers dare be honest and sincere serve though they promised feel though they professed nor check the social virtues of the breast should truth ascend usurp suspicious falshoods seat and honesty grow graceful in the great should wit presume to speak and learning write and power and liberal arts at length unite pronounce that land the favorite land of fate pronounce the prince who that rules it truly great smit with true glorys charms thus far the muse with eager steps the shining track pursues strains every nerve to raise the favorite theme and fix fair glory in the blaze of fame it is here is to praise true greatness on the throne it is thine o george to make that praise thy own finis
