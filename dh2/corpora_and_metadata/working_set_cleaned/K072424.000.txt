notes upon the twelve books of paradise lost  collected from the spectator  written by mr addison  london printed for jacob tonson at shakespeares head over against katharinestreet in the strand mdccxix  notes upon the twelve books of paradise lost spectator no     cedite romani scriptores cedite graii propert there is nothing in nature more irksome than general discourses especially when they turn chiefly upon words for this reason i shall wave the discussion of that point which was started some years since whether miltons paradise lost may be called an heroic poem those who will not give it that title may call it if they please a divine poem it will be sufficient to its perfection if it has in it all the beauties of the highest kind of poetry and as for those who allege it is not an heroic poem they advance no more to the diminution of it than if they should say adam is not aeneas nor eve helen  i shall therefore examine it by the rules of epic poetry and see whether it falls short of the iliad or aeneid in the beauties which are essential to that kind of writing the first thing to be considered in an epic poem is the fable which is perfect or imperfect according as the action which it relates is more or less so this action should have three qualifications in it first it should be but one action secondly it should be an entire action and thirdly it should be a great action to consider the action of the iliad aeneid and paradise lost in these three several lights homer to preserve the unity of his action hastens into the midst of things as horace has observed had he gone up to ledas egg or begun much later even at the rape of helen or the investing of troy it is manifest that the story of the poem would have been a series of several actions he therefore opens his poem with the discord of his princes and artfully interweaves in the several succeeding parts of it an account of every thing material which relates to them and had passed before this fatal dissension after the same manner aeneas makes his first appearance in the tyrrhene seas and within sight of italy because the action proposed to be celebrated was that of his settling himself in latium but because it was necessary for the reader to know what had happened to him in the taking of troy and in the preceding parts of his voyage virgil makes his hero relate it by way of episode in the second and third books of the aeneid the contents of both which books come before those of the first book in the thread of the story though for preserving of this unity of action they follow it in the disposition of the poem milton in imitation of these two great poets opens his paradise lost with an infernal council plotting the fall of man which is the action he proposed to celebrate and as for those great actions the battle of the angels and the creation of the world which preceded in point of time and which in my opinion would have entirely destroyed the unity of his principal action had he related them in the same order that they happened he cast them into the fifth sixth and seventh books by way of episode to this noble poem vid the end of spect       aristotle himself allows that homer has nothing to boast of as to the unity of his fable though at the same time that great critic and philosopher endeavors to palliate this imperfection in the greek poet by imputing it in some measure to the very nature of an epic poem some have been of opinion that the aeneid also labors in this particular and has episodes which may be looked upon as excrescencies rather than as parts of the action on the contrary the poem which we have now under our consideration has no other episodes than such as naturally arise from the subject and yet is filled with such a multitude of astonishing incidents that it gives us at the same time a pleasure of the greatest variety and of the greatest simplicity uniform in its nature though diversified in the execution  i must observe also that as virgil in the poem which was designed to celebrate the original of the roman empire has described the birth of its great rival the carthaginian commonwealth milton with the like art in his poem on the fall of man has related the fall of those angels who are his professed enemies beside the many other beauties in such an episode it is running parallel with the great action of the poem hinders it from breaking the unity so much as another episode would have done that had not so great an affinity with the principal subject in short this is the same kind of beauty which the critics admire in the spanish friar or the double discovery where the two different plots look like counterparts and copies of one another  the second qualification required in the action of an epic poem is that it should be an entire action an action is entire when it is complete in all its parts or as aristotle describes it when it consists of a beginning a middle and an end nothing should go before it be intermixed with it or follow after it that is not related to it as on the contrary no single step should be omitted in that just and regular progress which it must be supposed to take from its original to its consummation thus we see the anger of achilles in its birth its continuance and effects and aeneass settlement in italy carried on through all the oppositions in his way to it both by sea and land the action in milton excells i think both the former in this particular we see it contrived in hell executed upon earth and punished by heaven the parts of it are told in the most distinct manner and grow out of one another in the most natural order  the third qualification of an epic poem is its greatness the anger of achilles was of such consequence that it embroiled the kings of greece destroyed the heroes of asia and engaged all the gods in factions aeneass settlement in italy produced the caesars and gave birth to the roman empire miltons subject was still greater than either of the former it does not determine the fate of single persons or nations but of a whole species the united powers of hell are joined together for the destruction of mankind which they effected in part and would have completed had not omnipotence it self interposed the principal actors are man in his greatest perfection and woman in her highest beauty their enemies are the fallen angels the messiah their friend and the almighty their protector in short every thing that is great in the whole circle of being whether within the verge of nature or out of it has a proper part assigned it in this admirable poem  in poetry as in architecture not only the whole but the principal members and every part of them should be great i will not presume to say that the book of games in the aeueid or that in the iliad are not of this nature nor to reprehend virgils simile of the top and many other of the same kind in the iliad as liable to any censure in this particular but i think we may say without derogating from those wonderful performances that there is an indisputable and unquestioned magnificence in every part of paradise lost and indeed a much greater than could have been formed upon any pagan system  but aristotle by the greatness of the action does not only mean that it should be great in its nature but also in its duration or in other words that it should have a due length in it as well as what we properly call greatness the just measure of this kind of magnitude he explains by the following similitude an animal no bigger than a mite cannot appear perfect to the eye because the sight takes it in at once and has only a confused idea of the whole and not a distinct idea of all its parts if on the contrary you should suppose an animal of ten thousand furlongs in length the eye would be so filled with a single part of it that it could not give the mind an idea of the whole what these animals are to the eye a very short or a very long action would be to the memory the first would be as it were lost and swallowed up by it and the other difficult to be contained in it homer and virgil have shown their principal art in this particular the action of the iliad and that of the aeneid were in themselves exceeding short but are so beautifully extended and diversified by the invention of episodes and the machinery of gods with the like poetical ornaments that they make up an agreeable story sufficient to employ the memory without overcharging it miltons action is enriched with such a variety of circumstances that i have taken as much pleasure in reading the contents of his books as in the best invented story i ever met with it is possible that the traditions on which the iliad and aeneid were built had more circumstances in them than the history of the fall of man as it is related in scripture besides it was easier for homer and virgil to dash the truth with fiction as they were in no danger of offending the religion of their country by it but as for milton he had not only a very few circumstances upon which to raise his poem but was also obliged to proceed with the greatest caution in every thing that he added out of his own invention and indeed notwithstanding all the restraints he was under he has filled his story with so many surprising incidents which bear so close analogy with what is delivered in holy writ that it is capable of pleasing the most delicate reader without giving offense to the most scrupulous  the modern critics have collected from several hints in the iliad and aeneid the space of time which is taken up by the action of each of those poems but as a great part of miltons story was transacted in regions that lie out of the reach of the sun and the sphere of day it is impossible to gratify the reader with such a calculation which indeed would be more curious than instructive none of the critics either ancient or modern having laid down rules to circumscribe the action of an epic poem with any determined number of years days or hours vid spect  0    but of this more particularly hereafter  spectator no      notandi sunt tibi mores hor having examined the action of paradise lost let us in the next place consider the actors this is aristotles method of considering first the fable and secondly the manners or as we generally call them in english the fable and the characters  homer has excelled all the heroic poets that ever wrote in the multitude and variety of his characters every god that is admitted into his poem acts a part which would have been suitable to no other deity his princes are as much distinguished by their manners as by their dominions and even those among them whose characters seem wholly made up of courage differ from one another as to the particular kinds of courage in which they excel in short there is scarce a speech or action in the iliad which the reader may not ascribe to the person that speaks or acts without seeing his name at the head of it  homer does not only outshine all other poets in the variety but also in the novelty of his characters he has introduced among his grecian princes a person who had lived in three ages of men and conversed with theseus hercules polyphenius and the first race of heroes his principal actor is the son of a goddess not to mention the offspring of other deities who have likewise a place in his poem and the venerable trojan prince who was the father of so many kings and heroes there is in these several characters of homer a certain dignity as well as novelty which adapts them in a more peculiar manner to the nature of an heroic poem though at the same time to give them the greater variety he has described a vulcan that is a buffoon among his gods and a thersites among his mortals  virgil falls infinitely short of homer in the characters of his poem both as to their variety and novelty aeneas is indeed a perfect character but as for achates though he is styled the heros friend he does nothing in the whole poem which may deserve that title gyas mnestheus sergestus and cloenthus are all of them men of the same stamp and character  fortemque gyan fortemque cloanthum virg  there are indeed several very natural incidents in the part of ascanius as that of dido cannot be sufficiently admired i do not see any thing new or particular in turnus pallas and evander are remote copies of hector and priam as lausus and mezentius are almost parallels to pallas and evander the characters of nisus and eurialus are beautiful but common we must not forget the parts of sinon camilla and some few others which are fine improvements on the greek poet in short there is neither that variety nor novelty in the persons of the aeneid which we meet with in those of the iliad  if we look into the characters of milton we shall find that he has introduced all the variety his fable was capable of receiving the whole species of mankind was in two persons at the time to which the subject of his poem is confined we have however four distinct characters in these two persons we see man and woman in the highest innocence and perfection and in the most abject state of guilt and infirmity the two last characters are indeed very common and obvious but the two first are not only more magnificent but more new than any characters either in virgil or homer or indeed in the whole circle of nature  milton was so sensible of this defect in the subject of his poem and of the few characters it would afford him that he has brought into it two actors of a shadowy and fictitious nature in the persons of sin and death by which means he has wrought into the body of his fable a very beautiful and wellinvented allegory vid spect     but notwithstanding the fineness of this allegory may atone for it in some measure i cannot think that persons of such a chimerical existence are proper actors in an epic poem because there is not that measure of probability annexed to them which is requisite in writings of this kind as i shall show more at large hereafter  virgil has indeed admitted fame as an actress in the aeneid but the part she acts is very short and none of the most admired circumstances in that divine work we find in mockheroic poems particularly in the dispensary and the lutrin several allegorical persons of this nature which are very beautiful in those compositions and may perhaps be used as an argument that the authors of them were of opinion such characters might have a place in an epic work for my own part i should be glad the reader would think so for the sake of the poem i am now examining and must further add that if such empty unsubstantial beings may be ever made use of on this occasion never were any more nicely imagined and employed in more proper actions than those of which i am now speaking  another principal actor in this poem is the great enemy of mankind the part of ulysses in homers odyssey is very much admired by aristotle as perplexing that fable with very agreeable plots and intricacies not only by the many adventures in his voyage and the subtilty of his behavior but by the various concealments and discoveries of his person in several parts of that poem but the crafty being i have now mentioned makes a much longer voyage than ulysses puts in practice many more wiles and stratagems and hides himself under a greater variety of shapes and appearances all of which are severally detected to the great delight and surptise of the reader  we may likewise observe with how much art the poet has varied several characters of the persons that speak in his infernal assembly on the contrary how has he represented the whole godhead exerting it self toward man in its full benevolence under the threefold distinction of a creator a redeemer and a comforter  nor must we omit the person of raphael who amidst his tenderness and friendship for man shows such a dignity and condescension in all his speech and behavior as are suitable to a superior nature the angels are indeed as much diversified in milton and distinguished by their proper parts as the gods are in homer or virgil the reader will find nothing ascribed to vriel gabriel michael or raphael which is not in a particular manner suitable to their respective characters  there is another circumstance in the principal actors of the iliad and aeneid which give a peculiar beauty to those two poems and was therefore contrived with very great judgment i mean the authors having chosen for their heroes persons who were so nearly related to the people for whom they wrote achilles was a greek and aeneas the remote founder of rome by this means their countrymen whom they principally proposed to themselves for their readers were particularly attentive to all the parts of their story and sympathized with their heroes in all their adventures a roman could not but rejoice in the escapes successes and victories of aeneas and be grieved at any defeats misfortunes or disappointments that befell him as a greek must have had the same regard for achilles and it is plain that each of those poems have lost this great advantage among those readers to whom their heroes are as strangers or indifferent persons  miltons poem is admirable in this respect since it is impossible for any of its readers whatever nation country or people he may belong to not to be related to the persons who are the principal actors in it but what is still infinitely more to its advantage the principal actors in this poem are not only our progenitors but our representatives we have an actual interest in every thing they do and no less than our utmost happiness is concerned and lies at stake in all their behavior  i shall subjoin as a corollary to the foregoing remark an admirable observation out of aristotle which has been very much misrepresented in the quotations of some modern critics if a man of perfect and consummate virtue falls into a misfortune it raises our pity but not our terror because we do not fear that it may be our own case who do not resemble the suffering person but as that great philosopher adds if we see a man of virtue mixed with infirmities fall into any misfortune it does not only raise our pity but our terror because we are afraid that the like misfortunes may happen to our selves who resemble the character of the suffering person  i shall only remark in this place that the foregoing observation of aristotle though it may be true in other occasions does not hold in this because in the present case though the persons who fall into misfortune are of the most perfect and consummate virtue it is not to be considered as what may possibly be but what actually is our own case since we are embarked with them on the same bottom and must be partakers of their happiness or misery  in this and some other very few instances aristotles rules for epic poetry which he had drawn from his reflections upon homer cannot be supposed to square exactly with the heroic poems which have been made since his time since it is evident to every impartial judge his rules would still have been more perfect could he have perused the aeneid which was made some hundred years after his death  in my next i shall go through other parts of miltans poem and hope that what i shall there advance as well as what i have already written will not only serve as a comment upon milton but upon aristotle  spectator no     reddere personae scit convenientia cuique hor we have already taken a general survey of the fable and characters in miltons paradise lost the parts which remain to be considered according to aristotles method are the sentiments and the language before i enter upon the first of these i must advertise my reader that it is my design as soon as i have finished my general reflections on these four several heads to give particular instances out of the poem now before us of beauties and imperfections which may be observed under each of them as also of such other particulars as may not properly fall under any of them this i thought fit to premise that the reader may not judge too hastily of this piece of criticism or look upon it as imperfect before he has seen the whole extent of it  the sentiments in an epic poem are the thoughts and behavior which the author ascribes to the persons whom he introduces and are just when they are conformable to the characters of the several persons the sentiments have likewise a relation to things as well as persons and are then perfect when they are such as are adapted to the subject if in either of these cases the poet endeavors to argue or explain to magnify or diminish to raise love or hatred pity or terror or any other passion we ought to consider whether the sentiments he makes use of are proper for those ends homer is censured by the critics for his defect as to this particular in several parts of the iliad and odyssey though at the same time those who have treated this great poet with candor have attributed this defect to the times in which he lived it was the fault of the age and not of homer if there wants that delicacy in some of his sentiments which now appears in the works of men of a much inferior genius besides if there are blemishes in any particular thoughts there is an infinite beauty in the greatest part of them in short if there are many poets who would not have fallen into the meanness of some of his sentiments there are none who could have risen up to the greatness of others virgil has excelled all others in the propriety of his sentiments milton shines likewise very much in this particular nor must me omit one consideration which adds to his honor and reputation homer and virgil introduced persons whose characters are commonly known among men and such as are to be met with either in history or in ordinary conversation miltons characters most of them lie out of nature and were to be formed purely by his own invention it shows a greater genius in shakespeare to have drawn his calyban than this hotspur or julius caesar the one was to be supplied out of his own imagination whereas the other might have been formed upon tradition history and observation it was much easier therefore for homer to find proper sentiments for an assembly of grecian generals than for milton to diversifie his infernal council with proper characters and inspire them with a variety of sentiments the loves of dido and aeneas are only copies of what has passed between other persons adam and eve before the fall are a different species from that of mankind who are descended from them and none but a poet of the most unbounded invention and the most exqu site judgment could have filled their conversation and behavior with so many apt circumstances during their state of innocence  nor is it sufficient for an epic poem to be filled with such thoughts as are natural unless it abound also with such as are sublime virgil in this particular falls short of homer he has not indeed so many thoughts that are low and vulgar but at the same time has not so many thoughts that are sublime and noble the truth of it is virgil seldom rises into very astonishing sentiments where he is not fired by the iliad he every where charms and pleases us by the force of his own genius but seldom elevates and transports us where he does not fetch his hints from homer  miltons chief talent and indeed his distinguishing excellence lies in the sublimity of his thoughts there are others of the moderns who rival him in every other part of poetry but in the greatness of his sentiments he triumphs over all the poets both modern and ancient homer only excepted it is impossible for the imagination of man to distend it self with greater ideas than those which he has laid together in his first second and sixth books the seventh which describes the creation of the world is likewise wonderfully sublime though not so apt to stir up emotion in the mind of the reader nor consequently so perfect in the epic way of writing because it is filled with less action let the judicious reader compare what longinus has observed on several passages in homer and he will find parallels for most of them in the paradise lost  from what has been said we may infer that as there are two kinds of sentiments the natural and the sublime which are always to be pursued in an heroic poem there are also two kinds of thoughts which are carefully to be avoided the first are such as are affected and unnatural the second such as are mean and vulgar as for the first kind of thoughts we meet with little or nothing that is like them in virgil he has none of those trifling points and puerilities that are so often to be met with in ovid none of the epigrammatick turns of lucan none of those swelling sentiments which are so frequently in statius and claudian none of those mixed embellishments of tasso every thing is just and natural his sentiments show that he had a perfect insight into humane nature and that he knew every thing which was the most proper to affect it  mr dryden has in some places which i may hereafter take notice of misrepresented virgils way of thinking as to this particular in the translation he has given us of the aeneid i do not remember that homer any where falls into the faults abovementioned which were indeed the false refinements of later ages milton it must be confessed has sometimes erred in this respect as i shall show more at large in another paper though considering all the poets of the age in which he writ were infected with this wrong way of thinking he is rather to be admired that he did not give more into it than that he did sometimes comply with the vicious taste which still prevails so much among modern writers  but since several thoughts may be natural which are low and grovelling an epic poet should not only avoid such sentiments as are unnatural or affected but also such as are mean and vulgar homer has opened a great field of raillery to men of more delicacy than greatness of genius by the homeliness of some of his sentiments but as i have before said these are rather to be imputed to the simplicity of the age in which he lived to which i may also add of that which he described than to any imperfection in that divine poet zoilus among the ancients and monsieur perrault among the moderns pushed their ridicule very far upon him on account of some such sentiments there is no blemish to be observed in virgil under this head and but a very few in milton  i shall give but one instance of this impropriety of thought in homer and at the same time compare it with an instance of the same nature both in virgil and milton sentiments which raise laughter can very seldom be admitted with any decency into an heroic poem whose business is to excite passions of a much nobler nature homer however in his characters of vulcan and thersites in his story of mars and venus in his behavior of irus and in other passages has been observed to have lapsed into the burlesque character and to have departed from that serious air which seems essential to the magnificence of an epic poem i remember but one laugh in the whole aeneid which rises in the fifth book upon monoetes where he is represented as thrown overboard and drying himself upon a rock but this piece of mirth is so well timed that the severest critic can have nothing to say against it for it is in the book of games and diversions where the readers mind may be supposed to be sufficiently relaxed for such an entertainment the only piece of pleasantry in paradise lost is where the evil spirits are described as rallying the angels upon the success of their new invented artillery this passage i look upon to be the most exceptionable in the whole poem as being nothing else but a string of puns and those too very indifferent  satan beheld their plight and to his mates thus in derision called o friends why come not on these victors proud ere while they fierce were coming and when we to entertain them fair with open front and breast what could we more propounded terms of composition straight they changed their minds flew off and into strange vagaries fell as they would dance yet for a dance they seemed somewhat extravagant and wild perhaps for joy of offered peace but i suppose if our proposals once again were heard we should compel them to a quick result to whom thus belial in like gamesome mood leader the terms we sent were terms of weight of hard contents and full of force urged home such as we might perceive amused them all and stumbled many who receives them right had need from head to foot well understand not understood this gift they have besides they show us when our foes walk not upright thus they among themselves in pleasant vein stood scoffing    spectator no     ne quicunque deus quicunque adhibebitur heroes regali conspectus in auro nuper et ostro migret in obscuras humili sermon tabernas aut dum vitat humum nubes et inania captet hor having already treated of the fable the characters and sentiments in the paradise lost we are in the last place to consider the language and as the learned world is very much divided upon milton as to this point i hope they will excuse me if i appear particular in any of my opinions and incline to those who judge the most advantagiously of the author  it is requisite that the language of an heroic poem should be both perspicuous and sublime in proportion as either of these two qualities are wanting the language is imperfect perspicuity is the first and most necessary qualification insomuch that a goodnatured reader sometimes overlooks a little slip even in the grammar or syntax where it is impossible for him to mistake the poets sense of this kind is that passage in milton wherein he speaks of satan  god and his son except created thing naught valued he nor shunned and that in which he describes adam and eve adam the goodliest man of men since born his sons the fairest of her daughters eve   it is plain that in the former of these passages according to the natural syntax the divine persons mentioned in the first line are represented as created beings and that in the other adam and eve are confounded with their sons and daughters such little blemishes are these when the thought is great and natural we should with horace impute to a pardonable inadvertency or to the weakness of human nature which cannot attend to each minute particular and give the last finishing to every circumstance in so long a work the ancient critics therefore who were acted by a spirit of candor rather than that of cavilling invented certain figures of speech on purpose to palliate little errors of this nature in the writings of those authors who had so many greater beauties to atone for them  if clearness and perspicuity were only to be consulted the poet would have nothing else to do but to cloth his thoughts in the most plain and natural expressions but since it often happens that the most obvious phrases and those which are used in ordinary conversation become too familiar to the ear and contract a kind of meanness by passing through the mouths of the vulgar a poet should take particular care to guard himself against idiomatick ways of speaking ovid and lucan have many poornesses of expression upon this account as taking up with the first phrases that offered without putting themselves to the trouble of looking after such as would not only be natural but also elevated and sublime milton has but a few failings in this kind of which however you may meet with some instances as in the following passages embrios and idiots eremites and friars white black and gray with all their trumpery here pilgrims roam   a while discourse they hold no fear least dinner cool when thus began our author  who of all ages to succeed but feeling the evil on him brought by me will curse my head ill fare our ancestor impure for this we may thank adam  the great masters in composition know very well that many an elegant phrase becomes improper for a poet or an orator when it has been debased by common use for this reason the works of ancient authors which are written in dead languages have a great advantage over those which are written in languages that are now spoken were there any mean phrases or idioms in virgil and homer they would not shock the ear of the most delicate modern reader so much as they would have done that of an old greek or roman because we never hear them pronounced in our streets or in ordinary conversation  it is not therefore sufficient that the language of an epic poem be perspicuous unless it be also sublime to this end it ought to deviate from the common forms and ordinary phrases of speech the judgment of a poet very much discovers it self in shunning the common roads of expression without falling into such ways of speech as may seem stiff and unnatural he must not swell into a false sublime by endeavoring to avoid the other extreme among the greeks aeschylus and some times sophocles were guilty of this fault among the latins claudian and statius and among our own countrymen shakespeare and lee in these authors the affectation of greatness often hurts the perspicuity of the style as in many others the endeavor after perspicuity prejudices its greatness  aristotle has observed that the idiomatick style may be avoided and the sublime formed by the following methods first by the use of metaphors such are those in milton imparadised in another arms  and in his hand a reed stood waving tipped with fire  the grassie clods now calvd  spangled with eyes    in these and innumerable other instances the metaphors are very bold but just i must however observe that the metaphors are not thick sown in milton which always favors too much of wit that they never clash with one another which as aristotle observes turns a sentence into a kind of an enigma or riddle and that he seldom has recourse to them where the proper and natural words will do as well  another way of raising the language and giving it a poetical turn is to make use of the idioms of other tongues virgil is full of the greek forms of speech which the critics call hellenisms as horace in his odes abounds with them much more than virgil i need not mention the several dialects which homer has made use of for this end milton in conformity with the practice of the ancient poets and with aristotles rule has infused a great many latinisms as well as gracisms and sometimes hebraisms into the language of his poem as toward the beginning of it nor did they not perceive the evil plight in which they were or the fierce pains not feel yet to their genrals voice they soon obeyed  who shall tempt with wandering fees the dark unbottomd infinite abyss and through the palpable obscure find out his uncouth way or spread his airy flight vpborn with indefatigable wings over the vast abrupt  so both ascend in the visions of god  b     under this head may be reckoned the placing the adjective after the substantive the transposition of words the turning the adjective into a substantive with several other foreign modes of speech which this poet has naturalized to give his verse the greater sound and throw it out of prose  the third method mentioned by aristotle is what agrees with the genius of the greek language more than with that of any other tongue and is therefore more used by homer than by any other poet i mean the lengthning of a phrase by the addition of words which may either be inserted or omitted as also by the extending or contracting of particular words by the insertion or omission of certain syllables milton has put in practice this method of raising his language as far as the nature of our tongue will permit as in the passage abovementioned eremite for what is hermit in common discourse if you observe the measure of his verse he has with great judgment suppressed a syllable in several words and shortened those of two syllables into one by which method besides the abovementioned advantage he has given a greater variety to his numbers but this practice is more particularly remarkable in the names of persons and of countries as beelzebub hessebon and in many other particulars wherein he has either changed the name or made use of that which is not the most commonly known that he might the better depart from the language of the vulgar  the same reason recommended to him several old words which also makes his poem appear the more venerable and gives it a greater air of antiquity  i must likewise take notice that there are in milton several words of his own coining as cerberean miscreated helldoomd embryon atoms and many others if the reader is offended at this liberty in our english poet i would recommend him to a discourse in plutarch which shows us how frequently homer has made use of the same liberty  milton by the abovementioned helps and by the choice of the noblest words and phrases which our tongue would afford him has carried our language to a greater height than any of the english poets have ever done before or after him and made the sublimity of his style equal to that of his sentiments  i have been the more particular in these observations on miltons style because it is that part of him in which he appears the most singular the remarks i have here made upon the practice of other poets with my observations out of aristotle will perhaps alleviate the prejudice which some have taken to his poem upon this account though after all i must confess that i think his style though admirable in general is in some places too much stiffened and obscured by the frequent use of those methods which aristotle has prescribed for the raising of it  this redundancy of those several ways of speech which aristotle calls foreign language and with which milton has so very much enriched and in some places darkened the language of his poem was the more proper for his use because his poem is written in blank verse rhyme without any other assistance throws the language off from prose and very often makes an indifferent phrase pass unregarded but where the verse is not built upon rhymes there pomp of sound and energy of expression are indispensably necessary to support the style and keep it from falling into the flatness of prose  those who have not a taste for this elevation of style and are apt to ridicule a poet when he goes out of the common forms of expression would do well to see how aristotle has treated an ancient author called euclid for his insipid mirth upon this occasion mr dryden used to call this sort of men his prosecriticks  i should under this head of the language consider miltons numbers in which he has made use of several elisions that are not customary among other english poets as may be particularly observed in his cutting off the letter y when it precedes a vowel this and some other innovations in the measure of his verse has varied his numbers in such a manner as makes them incapable of satiating the ear and cloying the reader which the same uniform measure would certainly have done and which the perpetual returns of rhyme never fail to do in long narrative poems i shall close these reflections upon the language of paradise lost with observing that milton has copied after homer rather than virgil in the length of his periods the copiousness of his phrases and the running of his verses into one another  spectator no      vbi plura nitent in carmine non ego paucis offender maculis quas aut incuria fudit aut humana parum cavit natura  hor i have now considered miltons paradise lost under those four great heads of the fable the characters the sentiments and the language and have shown that he excels in general under each of these heads i hope that i have made several discoveries which may appear new even to those who are versed in critical learning were i indeed to choose my readers by whose judgment i would stand or fall they should not be such as are acquainted only with the french and italian critics but also with the ancient and modern who have written in either of the learned languages above all i would have them well versed in the greek and latin poets without which a man very often fancies that he understands a critic when in reality he does not comprehend his meaning  it is in criticism as in all other sciences and speculations one who brings with him any implieit notions and observations which he has made in his reading of the poets will find his own reflections methodized and explained and perhaps several little hints that had passed in his mind perfected and improved in the works of a good critic whereas one who has not these previous lights is very often an utter stranger to what he reads and apt to put a wrong interpretation upon it  nor is it sufficient that a man who sets up for a judge in criticism should have perused the authors abovementioned unless he has also a clear and logical head without this talent he is perpetually puzzled and perplexed amidst his own blunders mistakes the sense of those he would confute or if he chances to think right does not know how to convey his thoughts to another with clearness and perspicuity aristotle who was the best critic was also one of the best logicians that ever appeared in the world  mr locks essay on human understanding would be thought a very odd book for a man to make himself master of who would get a reputation by critical writings though at the same time it is very certain that an author who has not learned the art of distinguishing between words and things and of ranging his thoughts and setting them in proper lights whatever notions he may have will lose himself in confusion and obscurity i might further observe that there is not a greek or latin critic who has not shown even in the style of his criticisms that he was a master of all the elegance and delicacy of his native tongue  the truth of it is there is nothing more absurd than for a man to set up for a critic without a good insight into all the parts of learning whereas many of those who have endeavored to signalize themselves by works of this nature among our english writers are not only defective in the abovementioned particulars but plainly discover by the phrases which they make use of and by their confused way of thinking that they are not acquainted with the most common and ordinary systems of arts and sciences a few general rules extracted out of the french authors with a certain cant of words has sometimes set up an illiterate heavy writer for a most judicious and formidable critic  one great mark by which you may discovet a critic who has neither taste nor learning is this that he seldom ventures to praise any passage in an author which has not been before received and applauded by the public and that his criticism turns wholly upon little faults and errors this part of a critic is so very easy to succeed in that we find every ordinary reader upon the publishing of a new poem has wit and ill nature enough to turn several passages of it into ridicule and very often in the right place this mr dryden has very agreeably remarked in those two celebrated lines errors like straws upon the surface flow he who would search for pearls must dive below   a true critic ought to dwell rather upon excellencies than imperfections to discover the concealed beauties of a writer and communicate to the world such things as are worth their observation the most exquisite words and finest strokes of an author are those which very often appear the most doubtful and exceptionable to a man who wants a relish for polite learning and they are these which a sour undistinguishing critic generally attacks with the greatest violence tully observes that it is very easy to brand or fix a mark upon what he calls verbum ardens or as it may be rendered into english a glowing bold expression and to turn it into ridicule by a cold illnatured criticism a little wit is equally capable of exposing a beauty and of aggravating a fault and though such a treatment of an author naturally produces indignation in the mind of an understanding reader it has however its effect among the generality of those whose hands it falls into the rabble of mankind being very apt to think that every thing which is laughed at with any mixture of wit is ridiculous in it self  such a mirth as this is always unseasonable in a critic as it rather prejudices the reader than convinces him and is capable of making a beauty as well as a blemish the subject of derision a man who cannot write with wit on a proper subject is dull and stupid but one who shows it in an improper place is as impertinent and absurd besides a man who has the gift of ridicule is apt to find fault with any thing that gives him an opportunity of exerting his beloved talent and very often censures a passage not because there is any fault in it but because he can be merry upon it such kinds of pleasantry are very unfair and disingenuous in works of criticism in which the greatest masters both ancient and modern have always appeared with a serious and instructive air  as i intend in my next paper to show the defects in miltons paradise lost i thought fit to premise these few particulars to the end that the reader may know i enter upon it as on a very ungrateful work and that i shall just point at the imperfections without endeavoring to inflame them with ridicule i must also observe with longinus that the productions of a great genius with many lapses and inadvertencies are infinitely preferable to the works of an inferior kind of author which are scrupulously exact and conformable to all the rules of correct writing  i shall conclude my paper with a story out of boccalini which sufficiently shows us the opinion that judicious author entertained of the sort of critics i have been here mentioning a famous critic says he having gathered together all the faults of an eminent poet made a present of them to apollo who received them very graciously and resolved to make the author a suitable return for the trouble he had been at in collecting them in order to this he set before him a sack of wheat as it had been just threshed out of the sheaf he then bid him pick out the chaff from among the corn and lay it aside by itself the critic applied himself to the task with great industry and pleasure and after having made the due separation was presented by apollo with the chaff for his pains  spectator no      velut si egregio inspersos reprendas corpore naevos hor after what i have said in my last saturdays paper i shall enter on the subject of this without farther preface and remark the several defects which appear in the fable the characters the sentiments and the language of miltons paradise lost not doubting but the reader will pardon me if i allege at the same time whatever may be said for the extenuation of such defects the first imperfection which i shall observe in the fable is that the event of it is unhappy  the fable of every poem is according to aritatles division either simple or implex it is called simple when there is no change of fortune in it implex when the fortune of the chief actor changes from bad to good or from good to bad the implex fable is thought the most perfect i suppose because it is more proper to stir up the passions of the reader and to surprise him with a greater variety of accidents  the implex fable is therefore of two kinds in the first the chief actor makes his way through a long series of dangers and difficulties till he arrives at honor and prosperity as we see in the story of ulysses in the second the chief actor in the poem falls from some eminent pitch of honor and prosperity into misery and disgrace thus we see adam and eve sinking from a state of innocence and happiness into the most abject condition of sin and sorrow  the most taking tragedies among the ancients were built on this last sort of implex fable particularly the tragedy of oedipus which proceeds upon a story if we may believe aristotle the most proper for tragedy that could be invented by the wit of man i have taken some pains in a former paper to show that this kind of implex fable wherein the event is unhappy is more apt to affect an audience than that of the first kind notwithstanding many excellent pieces among the ancients as well as most of those which have been written of late years in our own country are raised upon contrary plans i must however own that i think this kind of fable which is the most perfect in tragedy is not so proper for an heroic poem  milton seems to have been sensible of this imperfection in his fable and has therefore endeavored to cure it by several expedients particularly by the mortification which the great adversary of mankind meets with upon his return to the assembly of infernal spirits as it is described in a beautiful passage of the tenth book and likewise by the vision wherein adam at the close of the poem sees his offspring triumphing over his great enemy and himself restored to a happier paradise than that from which he fell  there is another objection against miltons fable which is indeed almost the same with the former though placed in a different light namely that the hero in the paradise lost is unsuccessful and by no means a match for his enemies this gave occasion to mr drydens reflection that the devil was in reality miltons hero i think i have obviated this objection in my first paper the paradise lost is an epic or a narrative poem and he that looks for an hero in it searches for that which milton never intended but if he will needs fix the name of an hero upon any person in it it is certainly the messiah who is the hero both in the principal action and in the chief episodes paganism could not furnish out a real action for a fable greater than that of the iliad or aeneid and therefore an heathen could not form a higher notion of a poem than one of that kind which they call an heroic whether miltons is not of a sublimer nature i will not presume to determine it is sufficient that i show there is in the paradise lost all the greatness of plan regularity of design and masterly beauties which we discover in homer and virgil  i must in the next place observe that milton has interwoven in the texture of his fable some particulars which do not seem to have probability enough for an epic poem particularly in the actions which he ascribes to sin and death and the picture which he draws of the limbo of vanity with other passages in the second book such allegories rather savor of the spirit of spenser and ariosto than of homer and virgil  in the structure of his poem he has likewise admitted of too many digressions it is finely observed by aristotle that the author of an heroic poem should seldom speak himself but throw as much of his work as he can into the mouths of those who are his principal actors aristotle has given no reason for this precept but i presume it is because the mind of the reader is more awed and elevated when he hears aeneas or achilles speak than when virgil or homer talk in their own persons besides that assuming the character of an eminent man is apt to fire the imagination and raise the ideas of the author tully tells us mentioning his dialogue of old age in which cato is the chief speaker that upon a review of it he was agreeably imposed upon and fancied that it was cato and not he himself who uttered his thoughts on that subject  if the reader would be at the pains to see how the story of the iliad and aeneid is delivered by those persons who act in it he will be surprised to find how little in either of these poems proceeds from the authors milton has in the general disposition of his fable very finely observed this great rule insomuch that there is scarce a third part of it which comes from the poet the rest is spoken either by adam and eve or by some good or evil spirit who is engaged either in their destruction or defense  from what has been here observed it appears that digressions are by no means to be allowed of in an epic poem if the poet even in the ordinary course of his narration should speak as little as possible he should certainly never let his narration sleep for the sake of any reflections of his own i have often observed with a secret admiration that the longest reflection in the aeneid is in that passage of the tenth book where turnus is represented as dressing himself in the spoils of pallas whom he had slain virgil here lets his fable stand still for the sake of the following remark how is the mind of man ignorant of futurity and unable to bear prosperous fortune with moderation the time will come when turnus shall wish that he had left the body of pallas untouched and curse the day on which he dressed himself in these spoils as the great event of the aeneid and the death of turnus whom aeneas slew because he saw him adorned with the spoils of pallas turns upon this incident virgil went out of his way to make this reflection upon it without which so small a circumstance might possibly have slipped out of his readers memory lucan who was an injudicious poet lets drop his story very frequently for the sake of his unnecessary digressions or his diverticula as scaliger calls them if he gives us an account of the prodigies which preceded the civil war he declaims upon the occasion and shows how much happier it would be for man if he did not feel his evil fortune before it comes to pass and suffer not only by its real weight but by the apprehension of it miltons complaint for his blindness his panegyric on marriage his reflections on adam and eves going naked of the angels eating and several other passages in his poem are liable to the same exception though i must confess there is so great a beauty in these very digressions that i would not with them our of his poem  i have in a former paper spoken of the characters of miltons paradise lost and declared my opinion as to the allegorical persons who are introduced in it  if we look into the sentiments i think they are sometimes defective under the following heads first as there are several of them too much pointed and some that degenerate even into punns of this last kind i am afraid is that in the first book where speaking of the pigmies he calls them  the small infantry warred on by cranes    another blemish that appears in some of his thoughts is his frequent allusion to heathen fables which are not certainly of a piece with the divine subject of which he treats i do not find fault with these allusions where the poet himself represents them as fabulous as he does in some places but where he mentions them as truths and matters of fact the limits of my paper will not give me leave to be particular in instances of this kind the reader will easily remark them in his perusal of the poem  a third fault in his sentiments is an unnecessary ostentation of learning which likewise occurs very frequently it is certain that both homer and virgil were masters of all the learning of their times but it shows itself in their works after an indirect and concealed manner milton seems ambitions of letting us know by his excursions on free will and predestination and his many glances upon history astronomy geography and the like as well as by the terms and phrases he sometimes makes use of that he was acquainted with the whole circle of arts and sciences  if in the last place we consider the language of this great poet we must allow what i have hinted in a former paper that it is often too much labored and sometimes obscured by old words transpositions and foreign idioms senecas objection to the style of a great author rigot ojus oration nihil in ea placidum nihil lene is what many critics make to milton as i cannot wholly refute it so i have already apologized for it in another paper to which i may further add that miltons sentiments and ideas were so wonderfully sublime that it would have been impossible for him to have represented them in their full strength and beauty without having recourse to these foreign assistances our language sunk under him and was unequal to that greatness of soul which furnished him with such glorious conceptions  a second fault in his language is that he often affects a kind of jingle in his words as in the following passages and many others and brought into the world a world of woe  begirt the almighty throne beseeching or besieging  this tempted our attempt  at one slight bound high overleapt all bound   i know there are figures for this kind of speech that some of the greatest ancients have been guilty of it and that aristotle himself has given it a place in his rhetoric among the beauties of that art but as it is in itself poor and trifling it is i think at present universally exploded by all the masters of polite writing  the last fault which i shall take notice of in miltons style is the frequent use of what the learned call technical words or terms of art it is one of the great beauties of poetry to make hard things intelligible and to deliver what is abstruse of it self in such easy language as may be understood by ordinary readers besides that the knowledge of a poet should rather seem born with him or inspired than drawn from books and systems i have often wondered how mr dryden could translate a passage out of virgil after the following manner tack to the larboard and stand off to sea veer starboard sea and land  milton makes use of larboard in the same manner when he is upon building he mentions doric pillars pilasters cornice freeze architrave when he talks of heavenly bodies you meet with ecliptic and eccentric the trepidation stars dropping from the zenith rays culminating from the equator to which might be added many instances of the like kind in several other arts and sciences  ishall in my next papers give an account of the many particular beauties in milton which would have been too long to insert under those general heads i have already treated of and with which i intend to conclude this piece of criticism  spectator no  0   volet haec sub luce videri judicis argutum quae non formidat acumen hor i have seen in the works of a modern philosopher a map of the spots in the sun my last paper of the faults and blemishes in miltons paradise lost may be considered as a piece of the same nature to pursue the allusion as it is observed that among the bright parts of the luminous body abovementioned there are some which glow more intensely and dart a stronger light than others so notwithstanding i have already shown miltons poem to be very beautiful in general i shall now proceed to take notice of such beauties as appear to me more exquisite than the rest milton has proposed the subject of his poem in the following verses of mans first disobedience and the fruit of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste brought death into the world and all our woe with loss of eden till one greater man restore us and regain the blissful seat sing heavenly muse    these lines are perhaps as plain simple and unadorned as any of the whole poem in which particular the author has conformed himself to the example of homer and the precept of horace  his invocation to a work which turns in a great measure upon the creation of the world is very properly made to the muse who inspired moses in those books from whence our author drew his subject and to the holy spirit who is therein represented as operating after a particular manner in the first production of nature this whole exordium rises very happily into noble language and sentiment as i think the transition to the fable is exquisitely beautiful and natural  the ninedays astonishment in which the angels lay entranced after their dreadful overthrow and fall from heaven before they could recover either the use of thought or speech is a noble circumstance and very finely imagined vid hesiod the division of hell into seas of fire and into firm ground impregnated with the same furious element with that particular circumstance of the exclusion of hope from those infernal regions are instances of the same great and fruitful invention  the thoughts in the first speech and description of satan who is one of the principal actors in this poem are wonderfully proper to give us a full idea of him his pride envy and revenge obstinacy despair and impenitence are all of them very artfully interwoven in short his first speech is a complication of all those passions which discover themselves separately in several other of his speeches in the poem the whole part of this great enemy of mankind is filled with such incidents as are very apt to raise and terrify the readers imagination of this nature in the book now before us is his being the first that awakens out of the general trance with his posture on the burning lake his rising from it and the description of his shield and spear thus satan talking to his nearest mate with head uplife above the wave and eyes that sparkling blazed his other parts beside prone on the flood extended long and large lay floating many a rood  forthwith upright he rears from off the pool his mighty stature on each hand the flames driven backward slope their pointing spires and rolled in billows leave in the midst a horrid vale then with expanded wings he steers his flight alost incumbent on the dusky air that felt unusual weight   his pondrous shield ethereal temper massy large and round behind him cast the broad circumference hung on his shoulders like the moon whose orb through optic glass tho tuscan artists view at evening from the top of fesole or in valdatno to desory new lands rivers or mountains on her spotty globe his spear to equal which the tallest pine hewn on norwegian hills to be the mast of some great ammiral were but a wand he walked with to support uneasy steps over the burning marl    to which we may add his call to the fallen angels that lay plunged and stupefied in the sea of fire he called so loud that all the hollow deep of hell resounded    but there is no single passage in the whole poem worked up to a greater sublimity than that wherein his person is described in those celebrated lines  he above the rest in shape and gesture proudly eminent stood like a tower etc   his sentiments are every way answerable to his character and suitable to a created being of the most exalted and most depraved nature such is that in which he takes possession of his place of torments  hail horrors hail infernal world and thou profoundest hill receive thy new possessor one who brings a mind not to be changed by place or time and afterward  here at leest we shall be free the almighty has not built here for his envy will not drive us hence here we may reign secure and in my choice to reign is worth ambition though in hell better to reign in hell than serve in heaven   amidst those impieties which this enraged spirit utters in other places of the poem the author has taken care to introduce none that is not big with absurdity and incapable of shocking a religious reader his words as the poet describes them bearing only a semblance of worth not substance he is likewise with great art described as owning his adversary to be almighty whatever perverse interpetation he puts on the justice mercy and other attributes of the supreme being he frequently confesses his omnipotence that being the perfection he was forced to allow him and the only consideration which could support his pride under the shame of his defeat  nor must i here omit that beautiful circumstance of his bursting out in tears upon his survey of those innumerable spirits whom he had involved in the same guilt and ruin with himself  he now prepared to speak whereat their doubled ranks they bend from wing to wing and half enclose him round with all his peers attention held them mute thrice he assayed and thrice in spite of scorn tears such as angels weep burst forth    the catalogue of evil spirits has abundance of learning in it and a very agreeable turn of poetry which rises in a great measure from its describing the places where they were worshipped by those beautiful marks of rivers so frequent among the ancient poets the author had doubtless in this place homers catalogue of ships and virgils lift of warriors in his view the characters of moloch and belial prepare the readers mind for their respective speeches and behavior in the second and sixth book the account of thammuz is finely romantic and suitable to what we read among the ancients of the worship which was paid to that idol  thammuz came next behind whose annual wound in lebanon allured the syrian damsels to lament his fate in amorous ditties all a summers day while smooth adonis from his native rock ran purple to the sea supposed with blood of thammuz yearly wounded the lovetale infected sions daughters with like heat whose wanton passions in the sacred porch ezekiel saw when by the vision led his eye surveyed the dark idolatries of alienated judah    the reader will pardon me if i insert as a note on this beautiful passage the account given us by the late ingenious mr maundrell of this ancient piece of worship and probably the first occasion of such a superstition we came to a fair large river  doubtless the ancient river adonis so famous for the idolatrous rites performed here in lamentation of adonis we had the fortune to see what may be supposed to be the occasion of that opinion which lucian relates concerning this river viz that this stream at certain seasons of the year especially about the feast of adonis is of a bloody color which the heathens looked upon as proceeding from a kind of sympathy in the river for the death of adonis who was killed by a wild boar in the mountains out of which this stream rises something like this we saw actually come to pass for the water was stained to a surprising redness and as we observed in traveling had discolored the sea a great way into a reddish hue occasioned doubtless by a sort of minium or red earth washed into the river by the violence of the rain and not by any stain from adoniss blood  the passage in the catalogue explaining the manner how spirits transform themselves by contraction or enlargement of their dimensions is introduced with great judgment to make way for several surprising accidents in the sequel of the poem there follows one at the very end of the first book which is what the french critics call mavelous but at the same time probable by reason of the passage last mentioned as soon as the infernal palace is finished we are told the multitude and rabble of spirits immediately shrunk themselves into a small compass that there might be room for such a numberless assembly in this capacious hall but it is the poets refinement upon this thought which i most admire and which is indeed very noble in its self for he tells us that notwithstanding the vulgar among the fallen spirits contracted their forms those of the first rank and dignity still preserved their natural dimensions thus incorporeal spirits to smallest forms reduced their shapes immense and were at large though without number still amidst the hall of that infernal court but far within and in their own dimensions like themselves the great seraphick lords and cherubim in close recess and secret conclave sat a thousand demygods on golden seats frequent and full    the character of mammon and the description of the pandamonium are full of beauties  there are several other strokes in the first book wonderfully poetical and instances of that sublime genius so peculiar to the author such is the description of azazels stature and of the infernal standard which he unfurls as also of that ghastly light by which the fiends appear to one another in their place of torments the seat of dosolation void of light save what the glimmering of those livid flames casts pale and dreadful    the shout of the whole host of fallen angels when drawn up in battle array  the universal host up sent a shout that tore hells concave and beyond frighted the reign of chaos and old night   the review which the leader makes of his infernal army  he through the armed files darts his experienced eye and soon traverse the whole battalion views their order due their visages and stature as of gods their number last he sums and now his heart distends with pride and hardning in his strength glories    the flash of light which appeared upon the drawing of their swords he spoke and to confirm his words outflew millions of flaming swords drawn from the thighs of mighty cherubim the sudden blaze far round illumined hell    the sudden production of the pandaemoniune anon out of the earth a fabric huge rose like an exhalation with the sound of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet   the artificial illuminations made in it  from the arched roof pendent by subtle magic many a row of starry lamps and blazing crescets fed with naphtha and asphaltus yielded light as from a sky    there are also several noble similies and allusions in the first book of paradise lost and here i must observe that when milton alludes either to things or persons he never quits his simile till it rises to some very great idea which is often foreign to the occasion that gave birth to it the resemblance does not perhaps last above a line or two but the poet runs on with the hint till he has raised out of it some glorious image or sentiment proper to inflame the mind of the reader and to give it that sublime kind of entertainment which is suitable to the nature of an heroic poem those who are acquainted with homers and virgils way of writing cannot but be pleased with this kind of structure in miltons similitudes i am the more particular on this head because ignorant readers who have formed their taste upon the quaint similies and little turns of wit which are so much in vogue among modern poets cannot relish these beauties which are of a much higher nature and are therefore apt to censure miltons comparisons in which they do not see any surprising points of likeness monsieur perrault was a man of this vitiated relish and for that very reason has endeavored to turn into ridicule several of homers similitudes which he calls comparaisons a longue queue longtaild comparisons i shall conclude this paper on the first book of milton with the answer which monsieur boileau makes to perrault on this occasion comparisons says he in odes and epic poems are not introduced only to illustrate and embellish the discourse but to amuse and relax the mind of the reader by frequently disengaging him from too painful an attention to the principal subject and by leading him into other agreeable images homer says he excelled in this particular whose comparisons abound with such images of nature as are proper to relieve and diversifie his subjects he continually instructs the reader and makes him take notice even in objects which are every day before our eyes of such circumstances as we should not otherwise have observed to this he adds as a maxim universally acknowledged that it is not necessary in poetry for the points of the comparison to correspond with one another exactly but that a general resemblance is sufficient and that too much nicety in this particular savours of the rhetorician and epigrammatist  in short if we look into the conduct of homer virgil and milton as the great fable is the soul of each poem so to give their works an agreeable variety their episodes are so many short fables and their similes so many short episodes to which you may add if you please that their metaphors are so many short similes if the reader considers the comparisons in the first book of milton of the sun in an eclipse of the fleeping leviathan of the bees swarming about their hive of the fairy dance in the view wherein i have here placed them he will easily discover the great beauties that are in each of those passages  spectator no  0  di quibus imperium est animarum umbraeque silentes et chaos et phlegethon loca nocte silentia late sit mihi fas audite loqui fit numine vestro pandere res alta terra et caligine mersas virg i have before observed in general that the persons whom milton introduces into his poem always discover such sentiments and behavior as are in a peculiar manner conformable to their respective characters every circumstance in their speeches and actions is with great justness and delicacy adapted to the persons who speak and act as the poet very much excels in this consistency of his characters i shall beg leave to consider several passages of the second book in this light that superior greatness and mockmajesty which is ascribed to the prince of the fallen angels is admirably preserved in the beginning of this book his opening and closing the debate his taking on himself that great enterprise at the thought of which the whole infernal assembly trembled his encountering the hideous phantom who guarded the gates of hell and appeared to him in all his terrors are instances of that proud and daring mind which could not brook submission even to omnipotence satan was now at hand and from his seat the monster moving onward came as fast with horrid strides hell trembled as he strode the undaunted fiend what this might be admired admired not feared    the same boldness and intrepidity of behavior discovers it self in the several adventures which he meets with during his passage through the regions of unformed matter and particularly in his address to those tremendous powers who are described as presiding over it  the part of moloch is likewise in all its circumstances full of that fire and fury which distinguish this spirit from the rest of the fallen angels he is described in the first book as besmeared with the blood of humane sacrifices and delighted with the tears of parents and the cries of children in the second book he is marked out as the fiercest spirit that fought in heaven and if we consider the figure which he makes in the sixth book where the battle of the angels is described we find it every way answerable to the same furious enraged character  where the might of gabriel fought and with fierce ensigns pierced the deep array of molec furious king who him defied and at his chariot wheels to drag him bound threatened nor from the holy one of heaven refrained his tongue blasphemous but anon down cloven to the waste with shattered arms and uncouth pain fled bellowing    it may be worth while to observe that milton has represented this violent impetuous spirit who is hurried on by such precipitate passions as the first that rises in that assembly to give his opinion upon their present posture of affairs accordingly he declares himself abruptly for war and appears incensed at his companions for losing so much time as even to deliberate upon it all his sentiments are rash audacious and desperate such is that of arming themselves with their tortures and turning their punishments upon him who inflicted them  no let us rather choose armed with hellflames and fury all at once over heavens high towers to force resistless way turning our tortures into horrid arms against the tortrer when to meet the noise of his almighty engine he shall hear infernal thunder and for lightning see black fire and horror shot with equal rage among his angels and his throne it self mixed with tartarean sulphur and strange fire his own invented torments    his preferring annihilation to shame or misery is also highly suitable to his character as the comfort he draws from their disturbing the peace of heaven that if it be not victory it is revenge is a sentiment truly diabolical and becoming the bitterness of this implacable spirit  belial is described in the first book as the idol of the lewd and luxurious he is in the second book pursuant to that description characterised as timorous and slothful and if we look into the sixth book we find him celebrated in the battle of angels for nothing but that scoffing speech which he makes to satan on their supposed advantage over the enemy as his appearance is uniform and of a piece in these three several views we find his sentiments in the infernal assembly every way conformable to his character such are his apprehensions of a second battle his horrors of annihilation his preferring to be miserable rather than not to be i need not observe that the contrast of thought in this speech and that which precedes it gives an agreeable variety to the debate  mammons character is so fully drawn in the first book that the poet adds nothing to it in the second we were before told that he was the first who taught mankind to ransack the earth for gold and silver and that he was the architect of pandaemonium or the infernal palace where the evil spirits were to meet in council his speech in this book is every where suitable to so depraved a character how proper is that reflection of their being unable to taste the happiness of heaven were they actually there in the mouth of one who while he was in heaven is said to have had his mind dazzled with the outward pomps and glories of the place and to have been more intent on the riches of the pavement than on the beatifick vision i shall also leave the reader to judge how agreeable the following sentiments are to the same character  this deep world of darkness do we dread how often amidst thick cloud and dark does heavens allruling size choose to reside his glory unobscured and with the majesty of darkness round covers his throne from whence deep thunders rear mustring their rage and heaven resembles hell as he our darkness cannot we his light imitate when we please this desert soil wants not her hidden luster gems and gold nor want we skill or art from whence to raise magnificence and what can heaven show more   beelzebvb who is reckoned the second in dignity that fell and is in the first book the second that awakens out of the trance and confers with satan upon the situation of their affairs maintains his rank in the book now before us there is a wonderful majesty described in his rising up to speak he acts as a kind of moderator between the two opposite parties and proposes a third undertaking which the whole assembly gives into the motion he makes of detaching one of their body in search of a new world is grounded upon a project devised by satan and cursorily proposed by him in the following lines of the first book space may produce new worlds whereof so rise there went a fame in heaven that he ever long intended to create and therein plant a generation whom his choice regard should favor equal to the sons of heaven thither if but to pry shall be perhaps our first eruption thither or elsewhere for this infernal pit shall never hold celestial spirits in bondage nor the abyss long under darkness cover but these thoughts full counsel must mature    it is on this project that beelzebub grounds his proposal  what if we find some easier enterprise there is a place if ancient and prophetic fame in heaven err not another world the happy seat of some new race called man about this time to be created like to us though less in power and excellence but favored more of him who rules above so was his will pronounced among the gods and by an oath that shook heavens whole circumference confirmed   the reader may observe how just it was not to omit in the first book the project upon which the whole poem turns as also that the prince of the fallen angels was the only proper person to give it birth and that he next to him in dignity was the fittest to second and support it  there is besides i think something wonderfully beautiful and very apt to affect the readers imagination in this ancient prophecy or report in heaven concerning the creation of man nothing could show more the dignity of the species than this tradition which ran of them before their existence they are represented to have been the talk of heaven before they were created virgil in compliment to the roman commonwealth makes the heroes of it appear in their state of preexistence but milton does a far greater honor to mankind in general as he gives us a glimpse of them even before they are in being  the rising of this great assembly is described in a very sublime and poetical manner their rising all at once was as the sound of thunder heard remote    the diversions of the fallen angels with the particular account of their place of habitation are described with great pregnancy of thought and copiousness of invention the diversions are every way suitable to beings who had nothing left them but strength and knowledge misapplied such are their contentions at the race and in feats of arms with their entertainment in the following lines others with vast typhaean rage more fell rend up both rocks and hills and ride the air in whirlwind hell scarce holds the wild uproar   their music is employed in celebrating their own criminal exploits and their discourse in sounding the unfathomable depths of fate free will and foreknowledge  the several circumstances in the description of hell are finely imagined as the four rivers which disgorge themselves into the sea of fire the extremes of cold and heat and the river of oblivion the monstrous animals produced in that infernal world are represented by a single line which gives us a more horrid idea of them than a much longer description would have done  nature breeds perverse all monstrous all prodigious things abominable inutterable and worse than fables yet have feigned or fear conceived gorgons and hydras and chimeras dire   this episode of the fallen spirits and their place of habitation comes in very happily to unbend the mind of the reader from its attention to the debate an ordinary poet would indeed have spun out so many circumstances to a great length and by that means have weakened instead of illustrated the principal fable  the flight of satan to the gates of hell is finely imaged  i have already declared my opinion of the allegory concerning sin and death which is however a very finished piece in its kind when it is not considered as a part of an epic poem the genealogy of the several persons is contrived with great delicacy sin is the daughter of satan and death the offspring of sin the incestuous mixture between sin and death produces those monsters and hellhounds which from time to time enter into their mother and tear the bowels of her who gave them birth these are the terrors of an evil conscience and the proper fruits of sin which naturally rise from the apprehensions of death this last beautiful moral is i think clearly intimated in the speech of sin where complaining of this her dreadful issue she adds before mine eyes in opposition sits grim death thy son and foe who sets them on and me his parent would full soon devour for want of other prey but that he knows his end with mine involved    i need not mention to the reader the beautiful circumstance in the last part of this quotation he will likewise observe how naturally the three persons concerned in this allegory are tempted by one common interest to enter into a confederacy together and how properly sin is made the portress of hell and the only being that can open the gates to that world of tortures  the descriptive part of this allegory is likewise very strong and full of sublime ideas the figure of death the regal crown upon his head his menace of satan his advancing to the combat the outcry at his birth are circumstances too noble to be past over in silence and extremely suitable to this king of terrors i need not mention the justness of thought which is observed in the generation of these several symbolical persons that sin was produced upon the first revolt of satan that death appeared soon after he was cast into hell and that the terrors of conscience were conceived at the gate of this place of torments the description of the gates is very poetical as the opening of them is full of miltons spirit  on a sudden open fly with impetuous recoil and jarring sound the infernal doors and on their hinges grate harsh thunder that the lowest bottom shook of erebus she opened but to shut excelled her power the gates wide open stood that with extended wings a bannerd host under spread ensigns marching might pass through with horse and chariots ranked in loose array so wide they stood and like a furnace mouth cast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame   in satans voyage through the chaos there are several imaginary persons described as residing in that immense waste of matter this may perhaps be conformable to the taste of those critics who are pleased with nothing in a poet which has not life and manners ascribed to it but for my own part i am pleased most with those passages in this description which carry in them a greater measure of probability and are such as might possibly have happened of this kind is his first mounting in the smoke that rises from the infernal pit his falling into a cloud of nitre and the like combustible materials that by their explosion still hurried him forward in his voyage his springing upward like a pyramid of fire with his laborious passage through that confusion of elements which the poet calls the womb of nature and perhaps her grave   the glimmering light which shot into the chaos from the utmost verge of the creation with the distant discovery of the earth that hung close by the moon are wonderfully beautiful and poetical  spectator no     nec dcus intersit nisi dignus vindice nodus inciderit  hor horace advises a poet to consider thoroughly the nature and force of his genius milton seems to have known perfectly well wherein his strength lay and has therefore chosen a subject entirely conformable to those talents of which he was master as his genius was wonderfully turned to the sublime his subject is the noblest that could have entered into the thoughts of man every thing that is truly great and astonishing has a place in it the whole systeme of the intellectual world the chaos and the creation heaven earth and hell enter into the constitution of his poem  having in the first and second book represented the infernal world with all its horrors the thread of his fable naturally leads him into the opposite regions of bliss and glory  if miltons majesty forsakes him any where it is in those parts of his poem where the divine persons are introduced as speakers one may i think observe that the author proceeds with a kind of fear and trembling whilst he describes the sentiments of the almighty he dares not give his imagination its full play but chooses to confine himself to such thoughts as are drawn from the books of the most orthodox divines and to such expressions as may be met with in scripture the beauties therefore which we are to look for in these speeches are not of a poetical nature nor so proper to fill the mind with sentiments of grandeur as with thoughts of devotion the passions which they are designed to raise are a divine love and religious fear the particular beauty of the speeches in the third book consists in that shortness and perspicuity of style in which the poet has couched the greatest mysteries of christianity and drawn together in a regular scheme the whole dispensation of providence with respect to man he has represented all the abstruse doctrines of predestination free will and grace as also the great points of incarnation and redemption which naturally grow up in a poem that treats of the fall of man with great energy of expression and in a clearer and stronger light than i ever met with in any other writer as these points are dry in themselves to the generality of readers the concise and clear manner in which he has treated them is very much to be admired as is likewise that particular art which he has made use of in the interspersing of all those graces of poetry which the subject was capable of receiving  the survey of the whole creation and of every thing that is transacted in it is a prospect worthy of omniscience and as much above that in which virgil has drawn his jupiter as the christian idea of the supreme being is more rational and sublime than that of the heathens the particular objects on which he is described to have cast his eye are represented in the most beautiful and lively manner now had the almighty father from above from the pure empyrean where he sits high throned above all height bent down his eye his own works and their works at once to view about him all the sanctities of heaven stood thick as stars and from his sight received beatitude past utterance on his right the radiant image of his glory sat his only son on earth he first beheld our two first parents yet the only two of mankind in the happy garden placed reaping immortal fruits of joy and love uninterrupted joy unrivaled love in blisful solitude he then surveyed hell and the gulf between and satan there coasting the wall of heaven on this side night in the dun air sublime and ready now to stoop with wearied wings and willing feet on the bare outside of this world that seemed firm land imbosomd without firmament uncertain which in ocean or in air him god beholding from his prospect high wherein past present future he beholds thus to his only son foreseeing spoke   satans approach to the confines of the creation is finely imaged in the beginning of the speech which immediately follows the effects of this speech in the blessed spirits and in the divine person to whom it was addressed cannot but fill the mind of the reader with a secret pleasure and complacency thus while god spoke ambrosial fragrance filled all heaven and in the blessed spirits elect sense of new joy ineffable diffused beyond compare the son of god was seen most glorious in him all his father shone substantially expressed and in his face divine compassion visibly appeared love without end and without measure grace   i need not point out the beauty of that circumstance wherein the whole host of angels are represented as standing mute nor show how proper the occasion was to produce such a silence in heaven the close of this divine colloquy with the hymn of angels that follows upon it are so wonderfully beautiful and poetical that i should not forbear inserting the whole passage if the bounds of my paper would give me leave no sooner had the almighty ceased but all the multitudes of angels with a shout loud as from numbers without number sweet as from blessed voices uttring joy heaven rung with jubilee and loud hosannas filled the eternal regions etc etc    satans walk upon the outside of the universe which at a distance appeared to him of a globular form but upon his nearer approach looked like an unbounded plain is natural and noble as his roaming upon the frontiers of the creation between that mass of matter which was wrought into a world and that shapeless unformed heap of materials which still lay in chaos and confusion strikes the imagination with something astonishingly great and wild i have before spoken of the limbo of vanity which the poet places upon this outermost surface of the universe and shall here explain my self more at large on that and other parts of the poem which are of the same shadowy nature  aristotle observes that the fable of an epic poem should abound in circumstances that are both credible and astonishing or as the french critics choose to phrase it the fable should be filled with the probable and the mavelous this rule is as fine and just as any in aristoles whole art of poetry  if the fable is only probable it differs nothing from a true history if it is only mavelous it is no better than a romance the great secret therefore of heroic poetry is to relate such circumstances as may produce in the reader at the same time both belief and astonishment this is brought to pass in a well chosen fable by the account of such things as have really happened or at least of such things as have happened according to the received opinions of mankind miltons fable is a masterpiece of this nature as the war in heaven the condition of the fallen angels the state of innocence the temptation of the serpent and the fall of man though they are very astonishing in themselves are not only credible but actual points of faith  the next method of reconciling miracles with credibility is by a happy invention of the poet as in particular when he introduces agents of a superior nature who are capable of effecting what is wonderful and what is not to be met with in the ordinary course of things vlyssess ship being turned into a rock and aeneass fleet into a shoal of water nymphs though they are very surprising accidents are nevertheless probable when we are told that they were the gods who thus transformed them it is this kind of machinery which fills the poems both of homer and virgil with such circumstances as are wonderful but not impossible and so frequently produce in the reader the most pleasing passion that can rise in the mind of man which is admiration if there be any instance in the aeneid liable to exception upon this account it is in the beginning of the third book where aeneas is represented as tearing up the myrtle that dropped blood to qualify this wonderful circumstance polydorus tells a story from the root of the myrtle that the barbarous inhabitants of the country having pierced him with spears and arrows the wood which was left in his body took root in his wounds and gave birth to that bleeding tree this circumstance seems to have the mavelous without the probable because it is represented as proceeding from natural causes without the interposition of any god or rather supernatural power capable of producing it the spears and arrows grow of themselves without so much as the modern help of an enchantment if we look into the fiction of miltons fable though we find it full of surprising incidents they are generally suited to our notions of the things and persons described and tempered with a due measure of probability i must only make an exception to the limbo of vanity with his episode of sin and death and some of the imaginary persons in his chaos these passages are astonishing but not credible the reader cannot so far impose upon himself as to see a possibility in them they are the description of dreams and shadows not of things or persons i know that many critics look upon the stories of circe polyphemt the sirens nay the whole odissey and iliad to be allegories but allowing this to be true they are fables which considering the opinions of mankind that prevailed in the age of the poets might possibly have been according to the letter the persons are such as might have acted what is ascribed to them as the circumstances in which they are represented might possibly have been truths and realities this appearance of probability is so absolutely requisite in the greater kinds of poetry that aristotle observes the ancient tragic writers made use of the names of such great men as had actually lived in the world though the tragedy proceeded upon adventures they were never engaged in on purpose to make the subject more credible in a word besides the hidden meaning of an epic allegory the plain literal sense ought to appear probable the story should be such as an ordinary reader may acquiesce in whatever natural moral or political truth may be discovered in it by men of greater penetration  satan after having long wandered upon the surface or outmost wall of the universe discovers at last a wide gap in it which led into the creation and is described as the opening through which the angels pass to and fro into the lower world upon their errands to mankind his sitting upon the brink of this passage and taking a survey of the whole face of nature that appeared to him new and fresh in all its beauties with the simile illustrating this circumstance fills the mind of the reader with as surprising and glorious an idea as any that arises in the whole poem he looks down into that vast hollow of the universe with the eye or as milton calls it in his first book with the kenn of an angel he surveys all the wonders in this immense amphitheatre that lie between both the poles of heaven and takes in at one view the whole round of the creation  his flight between the several worlds that shined on every side of him with the particular description of the sun are set forth in all the wantonness of a luxuriant imagination his shape speech and behavior upon his transforming himself into an angel of light are touched with exquisite beauty the poets thought of directing satan to the sun which in the vulgar opinion of mankind is the most conspicuous part of the creation and the placing in it an angel is a circumstance very finely contrived and the more adjusted to a poetical probability as it was a received doctrine among the most famous philosophers that every orb had its intelligence and as an apostle in sacred writ is said to have seen such an angel in the sun in the answer which this angel returns to the disguised evil spirit there is such a becoming majesty as is altogether suitable to a superior being the part of it in which he represents himself as present at the creation is very noble in it self and not only proper where it is introduced but requisite to prepare the reader for what follows in the seventh book i saw when at his word the formless mass this worlds material mould came to a heap confusion heard his voice and wild uproar stood ruled stood vast infinitude confined till at his second bidding darkness fled light shon etc   in the following part of the speech he points out the earth with such circumstances that the reader can scarce forbear fancying himself employed on the same distant view of it look downward on the globe whose hither side with light from hence though but reflected shines that place is earth the seat of man that light his day etc   i must not conclude my reflections upon this third book of paradise lost without taking notice of that celebrated complaint of milton with which it opens and which certainly deserves all the praises that have been given it though as i have before hinted it may rather be looked upon as an excrescence than as an essential part of the poem the same observation might be applied to that beautiful digression upon hypocrisy in the same book  spectator no     nec satis est pulchra esse poemata dulcia sunto hor those who know how many volumes have been written on the poems of homer and virgil will easily pardon the length of my discourse upon milton the paradise lost is looked upon by the best judges as the greatest production or at least the noblest work of genius in our language and therefore deserves to be set before an english reader in its full beauty for this reason though i have endeavored to give a general idea of its graces and imperfections in my six first papers i thought my self obliged to bestow one upon every book in particular the three first books i have already dispatched and am now entering upon the fourth i need not acquaint my reader that there are multitudes of beauties in this great author especially in the descriptive parts of his poem which i have not touched upon it being my intention to point out those only which appear to me the most exquisite or those which are not so obvious to ordinary readers every one that has read the critics who have written upon the odissy the iliad and the aeneid knows very well that though they agree in their opinions of the great beauties in those poems they have nevertheless each of them discovered several masterstrokes which have escaped the observation of the rest in the same manner i question not but any writer who shall treat on this subject after me may find several beauties in milton which i have not taken notice of i must likewise observe that as the greatest masters of critical learning differ among one another as to some particular points in an epic poem i have not bound my self scrupulously to the rules which any one of them has laid down upon that art but have taken the liberty sometimes to join with one and sometimes with another and sometimes to differ from all of them when i have thought that the reason of the thing was on my side  we may consider the beauties of the fourth book under three heads in the first are those pictures of stilllife which we meet with in the descriptions of eden paradise adams bower etc in the next are the machines which comprehend the speeches and behavior of the good and bad angels in the last is the conduct of adam and eve who are the principal actors in the poem  in the description of paradise the poet has observed aristotles rule of lavishing all the ornaments of diction on the weak unactive parts of the fable which are not supported by the beauty of sentiments and characters accordingly the reader may observe that the expressions are more florid and elaborate in these descriptions than in most other parts of the poem i must further add that though the drawings of gardens rivers rainbows and the like dead pieces of nature are justly censured in an heroic poem when they run out into an unnecessary length the description of paradise would have been faulty had not the poet been very particular in it not only as it is the scene of the principal action but as it is requisite to give us an idea of that happiness from which our first parents fell the plan of it is wonderfully beautiful and formed upon the short sketch which we have of it in holy writ miltons exuberance of imagination has poured forth such a redundancy of ornaments on this seat of happiness and innocence that it would be endless to point out each particular  i must not quit this head without further observing that there is scarce a speech of adam or eve in the whole poem wherein the sentiments and allusions are not taken from this their delightful habitation the reader during their whole course of action always finds himself in the walks of paradise in short as the critics have remarked that in those poems wherein shepherds are actors the thoughts ought always to take a tincture from the woods fields and rivers so we may observe that our first parents seldom lose sight of their happy station in any thing they speak or do and if the reader will give me leave to use the expression that their thoughts are always paradisiacal  we are in the next place to consider the machines of the fourth book satan being now within prospect of eden and looking round upon the glories of the creation is filled with sentiments different from those which he discovered whilst he was in hell the place inspires him with thoughts more adapted to it he reflects upon the happy condition from whence he fell and breaks forth into a speech that is softened with several transient touches of remorse and selfaccusation but at length he confirms himself in impenitence and in his design of drawing men into his own state of guilt and misery this conflict of passions is raised with a great deal of art as the opening of his speech to the sun is very bold and noble o thou that with surpassing glory crowned look from thy sole dominion like the god of this new world at whose sight all the stars hide their diminished heads to thee i call but with no friendly voice and add thy name o sun to tell thee how i hate thy beams that bring to my remembrance from what state i fell how glorious once above thy sphere   this speech is i think the finest that is ascribed to satan in the whole poem the evil spirit afterward proceeds to make his discoveries concerning our first parents and to learn after what manner they may be best attacked his bounding over the walls of paradise his sitting in the shape of a cormorant upon the tree of life which stood in the center of it and overtopped all the other trees of the garden his alighting among the herd of animals which are so beautifully represented as playing about adam and eve together with his transforming himself into different shapes in order to hear their conversation are circumstances that give an agreeable surprise to the reader and are devised with great art to connect that series of adventures in which the poet has engaged this great artificer of fraud  the thought of saians transformation into a cormorant and placing himself on the tree of life seems raised upon that passage in the ilaid where two deities are described as perching on the top of an oak in the shape of vulturs  his planting himself at the ear of eve under the form of a toad in order to produce vain dreams and imaginations is a circumstance of the same nature as his starting up in his own form is wonderfully fine both in the literal description and in the moral which is concealed under it his answer upon his being discovered and demanded to give an account of himself is conformable to the pride and intrepidity of his character know ye not then said satan filled with scorn know ye not me ye knew me once ne mate for you there sitting where you durst not soar not to know me argues yourselves unknown the lowest of your throng    zephons rebuke with the influence it had on satan is exquisitely graceful and moral satan is afterward led away to gabriel the chief of the guardian angels who kept watch in paradise his disdainful behavior on this occasion is so remarkable a beauty that the most ordinary reader cannot but take notice of it gabriels discovering his approach at a distance is drawn with great strength and liveliness of imagination o friends i hear the tread of nimble feet hastening this way and now by glimps discern ithuriel and zephon through the shade and with them comes a third of regal port but faded splendour wan who by his gait and fierce demeanor seems the prince of hell not likely to part hence without contest stand firm for in his look defiance lours   the conference between gabriel and satan abounds with sentiments proper for the occasion and suitable to the persons of the two speakers satans clothing himself with terror when he prepares for the combat is truly sublime and at least equal to homers description of discord celebrated by longinus or to that of fame in virgil who are both represented with their feet standing upon the earth and their heads reaching above the clouds while thus he spoke the angelic squadron bright turned fiery red sharpning in mooned horns their phalanx and began to hem him round with ported spears etc  on the other side satan alarmed collecting all his might dilated stood like teneriff or atlas unremovd his stature reached the sky and on his crest sat horror plumed    i must here take notice that milton is every where full of hints and sometimes literal translations taken from the greatest of the greek and latin poets but this i may reserve for a discourse by it self because i would not break the thread of these speculations that are designed for english readers with such reflections as would be of no use but to the learned  i must however observe in this place that the breaking off the combat between gabriel and satan by the hanging out of the golden scales in heaven is a refinement upon homers thought who tells us that before the battle between hector and achilles jupiter weighed the event of it in a pair of scales the reader may see the whole passage in the   d iliad  virgil before the last decisive combat describes jupiter in the same manner as weighing the fates of turnus and aeneas milton though he fetched this beautiful circumstance from the iliad and aeneid does not only insert it as a poetical embellishment like the authors abovementioned but makes an artful use of it for the proper carrying on of his fable and for the breaking off the combat between the two warriors who were upon the point of engaging to this we may further add that milton is the more justified in this passage as we find the same noble allegory in holy writ where a wicked prince some few hours before he was assaulted and slain is said to have been weighed in the scales and to have been found wanting  i must here take notice under the head of the machines that vriels gliding down to the earth upon a sunbeam with the poets device to make him descend as well in his return to the sun as in his coming from it is a prettiness that might have been admired in a little fanciful poet but seems below the genius of milton the description of the host of armed angels walking their nightly round in paradise is of another spirit so saying on he led his radiant files dazzling the moon as that account of the hymns which our first parents used to hear them sing in these their midnightwalks is altogether divine and inexpressibly amusing to the imagination  we are in the last place to consider the parts which adam and eve act in the fourth book the description of them as they first appeared to satan is exquisitely drawn and sufficient to make the fallen angel gaze upon them with all that astonishment and those emotions of envy in which he is represented two of far nobler shape erect and tall godlike erect with native honor clad in naked majesty seemed lords of all and worthy seemed for in their looks divine the image of their glorious maker shon truth wisdom sanctitude severe and pure severe but in true filial freedom placed for contemplation he and valor formed for softness she and sweet attractive grace he for god only she for god in him his fair large front and eye sublime declared absolute rule and hyacinthin locks round from his parted forelock manly hung clustring but not beneath his shoulders broad she as a vail down to her slender waste her unadorned golden tresses wore dissheveld but in wanton ringlets waved so passed they naked on nor shunned the sight of god or angel for they thought no ill so hand in hand they passed the loveliest pair that ever since in loves embraces met   there is a fine spirit of poetry in the lines which follow wherein they are described as sitting on a bed of flowers by the side of a fountain amidst a mixed assembly of animals  the speeches of these two first lovers flow equally from passion and sincerity the professions they make to one another are full of warmth but at the same time founded on truth in a word they are the gallantries of paradise  when adam first of men  sole partner and sole part of all these joys dearer thy self than all  but let us ever praise him and extol his bounty following our delightful task to prune those growing plants and tend these flowers which were it toilsome yet with thee were sweet to whom thus eve replied o thou for whom and from whom i was formed flesh of thy flesh and without whom am to no end my guide and head what thou have said is just and right for we to him indeed all praises owe and daily thanks i chiefly who enjoy so far the happier lot enjoying thee praeeminent by so much odds while thou like consort to thy self can no where find etc   the remaining part of eves speech in which she gives an account of her self upon her first creation and the manner in which she was brought to adam is i think as beautiful a passage as any in milton or perhaps in any other poet whatsoever these passages are all worked off with so much art that they are capable of pleasing the most delicate reader without offending the most severe that day i often remember when from sleep etc   a poet of less judgment and invention than this great author would have found it very difficult to have filled these tender parts of the poem with sentiments proper for a state of innocence to have described the warmth of love and the professions of it without artifice or hyperbole to have made the man speak the most endearing things without descending from his natural dignity and the woman receiving them without departing from the modesty of her character in a word to adjust the prerogatives of wisdom and beauty and make each appear to the other in its proper force and loveliness this mutual subordination of the two sexes is wonderfully kept up in the whole poem as particularly in the speech of eve i have beforementioned and upon the conclusion of it in the following lines so spoke our general mother and with eyes of conjugal attraction unreprovd and meek surrender half embracing leaned on our first father half her swelling breast naked met his under the flowing gold of her loose tresses hid he in delight both of her beauty and submissive charms smiled with superior love    the poet adds that the devil turned away with envy at the sight of so much happiness  we have another view of our first parents in their evening discourses which is full of pleasing images and sentiments suitable to their condition and characters the speech of eve in particular is dressed up in such a soft and natural turn of words and sentiments as cannot be sufficiently admired  i shall close my reflections upon this book with observing the masterly transition which the poet makes to their evening worship in the following lines thus at their shadie lodge arrived both stood both turned and under open sky adored the god that made both sky air earth and heaven which they beheld the moons resplendent globe and starry pole thou also made the night maker omnipotent and thou the day etc   most of the modern heroic poets have imitated the ancients in beginning a speech without premising that the person said thus or thus but as it is easy to imitate the ancients in the omission of two or three words it requires judgment to do it in such a manner as they shall not be missed and that the speech may begin naturally without them there is a fine instance of this kind out of homer in the twenty third chapter of longinus  spectator no      major rerum mihi nascitur ordo virg we were told in the foregoing book how the evil spirit practiced upon eve as she lay asleep in order to inspire her with thoughts of vanity pride and ambition the author who shows a wonderful art throughout his whole poem in preparing the reader for the several occurrences that arise in it founds upon the above mentioned circumstance the first part of the fifth book adam upon his awaking finds eve still asleep with an unusual discomposure in her looks the posture in which he regards her is described with a tenderness not to be expressed as the whisper with which he awakens her is the softest that ever was conveyed to a lovers ear his wonder was to find unwakend eve with tresses discomposed and glowing cheek as through unquiet rest he on his side leaning halfraisd with looks of cordial love hung over her enamored and beheld beauty which whether waking or asleep shot forth peculiar graces then with voice mild as when zephyrus on flora breathes her hand soft touching whispered thus awake my fairest my espoused my latest found heavens last best gift my ever new delight awake the morning shines and the fresh field calls us we lose the prime to mark how spring our tended plants how blows the citron grove what drops the myrrh and what the balmie reed how nature paints her colors how the be sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet such whispering waked her but with startled eye on adam whom embracing thus she spoke o sole in whom my thoughts find all repose my glory my perfection glad i see thy face and morn returned    i cannot but take notice that milton in the conferences between adam and eve had his eye very frequently upon the book of canticles in which there is a noble spirit of eastern poetry and very often not unlike what we meet with in homer who is generally placed near the age of solomon i think there is no question but the poet in the preceding speech remembered those two passages which are spoken on the like occasion and filled with the same pleasing images of nature my beloved spoke and said unto me rise up my love my fair one and come away for lo the winter is past the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the earth the time of the singing of birds is come and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land the fig tree puts forth her green figs and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell arise my love my fair one and come away come my beloved let us go forth into the field let us get up early to the vineyards let us see if the vine flourish whether the tender grape appear and the pomegranates bud forth  his preferring the garden of eden to that  where the sapient king held dalliance with his fair egyptian spouse shows that the poet had this delightful scene in his mind  eves dream is full of those high conceits engendring pride which we are told the devil endeavored to instill into her of this kind is that part of it where she fancies herself awakened by adam in the following beautiful lines why sleepst thou eve now is the pleasant time the cool the silent save where silence yields to the nightwarbling bird that now awake tunes sweetest his lovelabourd song now reigns full orbd the moon and with more pleasing light shadowy sets off the face of things in vain if none regard heaven wakes with all his eyes whom to behold but thee natures desire in whose sight all things joy with ravishment attracted by thy beauty still to gaze   an injudicious poet would have made adam talk through the whole work in such sentiments as these but flattery and falsehood are not the courtship of miltons adam and could not be heard by eve in her state of innocence excepting only in a dream produced on purpose to taint her imagination other vain sentiments of the same kind in this relation of her dream will be obvious to every reader though the catastrophe of the poem is finely presaged on this occasion the particulars of it are so artfully shadowed that they do not anticipate the story which follows in the ninth book i shall only add that though the vision it self is founded upon truth the circumstances of it are full of that wildness and inconsistency which are natural to a dream adam conformable to his superior character for wisdom instructs and comforts eve upon this occasion so cheered he his fair spouse and she was cheered but silently a gentle tear let fall from either eye and wiped them with her hair two other precious drops that ready stood each in their crystal sluice he ecr they fell kissed as the gracious signs of sweet remorse and pious awe that feared to have offended   the morning hymn is written in imitation of one of those psalms where in the overflowings of gratitude and praise the psalmist calls not only upon the angels but upon the most conspicuous parts of the inanimate creation to join with him in extolling their common maker invocations of this nature fill the mind with glorious ideas of gods works and awaken that divine euthusiasm which is so natural to devotion but if this calling upon the dead parts of nature is at all times a proper kind of worship it was in a particular manner suitable to our first parents who had the creation fresh upon their minds and had not seen the various dispensations of providence nor consequently could be acquainted with those many topics of praise which might afford matter to the devotions of their posterity i need not remark the beautiful spirit of poetry which runs through this whole hymn nor the holiness of that resolution with which it concludes  having already mentioned those speeches which are assigned to the persons in this poem i proceed to the description which the poet gives of raphael his departure from before the throne and his flight through the choirs of angels is finely imaged as milton every where fills his poem with circumstances that are mavelous and astonishing he describes the gate of heaven as framed after such a manner that it opened of it self upon the approach of the angel who was to pass through it  till at the gate of heaven arrived the gate selfopend wide on golden hinges turning as by work divine the sovereign architect had framed   the poet here seems to have regarded two or three passages in the   th iliad as that in particular where speaking of vulcan homer says that he had made twenty tripodes running on golden wheels which upon occasion might go of themselves to the assembly of the gods and when there was no more use for them return again after the same manner scaliger has rallied homer very severely upon this point as m dacier has endeavored to defend it i will not pretend to determine whether in this particular of homer the mavelous does not lose sight of the probable as the miraculous workmanship of miltons gates is not so extraordinary as this of the tripodes so i am persuaded he would not have mentioned it had not he been supported in it by a passage in the scripture which speaks of wheels in heaven that had life in them and moved of themselves or stood still in conformity with the cherubims whom they accompanied  there is no question but milton had this circumstance in his thoughts because in the following book he describes the chariot of the messiah with living wheels according to the plan in ezekiels vision  forth rushed with whirlwind sound the chariot of paternal deity flashing thick flames wheel within wheel undrawn it self instinct with spirit    i question not but bossu and the two daciers who are for vindicating every thing that is censured in homer by something parallel in holy writ would have been very well pleased had they thought of confronting vulcans tripodes with ezekiels wheels  raphaels descent to the earth with the figure of his person is represented in very lively colors several of the french italian and english poets have given a loose to their imaginations in the description of angels but i do not remember to have met with any so finely drawn and so conformable to the notions which are given of them in scripture as this in milton after having set him forth in all his heavenly plumage and represented him as alighting upon the earth the poet concludes his description with a circumstance which is altogether new and imagined with the greatest strength of fancy  like maias son he stood and shook his plumes that heavenly fragrance filled the circuit wide    raphaels reception by the guardian angels his passing through the wilderness of sweets his distant appearance to adam have all the graces that poetry is capable of bestowing the author afterward gives us a particular description of eve in her domestic employments so saying with dispatchful looks in haste she turns on hospitable thoughts intent what choice to choose for delicacy best what order so contrived as not to mix tastes not well joined inelegant but bring taste after taste upheld with kindliest change bestirs her then etc    though in this and other parts of the same book the subject is only the housewifry of our first parent it is set off with so many pleasing images and strong expressions as make it none of the least agreeable parts in this divine work  the natural majesty of adam and at the same time his submissive behavior to the superior being who had vouchsafed to be his guest the solemn hail which the angel bestows upon the mother of mankind with the figure of eve ministering at the table are circumstances which deserve to be admired  raphaels behavior is every way suitable to the dignity of his nature and to that character of a sociable spirit with which the author has so judiciously introduced him he had received instructions to converse with adam as one friend converses with another and to warn him of the enemy who was contriving his destruction accordingly he is represented as sitting down at a table with adam and eating of the fruits of paradise the occasion naturally leads him to his discourse on the food of angels after having thus entered into conversation with man upon more indifferent subjects he warns him of this obedience and makes a natural transition to the history of that fallen angel who was employed in the circumvention of our first parents  hadi followed monsieur bossus method in my first paper on milton i should have dated the action of paradise lost from the beginning of raphaels speech in this book as he supposes the action of the aeneid to begin in the second book of that poem i could allege many reasons for my drawing the action of the aeneid rather from its immediate beginning in the first book than from its remote beginning in the second and show why i have considered the sacking of troy as an episode according to the common acceptance of that word but as this would be a dry unentertaining piece of criticism and perhaps unnecessary to those who have read my first paper i shall not enlarge upon it whichever of the notions be true the unity of miltons action is preserved according to either of them whether we consider the fall of man in its immediate beginning as proceeding from the resolutions taken in the infernal council or in its more remote beginning as proceeding from the first revolt of the angels in heaven the occasion which milton assigns for this revolt as it is founded on hints in holy writ and on the opinion of some great writers so it was the most proper that the poet could have made use of  the revolt in heaven is described with great force of indignation and a fine variety of circumstances the learned reader cannot but be pleased with the poets imitation of homer in the last of the following lines at length into the limits of the north they came and satan took his royal seat high on a hill far blazing as a mount raised on a mount with pyramids and towers from diamond quarries hewn and rocks of gold the palace of great lucifer so call that structure in the dialect of men interpreted    homer mentions persons and things which he tells us in the language of the gods are called by different names from those they go by in the language of men milton has imitated him with his usual judgment in this particular place wherein he has likewise the authority of scripture to justify him the part of abdiel who was the only spirit that in this infinite host of angels preserved his allegiance to his maker exhibits to us a noble moral of religious singularity the zeal of the seraph breaks forth in a becoming warmth of sentiments and expressions as the character which is given us of him denotes that generous scorn and intrepidity which attends heroic virtue the author doubtless designed it as a pattern to those who live among mankind in their present state of degeneracy and corruption so spoke the seraph abdiel faithful found among the faithless faithful only he among innumerable false unmoved unshaken unseducd unterrifyd his loyalty he kept his love his zeal nor number nor example with him wrought to swerve from truth or change his constant mind though single from amidst them forth he passed long way through hostile scorn which he sustained superior nor of violence feared ought and with retorted scorn his back he turned on those proud towers to swift destruction doomed   spectator no      vocat in certamina divos virg we are now entering upon the sixth book of paradise lost in which the poet describes the battle of angels having raised his readers expectation and prepared him for it by several passages in the preceding books i omitted quoting these passages in my observations on the former books having purposely reserved them for the opening of this the subject of which gave occasion to them the authors imagination was so inflamed with this great scene of action that wherever he speaks of it he rises if possible above himself thus where he mentions satan in the beginning of his poem  him the almighty power hurtd headlong flaming from the etherial sky with hideous ruin and combustion down to bottomless perdition there to dwell in adamantine chains and penal fire who durst defy the omnipotent to arms   we have likewise several noble hints of it in the infernal conference o prince o chief of many throned powers that led the embatteld seraphim to war too well i see and rue the dire event that with sad overthrow and foul defect has lost us heaven and all this mighty host in horrible destruction laid thus low but see the angry victor has recalled his ministers of vengeance and pursuit back to the gates of heaven the sulphurous hail shot after us in storm oerblown has laid the fiery surge that from the precipice of heaven received us falling and the thunder winged with red lightning and impetuous rage perhaps has spent his shafts and ceases now to bellow through the vast and boundless deep   there are several other very sublime images on the same subject in the first book as also in the second what when we fled amain pursued and struck with heavens afflicting thunder and besought the deep to shelter us this hell then seemed a refuge from those wounds    in short the poet never mentions any thing of this battle but in such images of greatness and terror as are suitable to the subject among several others i cannot forbear quoting that passage where the power who is described as presiding over the chaos speaks in the third book thus satan and him thus the anarch old with faultring speech and visage incomposd answered i know thee stranger who thou art that mighty leading angel who of late made head against heavens king though overthrown i saw and hoard for such a numerous host fled not in silence through the frighted deep with ruin upon ruin rout on rout confusion worse confounded and heavens gates poured out by millions her victorious bands pursuing    it required great pregnacy of invention and strength of imagination to fill this battle with such circumstances as should raise and astonish the mind of the reader and at the same time an exactness of judgment to avoid every thing that might appear light or trivial those who look into homer are surpised to find his battles still rising one above another and improving in horror to the conclusion of the iliad miltons fight of angels is wrought up with the same beauty it is ushered in with such signs of wrath as are suitable to omnipotence incensed the first engagement is carried on under a cope of fire occasioned by the flights of innumerable burning darts and arrows which are discharged from either host the second onset is still more terrible as it is filled with those artificial thunders which seem to make the victory doubtful and produce a kind of consternation even in the good angels this is followed by the tearing up of mountains and promontories till in the last place messiah comes forth in the fullness of majesty and terror the pomp of his appearance amidst the roarings of his thunders the flashes of his lightnings and the noise of his chariotwheels is described with the utmost flights of humane imagination  there is nothing in the first and last days engagement which does not appear natural and agreeable enough to the ideas most readers would conceive of a fight between two armies of angels  the second days engagement is apt to startle an imagination which has not been raised and qualified for such a description by the reading of the ancient poets and of homer in particular it was certainly a very bold thought in our author to ascribe the first use of artillery to the rebel angels but as such a pernicious invention may be well supposed to have proceeded from such authors so it entered very properly into the thoughts of that being who is all along described as aspiring to the majesty of his maker such engines were the only instruments he could have made use of to imitate those thunders that in all poetry both sacred and profane are represented as the arms of the almighty the tearing up the hills was not altogether so daring a thought as the former we are in some measure prepared for such an incident by the description of the giants war which we meet with among the ancient poets what still made this circumstance the more proper for the poets use is the opinion of many learned men that the fable of the giants war which makes so great a noise in antiquity and gave birth to the sublimest description in hesiods works was an allegory founded upon this very tradition of a fight between the good and bad angels  it may perhaps be worth while to consider with what judgment milton in this narration has avoided every thing that is mean and trivial in the descriptions of the latin and greek poets and at the same time improved every great hint which he met with in their works upon this subject homer in that passage which longinus has celebrated for its sublimeness and which virgil and ovid have copied after him tells us that the giants threw ossa upon olympus and pelion upon ossa he adds an epithet to pelion  which very much swells the idea by bringing up to the readers imagination all the woods that grew upon it there is further a great beauty in his singling out by name these three remarkable mountains so well known to the greeks this last is such a beauty as the scene of miltons war could not possibly furnish him with cloudian in his fragment upon the giants war has given full scope to that wildness of imagination which was natural to him he tells us that the giants tore up whole islands by the roots and threw them at the gods he describes one of them in particular taking up lemnos in his arms and whirling it to the skies with all vulcans shop in the midst of it another tears up mount ida with the river enipeus which ran down the sides of it but the poet not content to describe him with this mountain upon his shoulders tells us that the river flowed down his back as he held it up in that posture it is visible to every judicious reader that such ideas favor more of burlesque than of the sublime they proceed from a wantonness of imagination and rather divert the mind than astonish it milton has taken every thing that is sublime in these several passages and composes out of them the following great image from their foundations loosning to and fro they plucked the seated hills with all their load rocks waters woods and by the shaggy tops vplifting bore them in their hands    we have the full majesty of homer in this short description improved by the imagination of claudian without its puerilities  i need not point out the description of the fallen angels seeing the promontories hanging over their heads in such a dreadful manner with the other numberless beauties in this book which are so conspicuous that they cannot escape the notice of the most ordinary reader  there are indeed so many wonderful strokes of poetry in this book and such a variety of sublime ideas that it would have been impossible to have given them a place within the bounds of this paper besides that i find it in a great measure done to my hand at the end of my lord roscommons essay on translated poetry i shall refer my reader thither for some of the masterstrokes in the sixth book of paradise lost though at the same time there are many others which that noble author has not taken notice of  milton notwithstanding the sublimegenius he was master of has in this book drawn to his assistance all the helps he could meet with among the ancient poets the sword of michael which makes so great a havoc among the bad angels was given him we are told out of the armory of god  but the sword of michael from the armory of god was given him tempered so that neither keen nor solid might resist that edge it met the sword of satan with steep force to smite descending and in half cut sheere    this passage is a copy of that in virgil wherein the poet tells us that the sword of aeneas which was given him by a deity broke into pieces the sword of turnus which came from a mortal forge as the moral in this place is divine so by the way we may observe that the bestowing on a man who is favored by heaven such an allegorical weapon is very conformable to the old eastern way of thinking not only homer has made use of it but we find the jewish hero in the book of maccabees who had fought the battles of the chosen people with so much glory and success receiving in his dream a sword from the hand of the prophet jeremiah the following passage wherein satan is described as wounded by the sword of michael is in imitation of homer the griding sword with discontinuous wound passed through him but the ethereal substance closed not long divisible and from the gash a stream of nectarous humor issuing flowed sanguin such as celestial spirits may bleed and all his armor stained    homer tells us in the same manner that upon diomedes wounding the gods there flowed from the wound an ichor or pure kind of blood which was not bred from mortal viands and that though the pain was exquisitely great the wound soon closed up and healed in those beings who are vested with immortality  i question not but milton in his description of his furious moloc flying from the battle and bellowing with the wound he had received had his eye on mars in the iliad who upon his being wounded is represented as retiring out of the fight and making an outcry louder than that of a whole army when it begins the charge homer adds that the greeks and trojans who were engaged in a general battle were terrified on each side with the bellowing of this wounded deity the reader will easily observe how milton has kept all the horror of this image without running into the ridicule of it  where the might of gabriel fought and with fierce ensigns pierced the deep array of moloc furious king who him defied and at his chariot wheels to drag him bound threatened nor from the holy one of heaven refrained his tongue blasphemous but anon down cloven to the waste with shattered arms and uncouth pain fled bellowing    milton has likewise raised his description in this book with many images taken out of the poetical parts of scripture the messiahs chariot as i have before taken notice is formed upon a vision of ezekiel who as grotius observes has very much in him of homers spirit in the poetical parts of his prophecy  the following lines in that glorious commission which is given the messiah to extirpate the host of rebel angels is drawn from a sublime passage in the psalms go then thou mightiest in thy fathers might ascend my chariot guide the rapid wheels that shake heavens basis bring forth all my war my bow my thunder my almighty arms gird on thy sword on thy puissant thigh   the reader will easily discover many other strokes of the same nature  there is no question but milton had heated his imagination with the fight of the gods in homer before he entered upon this engagement of the angels homer there gives us a scene of men heroes and gods mixed together in battle mars animates the contending armies and lifts up his voice in such a manner that it is heard distinctly amidst all the shouts and confusion of the fight jupiter at the same time thunders over their heads while neptune raises such a tempest that the whole field of battle and all the tops of the mountains shake about them the poet tells us that pluto himself whose habitation was in the very center of the earth was so affrighted at the shock that he leapt from his throne homer afterward describes vulcan as pouring down a storm of fire upon the river xanthus and minerva as throwing a rock at mars who he tells us covered seven acres in his fall  as homer has introduced into his battle of the gods every thing that is great and terrible in nature milton has filled his fight of good and bad angels with all the like circumstances of horror the shout of armies the rattling of brazen chariots the hurling of rocks and mountains the earthquake the fire the thunder are all of them employed to lift up the readers imagination and give him a suitable idea of so great an action with what art has the poet represented the whole body of the earth trembling even before it was created all heaven resounded and had earth been then all earth had to its center shook    in how sublime and just a manner does he afterward describe the whole heaven shaking under the wheels of the messiahs chariot with that exception to the throne of god  under his burning wheels the steadfast empyrean shook throughout all but the throne it self of god    notwithstanding the messiah appears clothed with so much terror and majesty the poet has still found means to make his readers conceive an idea of him beyond what he himself was able to describe yet half his strength he put not forth but checked his thunder in mid volly for he meant not to destroy but root them out of heaven   in a word miltons genius which was so great in it self and so strenghened by all the helps of learning appears in this book every way equal to his subject which was the most sublime that could enter into the thoughts of a poet as he knew all the arts of affecting the mind he knew it was necessary to give it certain restingplaces and opportunities of recovering it self from time to time he has therefore with great address interspersed several speeches reflections similitudes and the like reliefs to diversifie his narration and ease the attention of the reader that he might come fresh to his great action and by such a contrast of ideas have a more lively taste of the nobler parts of his description  spectator no      vt his exordia primis omnia et ipse tener mundi concreverit orbis tum durare solum et discludere nerea ponto coeperit et rerum paullatim sumere formas virg longinvs has observed that there may be a loftiness in sentiments where there is no passion and brings instances out of ancient authors to support this his opinion the pathetick as that great critic observes may animate and inflame the sublime but is not essential to it accordingly as he further remarks we very often find that those who excel most in stirring up the passions very often want the talent of writing in the great and sublime manner and so on the contrary milton has shown himself a master in both these ways of writing the seventh book which we are now entering upon is an instance of that sublime which is not mixed and worked up with passion the author appears in a kind of composed and sedate majesty and though the sentiments do not give so great an emotion as those in the former book they abound with as magnificent ideas the sixth book like a troubled ocean represents greatness in confusion the seventh affects the imagination like the ocean in a calm and fills the mind of the reader without producing in it any thing like tumult or agitation  the critic abovementioned among the rules which he lays down for succeeding in the sublime way of writing proposes to his reader that he should imitate the most celebrated authors who have gone before him and been engaged in works of the same nature as in particular that if he writes on a poetical subject he should consider how homer would have spoken on such an occasion by this means one great genius often catches the flame from another and writes in his spirit without copying servilely after him there are a thousand shining passages in virgil which have been lighted up by homer  milton though his own natural strength of genius was capable of furnishing out a perfect work has doubtless very much raised and ennobled his conceptions by such an imitation as that which longinus has recommended  in this book which gives us an account of the six days works the poet received but very few assistances from heathen writers who were strangers to the wonders of creation but as there are many glorious strokes of poetry upon this subject in holy writ the author has numberless allusions to them through the whole course of this book the great critic i have before mentioned though an heathen has taken notice of the sublime manner in which the lawgiver of the jews has described the creation in the first chapter of genesis and there are many other passages in scripture which rise up to the same majesty where this subject is touched upon milton has shown his judgment very remarkably in making use of such of these as were proper for his poem and in duly qualifying those high strains of eastern poetry which were suited to readers whose imaginations were set to an higher pitch than those of colder climates  adams speech to the angel wherein he desires an account of what had passed within the regions of nature before the creation is very great and solemn the following lines in which he tells him that the day is not too far spent for him to enter upon such a subject are exquisite in their kind and the great light of day yet wants to run much of his race though steep suspense in heaven held by thy voice thy potent voice he hears and longer will delay to hear thee tell his generation etc    the angels encouraging our first parents in a modest pursuit after knowledge with the causes which he assigns for the creation of the world are very just and beautiful the messiah by whom as we are told in scripture the worlds were made comes forth in the power of his father surrounded with an host of angels and clothed with such a majesty as becomes his entering upon a work which according to our conceptions appears the utmost exertion of omnipotence what a beautiful description has our author raised upon that hint in one of the prophets and behold there came four chariots out from between two mountains and the mountains were mountains of brass about his chariot numberless were poured cherub and seraph potentates and thrones and virtues winged spirits and chariots winged from the armoury of god where stand of old myriads between two brazen mountains lodged against a solemn day harnest at hand celestial equipage and now came forth spontaneous for within them spirit lived attendant on their lord heaven opened wide her ever during gates harmonious sound on golden hinges moving    i have before taken notice of these chariots of god and of these gates of heaven and shall here only add that homer gives us the same idea of the latter as opening of themselves though he afterward takes off from it by telling us that the hours first of all removed those prodigious heaps of clouds which lay as a barrier before them  i do not know any thing in the whole poem more sublime than the description which follows where the messiah is represented at the head of his angels as looking down into the chaos calming its confusion riding into the midst of it and drawing the first outline of the creation on heavenly ground they stood and from the shore they viewed the vast immeasurable abyss outrageous as a sea dark wasteful wild up from the bottom turned by furious winds and surging waves as mountains to assault heavens height and with the center mix the pole silence ye troubled waves and thou deep peace said then the omnific word your discord end nor staid but on the wings of cherubim vplifted in paternal glory rode far into chaos and the world unborn for chaos heard his voice him all his train followed in bright procession to behold creation and the wonders of his might then staid the fervid wheels and in his hand he took the golden compasses prepared in gods eternal store to circumscribe this universe and all created things one foot he centered and the other turned round through the vast profundity obscure and said thus far extend thus far thy bounds this be thy just circumference o world   the thought of the golden compasses is conceived altogether in homers spirit and is a very noble incident in this wonderful description homer when he speaks of the gods ascribes to them several arms and instruments with the same greatness of imagination let the reader only peruse the description of minervas aegis or buckler in the fifth book of the iliad with her spear which would overturn whole squadrons and her helmet that was sufficient to cover an army drawn out of an hundred cities the golden compasses in the abovementioned passage appear a very natural instrument in the hand of him whom plato somewhere calls the divine geometrician as poetry delights in clothing abstracted ideas in allegories and sensible images we find a magnificent description of the creation formed after the same manner in one of the prophets wherein he describes the almighty architect as measuring the waters in the hollow of his hand meteing out the heavens with his span comprehending the dust of the earth in a measure weighing the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance another of them describing the supreme being in this great work of creation represents him as laying the foundations of the earth and stretching a line upon it and in another place as garnishing the heavens stretching out the north over the empty place and hanging the earth upon nothing this last noble thought milton has expressed in the following verse and earth selfbalancd on her center hung   the beauties of description in this book lie so very thick that it is impossible to enumerate them in this paper the poet has employed on them the whole energy of our tongue the several great scenes of the creation rise up to view one after another in such a manner that the reader seems present at this wonderful work and to assist among the choirs of angels who are the spectators of it how glorious is the conclusion of the first day  thus was the first day even and morn nor past uncelebrated nor unsung by the celestial quires when orient light exhaling first from darkness they beheld birthday of heaven and earth with joy and shout the hollow universal orb they filled   we have the same elevation of thought in the third day when the mountains were brought forth and the deep was made immediately the mountains huge appear emergent and their broad bare backs upheave into the clouds their tops ascend the sky so high as heaved the tumid hills so low down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep capacious bed of waters    we have also the rising of the whole vegetable world described in this days work which is filled with all the graces that other poets have lavished on their description of the spring and leads the readers imagination into a theater equally surprising and beautiful  the several glories of the heavens make their appearance on the fourth day first in his east the glorious lamp was seen regent of day and all the horizon round invested with bright rays jocund to run his longitude through heavens high rode the gray awn and the pleiades before him danced shedding sweet influence less bright the moon but opposite in levelled west was set his mirror with full face borrowing her light from him for other light she needed none in that aspect and still the distance keeps till night then in the east her turn she shines revolved on heavens great axle and her reign with thousand lesser lights dividual holds with thousand thousand stars that then appeared spangling the hemisphere    one would wonder how the poet could be so concise in his description of the six days works as to comprehend them within the bounds of an episode and at the same time so particular as to give us a lively idea of them this is still more remarkable in his account of the fifth and sixth days in which he has drawn out to our view the whole animal creation from the reptil to the behemoth as the lion and the leviathan are two of the noblest productions in the world of living creatures the reader will find a most exquisite spirit of poetry in the account which our author gives us of them the sixth day concludes with the formation of man upon which the angel takes occasion as he did after the battle in heaven to remind adam of his obedience which was the principal design of this his visit  the poet afterward represents the messiah returning into heaven and taking a survey of his great work there is something inexpressibly sublime in this part of the poem where the author describes that great period of time filled with so many glorious circumstances when the heavens and earth were finished when the messiah ascended up in triumph through the everlasting gates when he looked down with pleasure upon his new creation when every part of nature seemed to rejoice in its existence when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy so even and morn accomplished the sixth day yet not till the creator from his work desisting though unwearied up returned up to the heaven of heavens his high abode thence to behold this new created world the addition of his empire how it showed in prospect from his throne how good how fair answering his great idea up he rode followed with acclamation and the sound symphonious of ten thousand harps that tuned angelic harmonies the earth the air resoxnding thou rememberst for thou heardst the heavens and all the constellations rung the planets in their station listening stood while the bright pomp ascended jubilant open ye everlasting gates they sung open ye heavens your living doors let in the great creator from his work returned magnificent his six days work a world   i cannot conclude this book upon the creation without mentioning a poem which has lately appeared under that title the work was undertaken with so good an intention and is executed with so great a mastery that it deserves to be looked upon as one of the most useful and noble productions in our english verse the reader cannot but be pleased to find the depths of philosophy enlivened with all the charms of poetry and to see so great a strength of reason amidst so beautiful a redundancy of the imagination the author has shown us that design in all the works of nature which necessarily leads us to the knowledge of its first cause in short he has illustrated by numberless and incontestable instances that divine wisdom which the son of sirach has so nobly ascribed to the supreme being in his formation of the world when he tells us that he created her and saw her and numbered her and poured her out upon all his works  spectator no     sanctius hic animal mentisque capacius altae decrat adhuc et quod dominari in caetera posset natus homo est  ov met the accounts which raphael gives of the battle of angels and the creation of the world have in them those qualifications which the critics judge requisite to an episode they are nearly related to the principal action and have a just connection with the fable  the eighth book opens with a beautiful description of the impression which this discourse of the archangel made on our first parents adam afterward by a very natural curiosity enquries concerning the motions of those celestial bodies which make the most glorious appearance among the six days works the poet here with a great deal of art represents eve as withdrawing from this part of their conversation to amusements more suitable to her sex he well knew that the episode in this book which is filled with adams account of his passion and esteem for eve would have been improper for her hearing and has therefore devised very just and beautiful reasons for her retiring so spoke our sire and by his countenance seemed entering on studious thoughts abstruse which eve perceiving where she sat retired in sight with lowliness majestic from her seat and grace that won who saw to wish her stay rose and went forth among her fruits and flowers to visit how they prosperd bud and bloom her nursery they at her coming sprung and touched by her fair tendance gladlier grew yet went she not as not with such discourse delighted or not capable her ear of what was high such pleasure she reserved adam relating she sole auditress her husband the relater she preferred before the angel and of him to ask chose father he she knew would intermix grateful digressions and solve high dispute with conjugal caresses from his lip not words alone pleased her o when meet now such pairs in love and mutual honor joined   the angels returning a doubtful answer to adams enquiries was not only proper for the moral reason which the poet assigns but because it would have been highly absurd to have given the sanction of an archangel to any particular system of philosophy the chief points in the ptolemaick and copernican hypothesis are described with great conciseness and perspicuity and at the same time dressed in very pleasing and poetical images  adam to detain the angel enters afterward upon his own history and relates to him the circumstances in which he found himself upon his creation as also his conversation with his maker and his first meeting with eve there is no part of the poem more apt to raise the attention of the reader than this discourse of our great ancestor as nothing can be more surprising and delightful to us than to hear the sentiments that arose in the first man while he was yet new and fresh from the hands of his creator the poet has interwoven every thing which is delivered upon this subject in holy writ with so many beautiful imaginations of his own that nothing can be conceived more just and natural than this whole episode as our author knew this subject could not but be agreeable to his reader he would not throw it into the relation of the six days works but reserved it for a distinct episode that he might have an opportunity of expatiating upon it more at large before i enter on this part of the poem i cannot but take notice of two shining passages in the dialogue between adam and the angel the first is that wherein our ancestor gives an account of the pleasure he took in conversing with him which contains a very noble moral for while i sit with thee i seem in heaven and sweeter thy discourse is to my ear than fruits of palm tree pleasantest to thirst and hunger both from labor at the hour of sweet repast they satiate and soon fill though pleasant but thy words with grace divine imbued bring to their sweetness no satiety   the other i shall mention is that in which the angel gives a reason why he should be glad to hear the story adam was about to relate for i that day was absent as befell bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure far on excursion toward the gates of hell squared in full legion such command we had to see that none thence issued forth a spy or enemy while god was in his work lest he incenst at such eruption bold destruction with creation might have mixed   there is no question but our poet drew the image in what follows from that in virgils sixth book where aeneas and the sybil stand before the adamantine gates which are there described as shut upon the place of torments and listen to the groans the clank of chains and the noise of iron whips that were heard in those regions of pain and sorrow  fast we found fast shut the dismal gates and barricadoed strong but long ever our approaching heard within noise other than the sound of dance or song torment and loud lament and furious rage   adam then proceeds to give an account of his condition and sentiments immediately after his creation how agreeably does he represent the posture in which he found himself the delightful landscape that surrounded him and the gladness of heart which grew up in him on that occasion  as new waked from soundest sleep soft on the flowery herb i found me laid in balmy sweat which with his beams the sun soon dried and on the reaking moisture fed straight toward heaven my wondering eyes i turned and gazed a while the amply sky till raised by quick instinctive motion up i sprung as thitherward endeavoring and upright stood on my feet about me round i saw hill dale and shady woods and sunny plains and liquid lapse of murmuring streams by these creatures that lived and moved and walked or flew birds on the branches warbling all things smiled with fragrance and with joy my heart oerflowd   adam is afterward described as surpised at his own existence and taking a survey of himself and of all the works of nature he likewise is represented as discovering by the light of reason that he and every thing about him must have been the effect of some being infinitely good and powerful and that this being had a right to his worship and adoration his first address to the sun and to those parts of the creation which made the most distinguished figure is very natural and amusing to the imagination  thou sun said i fair light and thou enlightned earth so fresh and gay ye hills and dales ye rivers woods and plains and ye that live and move fair creatures tell tell if you saw how came i thus how here   his next sentiment when upon his first going to sleep he fancies himself losing his existence and falling away into nothing can never be sufficiently admired his dream in which he still preserves the consciousness of his existence together with his removal into the garden which was prepared for his reception are also circumstances finely imagined and grounded upon what is delivered in sacred story  these and the like wonderful incidents in this part of the work have in them all the beauties of novelty at the same time that they have all the graces of nature they are such as none but a great genius could have thought of though upon the perusal of them they seem to rise of themselves from the subject of which he treats in a word though they are natural they are not obvious which is the true character of all fine writing  the impression which the interdiction of the tree of life left in the mind of our first parent is described with great strength and judgment as the image of the several beasts and birds passing in review before him is very beautiful and lively  each bird and beast behold approaching two and two these cowring low with blandishment each bird stooped on his wing i named them as they passed    adam in the next place describes a conference which he held with his maker upon the subject of solitude the poet here represents the supreme being as making an essay of his own work and putting to the trial that reasoning faculty with which he had endued his creature adam urges in this divine colloquy the impossibility of his being happy though he was the inhabitant of paradise and lord of the whole creation without the conversation and society of some rational creature who should partake those blessings with him this dialogue which is supported chiefly by the beauty of the thoughts without other poetical ornaments is as fine a part as any in the whole poem the more the reader examines the justness and delicacy of its sentiments the more he will find himself pleased with it the poet has wonderfully preserved the character of majesty and condescension in the creator and at the same time that of humility and adoration in the creature as particularly in the following lines thus i presumptuous and the vision bright as with a smile more brightned thus replied etc  i with leave of speech implored and humble deprecation thus replied let not my words offend thee heavenly power my maker be propitious while i speak etc   adam then proceeds to give an account of his second sleep and of the dream in which he beheld the formation of eve the new passion that was awakened in him at the sight of her is touched very finely under his forming hands a creature grew manlike but different sex so lovely fair that what seemed fair in all the world seemed now mean or in her summed up in her contained and in her looks which from that time infused sweetness into my heart unfelt before and into all things from her air inspir d the spirit of love and amorous delight   adams distress upon losing sight of this beautiful phantom with his exclamations of joy and gratitude at the discovery of a real creature who resembled the apparition which had been presented to him in his dream the approaches he makes to her and his manner of courtship are all laid together in a most exquisite propriety of sentiments  though this part of the poem is worked up with great warmth and spirit the love which is described in it is every way suitable to a state of innocence if the reader compares the description which adam here gives of his leading eve to the nuptial bower with that which mr dryden has made on the same occasion in a scene of his fall of man he will be sensible of the great care which milton took to avoid all thoughts on so delicate a subject that might be offensive to religion or good manners the sentiments are chaste but not cold and convey to the mind ideas of the most transporting passion and of the greatest purity what a noble mixture of rapture and innocence has the author joined together in the reflection which adam makes on the pleasures of love compared to those of sense thus have i told thee all my state and brought my story to the sum of earthly bliss which i enjoy and must confess to find in all things else delight indeed but such as used or not works in the mind no change nor vehement desire these delicacies i mean of taste sight smell herbs fruits and flowers walks and the melody of birds but here far otherwise transported i behold transported touch here passion first i felt commotion strange in all enjoyments else superior and unmoved here only weak against the charm of beautys powerful glance or nature failed in me and left some part not proof enough such object to sustain or from my side subducting took perhaps more than enough at least on her bestowed too much of ornament in outward show elaborate of inward less exact  when i approach her loveliness so absolute she seems and in herself complete so well to know her own that what she wills to do or say seems wisest virtuousest discreetest best all higher knowledge in her presence falls degraded wisdom in discourse with her loses discountenanced and like folly shows authority and reason on her wait as one intended first not after made occasionally and to consummate all greatness of mind and nobleness their seat build in her loveliest and create an awe about her as a guard angelick placed   these sentiments of love in our first parent gave the angel such an insight into humane nature that he seems apprehensive of the evils which might befall the species in general as well as adam in particular from the excess of this passion he therefore fortifies him against it by timely admonitions which very artfully prepare the mind of the reader for the occurrences of the next book where the weakness of which adam here gives such distant discoveries brings about that fatal event which is the subject of the poem his discourse which follows the gentle rebuke he received from the angel shows that his love however violent it might appear was still founded in reason and consequently not improper for paradise neither her outside form so fair nor ought in procreation common to all kinds though higher of the genial bed by far and with mysterious reverence i deem so much delights me as those graceful acts those thousand decencies that daily flow from all her words and actions mixed with love and sweet compliance which declare unfeigned union of mind or in us both one soul harmony to behold in wedded pair   adams speech at parting with the angel has in it a deference and gratitude agreeable to an inferior nature and at the same time a certain dignity and greatness suitable to the father of mankind in his state of innocence  spectator no      in te omnis domus inclinata recumbit virg if we look into the three great heroic poems which have appeared in the world we may observe that they are built upon very slight foundations homer lived near  00 years after the trojan war and as the writing of history was not then in use among the greeks we may very well suppose that the tradition of achilles and ulysses had brought down but very few particulars to his knowledge though there is no question but he has wrought into his two poems such of their remarkable adventures as were still talked of among his contemporaties  the story of aeneas on which virgil founded his poem was likewise very bare of circumstances and by that means afforded him an opportunity of embellishing it with fiction and giving a full range to his own invention we find however that he has interwoven in the course of his fable the principal particulars which were generally believed among the romans of aeneas his voyage and settlement in italy  the reader may find an abridgment of the whole story as collected out of the ancient historians and as it was received among the romans in dionysius halicarnasseus  since none of the critics have considered virgils fable with relation to this history of aeneas it may not perhaps be amiss to examine it in this light so far as regards my present purpose whoever looks into the abridgment abovementioned will find that the character of aeneas is filled with piety to the gods and a superstitious observation of prodigies oracles and predictions virgil has not only preserved this character in the person of aeneas but has given a place in his poem to those particular prophecies which he found recorded of him in history and tradition the poet took the matters of fact as they came down to him and circumstanced them after his own manner to make them appear the more natural agreeable or surprising i believe very many readers have been shocked at that ludicrous prophecy which one of the harpeys pronounces to the trojans in the third book namely that before they had built their intended city they should be reduced by hunger to eat their very tables but when they hear that this was one of the circumstances that had been transmitted to the romans in the history of aeneas they will think the poet did very well in taking notice of it the historian abovementioned acquaints us a prophetess had foretold aeneas that he should take his voyage westward till his companions should eat their tables and that accordingly upon his landing in italy as they were eating their flesh upon cakes of bread for want of other conveniences they afterward fed on the cakes themselves upon which one of the company said merrily we are eating our tables they immediately took the hint says the historian and concluded the prophecy to be fulfilled as virgil did not think it proper to omit so material a particular in the history of aeneas it may be worth while to consider with how much judgment he has qualified it and taken off every thing that might have appeared improper for a passage in an heroic poem the prophetess who foretells it is an hungry harpy as the person who discovers it is young ascanius heus etiam mensas consumimus inquit lulus   such an observation which is beautiful in the mouth of a boy would have been ridiculous from any other of the company i am apt to think that the changing of the trojan fleet into waternymphs which is the most violent machine in the whole aeneid and has given offense to several critics may be accounted for the same way virgil himself before he begins that relation premises that what he was going to tell appeared incredible but that it was justified by tradition what further confirms me that this change of the fleet was a celebrated circumstance in the history of aeneas is that ovid has given a place to the same metamorphosis in his account of the heathen mythology  none of the critics i have met with having considered the fable of the aeneid in this light and taken notice how the tradition on which it was founded authorizes those parts in it which appear the most exceptionable i hope the length of this reflection will not make it unacceptable to the curious part of my readers  the history which was the basis of miltons poem is still shorter than either that of the iliad or aeneid the poet has likewise taken care to insert every circumstance of it in the body of his fable the ninth book which we are here to consider is raised upon that brief account in scripture wherein we are told that the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field that he tempted the woman to eat of the forbidden fruit that she was overcome by this temptation and that adam followed her example from these few particulars milton has formed one of the most entertaining fables that invention ever produced he has disposed of these several circumstances among so many agreeable and natural fictions of his own that his whole story looks only like a comment upon sacred writ or rather seems to be a full and complete relation of what the other is only an epitome i have insisted the longer on this consideration as i look upon the dispositionand contrivance of the fable to be the principal beauty of the ninth book which has more story in it and is fuller of incidents than any other in the whole poem satans traversing the globe and still keeping within the shadow of the night as fearing to be discovered by the angel of the sun who had before detected him is one of those beautiful imaginations with which he introduces this his second series of adventures having examined the nature of every creature and found out one which was the most proper for his purpose he again returns to paradise and to avoid discovery sinks by night with a river that ran under the garden and rises up again through a fountain that issued from it by the tree of life the poet who as we have before taken notice speaks as little as possible in his own person and after the example of homer fills every part of his work with manners and characters introduces a soliloquy of this infernal agent who was thus restless in the destruction of man he is then described as gliding through the garden under the resemblance of a mist in order to find out that creature in which he designed to tempt our first parents this description has something in it very poetical and surprising so saying through each thicket dank or dry like a black mist low creeping he held on his midnight search where soonest he might find the serpent him fast sleeping soon he found in labyrinth of many a round selfrolld his head the midst well stored with subtle wiles   the author afterward gives us a description of the morning which is wonderfully suitable to a divine poem and peculiar to that first season of nature he represents the earth before it was cursed as a great altar breathing out its incense from all parts and sending up a pleasant savor to the nostrils of its creator to which he adds a noble idea of adam and eve as offering their morning worship and filling up the universal consort of praise and adoration now when as sacred light began to dawn in eden on the humid flowers that breathed their morning incense when all things that breath from the earths great altar send up silent praise to the creator and his nostrils fill with grateful smell forth came the human pair and joined their vocal worship to the choir of creatures wanting voice    the dispute which follows between our two first parents is represented with great art it proceeds from a difference of judgment not of passion and is managed with reason not with heat it is such a dispute as we may suppose might have happened in paradise had man continued happy and innocent there is a great delicacy in the moralities which are interspersed in adams discourse and which the most ordinary reader cannot but take notice of that force of love which the father of mankind so finely describes in the eighth book and which is inserted in the foregoing paper shows it self here in many fine instances as in those fond regards he cast toward eve at her parting from him her long with ardent look his eye pursued delighted but desiring more her stay often he to her his charge of quick return repeated she to him as often engaged to be returned by noon amid the bower   in his impatience and amusement during her absence  adam the while waiting desirous her return had wove of choicest flowers a garland to adorn her tresses and her rural labors crown as reapers often are wont their harvest queen great joy he promised to his thoughts and new solace in her return so long delayed   but particularly in that passionate speech where seeing her irrecoverably lost he resolves to perish with her rather than to live without her  some cursed fraud or enemy has beguiled thee yet unknown and me with thee has ruined for with thee certain my resolution is to die how can i live without thee how forego thy sweet converse and love so dearly joined to live again in these wild woods forlorn should god create another eve and i another rib afford yet loss of thee would never from my heart no no i feel the link of nature draw me flesh of flesh bone of my bone thou art and from thy state mine never shall be parted bliss or woe   the beginning of this speech and the preparation to it are animated with the same spirit as the conclusion which i have here quoted  the several wiles which are put in practice by the tempter when he found eve separated from her husband the many pleasing images of nature which are intermixed in this part of the story with its gradual and regular progress to the fatal catastrophe are so very remarkable that it would be superfluous to point out their respective beauties  i have avoided mentioning any particular similitudes in my remarks on this great work because i have given a general account of them in my paper on the first book there is one however in this part of the poem which i shall here quote as it is not only very beautiful but the closest of any in the whole poem i mean that where the serpent is described as rolling forward in all his pride animated by the evil spirit and conducting eve to her destruction while adam was at too great a distance from her to give her his assistance these several particulars are all of them wrought into the following similitude  hope elevates and joy brightens his crest as when a wandering fire compact of unctuous vapor which the night condenses and the cold invirons round kindled through agitation to a flame which often they say some evil spirit attends hovering and blazing with delusive light misleads the amazed nightwanderer from his way to bogs and mires and often through pond or pool there swallowed up and lost from succor far   that secret intoxication of pleasure with all those transient flushings of guilt and joy which the poet represents in our first parents upon their eating the forbidden fruit to those flaggings of spirit damps of sorrow and mutual accusations which succeed it are conceived with a wonderful imagination and described in very natural sentiments  when dido in the fourth aeneid yielded to that fatal temptation which ruined her virgil tells us the earth trembled the heavens were filled with flashes of lightning and the nymphs howled upon the mountain tops milton in the same poetical spirit has described all nature as disturbed upon eves eating the forbidden fruit so saying her rash hand in evil hour forth reaching to the fruit she plucked she eat earth felt the wound and nature from her seat sighing through all her works gave signs of woe that all was lost    upon adams falling into the same guilt the whole creation appears a second time in convulsions  he scrupled not to eat against his better knowledge not deceived but fondly overcome with female charm earth trembled from her entrails as again in pangs and nature gave a second groan sky lowred and muttering thunder some sad drops wept at completing of the mortal sin    as all nature suffered by the guilt of our first parents these symptoms of trouble and consternation are wonderfully imagined not only as prodigies but as marks of her sympathizing in the fall of man  adams converse with eve after having eaten the forbidden fruit is an exact copy of that between jupiter and juno in the fourteenth iliad juno there approaches jupiter with the girdle which she had received from venus upon which he tells her that she appeared more charming and desirable than she had ever done before even when their loves were at the highest the poet afterward describes them as reposing on a summet of mount ida which produced under them a bed of flowers the lotus the crocus and the hyacinth and concludes his description with their falling asleep  let the reader compare this with the following passage in milton which begins with adams speech to eve for never did thy beauty since the day i saw thee first and wedded thee adorned with all perfections so inflame my sense with ardor to enjoy thee fairer now than ever bounty of this virtuous tree so said be and forbore not glance or toy of amorous intent well understood of eve whose eye darted contagious fire her hand he seized and to a shady bank thick overhead with verdant roof embowrd he led her nothing loath flowers were the couch pansies and violets and asphodel and hyacinth earths freshest softest lap there they their fill of love and loves disport took largely of their mutual guilt the seal the solace of their sin till dewy sleep oppressed them    as no poet seems ever to have studied homer more or to have resembled him in the greatness of genius than milton i think i should have given but a very imperfect account of his beauties if i had not observed the most remarkable passages which look like parallels in these two great authors i might in the course of these criticisms have taken notice of many particular lines and expressions which are translated from the greek poet but as i thought this would have appeared too minute and overcurious i have purposely omitted them the greater incidents however are not only set off by being shown in the same light with several of the same nature in homer but by that means may be also guarded against the cavils of the tasteless or ignorant  spectator no      quis talia fando temperet a lacrymis  virg the tenth book of paradise lost has a greater variety of persons in it than any other in the whole poem the author upon the winding up of his action introduces all those who had any concern in it and shows with great beauty the influence which it had upon each of them it is like the last act of a well written tragedy in which all who had a part in it are generally drawn up before the audience and represented under those circumstances in which the determination of the action places them  i shall therefore consider this book under four heads in relation to the celestial the infernal the human and the imaginary persons who have their respective parts allotted in it  to begin with the celestial persons the guardian angels of paradise are described as returning to heaven upon the fall of man in order to approve their vigilance their arrival their manner of reception with the sorrow which appeared in themselves and in those spirits who are said to rejoice at the conversion of a sinner are very finely laid together in the following lines up into heaven from paradise in haste the angelick guards ascended mute and sad for man for of his state by this they knew much wondering how the subtle fiend had stolen entrance unseen soon as the unwelcome news from earth arrived at heaven gate displeased all were who heard dim sadness did not spare that time celestial visages yet mixed with pity violated not their bliss about the newarrivd in multitudes the ethereal people ran to hear and know how all befell they toward the throne supreme accountable made haste to make appear with righteous plea their utmost vigilance and easily approved when the most high eternal father from his secret cloud amidst in thunder uttered thus his voice   the same divine person who in the foregoing parts of this poem interceded for our first parents before their fall overthrew the rebel angels and created the world is now represented as descending to paradise and pronouncing sentence upon the three offenders the cool of the evening being a circumstance with which holy writ introduces this great scene it is poetically described by our author who has also kept religiously to the form of words in which the three several sentences were passed upon adam eve and the serpent he has rather chosen to neglect the numerousness of his verse than to deviate from those speeches which are recorded on this great occasion the guilt and confusion of our first parents standing naked before their judge is touched with great beauty upon the arrival of sin and death into the works of the creation the almighty is again introduced as speaking to his angels that surrounded him see with what heat these dogs of hell advance to waste and havoc yonder world which i so fair and good created etc   the following passage is formed upon that glorious image in holy writ which compares the voice of an innumerable host of angels uttering hallelujahs to the voice of mighty thunderings or of many waters he ended and the heavenly audience loud sung hallelujah as the sound of seas through multitude that sung just are thy ways righteous are thy decrees in all thy works who can extenuate thee    though the author in the whole course of his poem and particularly in the book we are now examining has infinite allusions to places of scripture i have only taken notice in my remarks of such as are of a poetical nature and which are woven with great beauty into the body of this fable of this kind is that passage in the present book where describing sin and death as marching through the works of nature he adds  behind her death close following pace for pace not mounted yet on his pale horse  which alludes to that passage in scripture so wonderfully poetical and terrifying to the imagination and i looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with hunger and with sickness and with the beasts of the earth under this first head of celestial persons we must likewise take notice of the command which the angels received to produce the several changes in nature and sully the beauty of the creation accordingly they are represented as infecting the stars and planets with malignant influences weakening the light of the sun bringing down the winter into the milder regions of nature planting winds and storms in several quarters of the sky storing the clouds with thunder and in short perverting the whole frame of the universe to the condition of its criminal inhabitants as this is a noble incident in the poem the following lines in which we see the angels heaving up the earth and placing it in a different posture to the sun from what it had before the fall of man is conceived with that sublime imagination which was so peculiar to this great author some say he bid his angels turn ascance the poles of earth twice ten degrees and more from the suns axle they with labor pushed oblique the centrick globe    we are in the second place to consider the infernal agents under the view which milton has given us of them in this book it is observed by those who would set forth the greatness of virgils plan that he conducts his reader through all the parts of the earth which were discovered in his time asia africa and europe are the several scenes of his fable the plan of miltons poem is of an infinitely greater extent and fills the mind with many more astonishing circumstances satan having surrounded the earth seven times departs at length from paradise we then see him steering his course among the constellations and after having traversed the whole creation pursuing his voyage through the chaos and entering into his own infernal dominions  his first appearance in the assembly of fallen angels is worked up with circumstances which give a delightful surprise to the reader but there is no incident in the whole poem which does this more than the transformation of the whole audience that follows the account their leader gives them of his expedition the gradual change of satan himself is described after ovids manner and may vie with any of those celebrated transformations which are looked upon as the most beautiful parts in that poets works milton never fails of improving his own hints and bestowing the last finishing touches to every incident which is admitted into his poem the unexpected hiss which rises in this episode the dimensions and bulk of satan so much superior to those of the infernal spirits who lay under the same transformation with the annual change which they are supposed to suffer are instances of this kind the beauty of the diction is very remarkable in this whole episode as i have observed in the sixth paper of these remarks the great judgment with which it was contrived  the parts of adam and eve or the humane persons come next under our consideration miltons art is no where more shown than in his conducting the parts of these our first parents the representation he gives of them without falsifying the story is wonderfully contrived to influence the reader with pity and compassion toward them though adam involves the whole species in misery his crime proceeds from a weakness which every man is inclined to pardon and commiserate as it seems rather the frailty of humane nature than of the person who offended every one is apt to excuse a fault which he himself might have fallen into it was the excess of love for eve that ruined adam and his posterity i need not add that the author is justified in this particular by many of the fathers and the most orthodox writers milton has by this means filled a great part of his poem with that kind of writing which the french critics call the tender and which is in a particular manner engaging to all sorts of readers  adam and eve in the book we are now considering are likewise drawn with such sentiments as do not only interest the reader in their afflictions but raise in him the most melting passions of humanity and commiseration when adam sees the several changes in nature produced about him he appears in a disorder of mind suitable to one who had forfeited both his innocence and his happiness he is filled with horror remorse despair in the anguish of his heart he expostulates with his creator for having given him an unasked existence did i request thee maker from my clay to mould me man did i solicit thee from darkness to promote me or here place in this delicious garden as my will concurred not to my being twere but right and equal to reduce me to my dust desirous to resign and render back all i received  he immediately after recovers from his presumption owns his doom to be just and begs that the death which is threatened him may be inflicted on him  why delays his hand to execute what his decree fixed on this day why do i overlive why am i mocked with death and lengthened out to deathless pain how gladly would i meet mortality my sentence and be earth insensible how glad would lay me down as in my mothers lap there should i rest and sleep secure his dreadful voice no more would thunder in my ears no fear of worse to me and to my offspring would torment me with cruel expectation    this whole speech is full of the like emotion and varied with all those sentiments which we may suppose natural to a mind so broken and disturbed i must not omit that generous concern which our first father shows in it for his posterity and which is so proper to affect the reader  hide me from the face of god whom to behold was then my height of happiness yet well if here would end the misery i deserved it and would bear my own deservings but this will not serve all that i eat or drink or shall beget is propagated curse o voice once heard delightfully increase and multiply now death to hear   in me all posterity stands cursed fair patrimony that i must leave you sons o were i able to waste it all my self and leave you none so disinherited how would you bless me now your curse ah why should all mankind for one mans fault thus guiltless be condemned if guiltless but from me what can proceed but all corrupt    who can afterward behold the father of mankind extended upon the earth uttering his midnight complaints bewailing his existence and wishing for death without sympathizing with him in his distress thus adam to himself lamented loud through the still night not now as ever man fell wholesome and cool and mild but with black air accompanied with damps and dreadful gloom which to his evil conscience represented all things with double terror on the ground outstretchd he lay on the cold ground and often cursed his creation death as often accused of tardy execution    the part of eve in this book is no less passionate and apt to sway the reader in her favor she is represented with great tenderness as approaching adam but is spurned from him with a spirit of upbraiding and indignation conformable to the nature of man whose passions had now gained the dominion over him the following passage wherein she is described as renewing her addresses to him with the whole speech that follows it have something in them exquisitely moving and pathetick he added not and from her turned but eve not so repulsed with tears that ceased not flowing and tresses all disordered at his feet fell humble and embracing them besought his peace and thus proceeded in her plaint forsake me not thus adam witness heaven what love sincere and reverence in my heart i bear thee and unweeting have offended unhappily deceived thy suppliant i beg and clasp thy knees bereave me not whereon i live thy gentle looks thy aid thy counfel in this uttermost distress my only strength and stay forlorn of thee whither shall i betake me where subsist while yet we live scarce one short hour perhaps between us two let there be peace etc   adams reconcilement to her is worked up in the same spirit of tenderness eve afterward proposes to her husband in the blindness of her despair that to prevent their guilt from descending upon posterity they should resolve to live childless or if that could not be done they should seek their own deaths by violent methods as those sentiments naturally engage the reader to regard the mother of mankind with more than ordinary commiseration they likewise contain a very fine moral the resolution of dying to end our miseries does not show such a degree of magnanimity as a resolution to bear them and submit to the dispensations of providence our author has therefore with great delicacy represented eve as entertaining this thought and adam as disapproving it  we are in the last place to consider the imaginary persons or death and sin who act a large part in this book such beautiful extended allegories are certainly some of the finest compositions of genius but as i have before observed are not agreeable to the nature of an heroic poem this of sin and death is very exquisite in its kind if not considered as a part of such a work the truths contained in it are so clear and open that i shall not lose time in explaining them but shall only observe that a reader who knows the strength of the english tongue will be amazed to think how the poet could find such apt words and phrases to describe the actions of those two imaginary persons and particularly in that part where death is exhibited as forming a bridge over the chaos a work suitable to the genius of milton  since the subject i am upon gives me an opportunity of speaking more at large of such shadowy and imaginary persons as may be introduced into heroic poems i shall beg leave to explain my self in a matter which is curious in its kind and which none of the critics have treated of it is certain homer and virgil are full of imaginary persons who are very beautiful in poetry when they are just shown without being engaged in any series of action homer indeed represents sleep as a person and ascribes a short part to him in his iliad but we must consider that though we now regard such a person as entirely shadowy and unsubstantial the heathens made statues of him placed him in their temples and looked upon him as a real deity when homer makes use of other such allegorical persons it is only in short expressions which convey an ordinary thought to the mind in the most pleasing manner and may rather be looked upon as poetical phrases than allegorical descriptions instead of telling us that men naturally fly when they are terrified he introduces the persons of flight and fear who he tells us are inseparable companions instead of saying that the time was come when apollo ought to have received his recompense he tells us that the hours brought him his reward instead of describing the effects which minervas aegis produced in battle he tells us that the brims of it were encompassed by terror rout discord fury pursuit massacre and death in the same figure of speaking he represents victory as following diomedes discord as the mother of funerals and mourning venus as dressed by the graces bellona as wearing terror and consternation like a garment i might give several other instances out of homer as well as a great many out of virgil milton has likewise very often made use of the same way of speaking as where he tells us that victory sat on the right hand of the messiah when he marched forth against the rebel angels that at the rising of the sun the hours unbarrd the gates of light that discord was the daughter of sin of the same nature are those expressions where describing the singing of the nightingale he adds silence was pleased and upon the messiahs bidding peace to the chaos confusion heard his voice i might add innumerable instances of our poets writing in this beautiful figure it is plain that these i have mentioned in which persons of an imaginary nature are introduced are such short allegories as are not designed to be taken in the literal sense but only to convey particular circumstances to the reader after an unusual and entertaining manner but when such persons are introduced as principal actors and engaged in a series of adventures they take too much upon them and are by no means proper for an heroic poem which ought to appear credible in its principal parts i cannot forbear therefore thinking that sin and death are as improper agents in a work of this nature as strength and necessity in one of the tragedies of eschylus who represented those two persons nailing down prometheus to a rock for which he has been justly censured by the greatest critics i do not know any imaginary person made use of in a more sublime manner of thinking than that in one of the prophets who describing god as descending from heaven and visiting the sins of mankind adds that dreadful circumstance before him went the pestilence it is certain this imaginary person might have been described in all her purple spots the fever might have marched before her pain might have stood at her right hand phrenzy on her left and death in her rear she might have been introduced as gliding down from the tail of a comet or darted upon the earth in a flash of lightning she might have tainted the atmosphere with her breath the very glaring of her eyes might have scattered infection but i believe every reader will think that in such sublime writings the mentioning of her as it is done in scripture has something in it more just as well as great than all that the most fanciful poet could have bestowed upon her in the richness of his imagination  spectator no      crudelis ubique luctus ubique pavor and plurima mortis imago virg milton has shown a wonderful art in describing that variety of passions which arise in our first parents upon the breach of the commandment that had been given them we see them gradually passing from the triumph of their guilt through remorse shame despair contrition prayer and hope to a perfect and complete repentance at the end of the tenth book they are represented as prostrating themselves upon the ground and watering the earth with their tears to which the poet joins this beautiful circumstance that they offered up their penitential prayers on the very place where their judge appeared to them when he pronounced their sentence  they forthwith to the place repairing where he judged them prostrate fell before him reverent and both confessed humbly their faults and pardon begged with tears watering the ground    there is a beauty of the same kind in a tragedy of sophocles where oedipus after having put out his own eyes instead of breaking his neck from the palace battlements which furnishes so elegant an entertainment for our english audience desires that he may be conducted to mount cithaeron in order to end his life in that very place where he was exposed in his infancy and where he should then have died had the will of his parents been executed  as the author never fails to give a poetical turn to his sentiments he describes in the beginning of this book the acceptance which these their prayers met with in a short allegory formed upon that beautiful passage in holy writ and another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden censer and there was given unto him much incense that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the saints ascended up before god  to heaven their prayers flew up nor missed the way by envious winds blown vagabond or frustrate in they passed dimentionless through heavenly doors then clad with incense where the golden altar fumed by their great intercessor came in sight before the fathers throne    we have the same thought expressed a second time in the intercession of the messiah which is conceived in very emphatick sentiments and expressions  among the poetical parts of scripture which milton has so finely wrought into this part of his narration i must not omit that wherein ezekiel speaking of the angels who appeared to him in a vision adds that every one had four faces and that their whole bodies and their backs and their hands and their wings were full of eyes round about  the cohort bright of watchful cherubim four faces each had like a double janus all their shape spangled with eyes    the assembling of all the angels of heaven to hear the solemn decree passed upon man is represented in very lively ideas the almighty is here described as remembering mercy in the midst of judgment and commanding michael to deliver his message in the mildest terms least the spirit of man which was already broken with the sense of his guilt and misery should fail before him  yet least they faint at the sad sentence rigorously urged for i behold them seftned and with tears bewailing their excess all terror hide   the conference of adam and eve is full of moving sentiments upon their going abroad after the melancholy night which they had passed together they discover the lion and the eagle pursuing each of them their prey toward the eastern gates of paradise there is a double beauty in this incident not only as it presents great and just omens which are always agreeable in poetry but as it expresses that enmity which was now produced in the animal creation the poet to show the like changes in nature as well as to grace his fable with a noble prodigy represents the sun in an eclipse this particular incident has likewise a fine effect upon the imagination of the reader in regard to what follows for at the same time that the sun is under an eclipse a bright cloud descends in the western quarter of the heavens filled with an host of angels and more luminous than the sun it self the whole theater of nature is darkened that this glorious machine may appear in all its luster and magnificence  why in the east darkness ever days midcourse and morning light more orient in that western cloud that draws over the blue firmament a radiant white and slow descends with something heavenly fraught he erred not for by this the heavenly bands down from a sky of jasper lighted now in paradise and on a hill made halt a glorious apparition    i need not observe how properly this author who always suits his parts to the actors whom he introduces has employed michael in the expulsion of our first parents from paradise the archangel on this occasion neither appears in his proper shape nor in that familiar manner with which raphael the sociable spirit entertained the father of mankind before the fall his person his port and behavior are suitable to a spirit of the highest rank and exquisitely described in the following passage  the archangel soon drew nigh not in his shape celestial but as man clad to meet man over his lucid arms a military vest of purple flowed livelier than melibzan or the grain of sarra worn by kings and heroes old in time of truce iris had dipped the wooff his starry helm unbuckled showed him prime in manhood where youth ended by his side as in a glistring zodiac hung the sword satans dixe dread and in his hand the spear adam bowed low he kingly from his state inclined not but his coming thus declared   eves complaint upon hearing that she was to be removed from the garden of paradise is wonderfully beautiful the sentiments are not only proper to the subject but have something in them particularly soft and womanish must i then leave thee paradise thus leave thee native soil these happy walks and shades fit haunt of gods where i had hope to spend quiet though sad the respite of that day that must be mortal to us both o flowers that never will in other climate grow my early visitation and my last at even which i bred up with tender hand from the first opening bud and gave you names who now shall rear you to the sun or rank your tribes and water from thambrosial fount thee lastly nuptial bower by me adorned with what to sight or smell was sweet from thee how shall i part and whither wander down into a lower world to this obscure and wild how shall we breath in other air less pure accustomed to immortal fruits   adams speech abounds with thoughts which are equally moving but of a more masculine and elevated turn nothing can be conceived more sublime and poetical than the following passage in it this most afflicts me that departing hence as from his face i shall be hid deprived his blessed countenance here i could frequent with worship place by place where he vouchsafed presence divine and to my sons relate on this mount he appeared under this tree stood visible among these pines his voice i heard here with him at this fountain talked so many grateful altars i would rear of grassy turf and pile up every stone of luster from the brook in memory or monument to ages and thereon offer sweet smelling gums and fruits and flowers in yonder nether world where shall i seek his bright appearances or footsteps trace for though i fled him angry yet recalled to life prolonged and promised race i now gladly behold though but his utmost skirts of glory and far off his steps adore   the angel afterward leads adam to the highest mount of paradise and lays before him a whole hemisphere as a proper stage for those visions which were to be represented on it i have before observed how the plan of miltons poem is in many particulars greater than that of the iliad or aeneid virgils hero in the last of these poems is entertained with a sight of all these who are to descend from him but though that episode is justly admired as one of the noblest designs in the whole aeneid every one must allow that this of milton is of a much higher nature adams vision is not confined to any particular tribe of mankind but extends to the whole species  in this great review which adam takes of all his sons and daughters the first objects he is presented with exhibit to him the story of cain and abel which is drawn together with much closeness and propriety of expression that curiosity and natural horror which arises in adam at the sight of the first dying man is touched with great beauty but have i now seen death is this the way i must return to native dust o sight of terror foul and ugly to behold horrid to think how horrible to feel   the second vision sets before him the image of death in a great variety of appearances the angel to give him a general idea of those effects which his guilt had brought upon his posterity places before him a large hospital or lazarhouse filled with persons lying under all kinds of mortal diseases how finely has the poet told us that the sick persons languished under lingering and incurable distempers by an apt and judicious use of such imaginary beings as those i mentioned in my last paper dire was the tossing deep the groans despair tended the sick busy from couch to couch and over them triumphant death his dart shook but delayed to strike though often invoked with vows as their chief good and final hope   the passion which likewise rises in adam on this occasion is very natural sight so deform what heart of rock could long dryeyed behold adam could not but wept though not of woman born compassion quelled his best of man and gave him up to tears   the discourse between the angel and adam which follows abounds with noble morals  as there is nothing more delightful in poetry than a contrast and opposition of incidents the author after this melancholy prospect of death and sickness raises up a scene of mirth love and jollity the secret pleasure that steals into adams heart as he is intent upon this vision is imagined with great delicacy i must not omit the description of the loose female troop who seduced the sons of god as they are called in scripture for that fair female troop thou saw that seemed of goddesses so blithe so smooth so gay yet empty of all good wherein consists womans domestic honor and chief praise bred only and completed to the taste of lustful appetence to sing to dance to dress and troule the tongue and roll the eye to these that sober race of men whose lives religious titled them the sons of god shall yield up all their virtue all their fame ignobly to the trains and to the smiles of those fair atheists    the next vision is of a quite contrary nature and filled with the horrors of war adam at the sight of it melts into tears and breaks out in that passionate speech  o what are these deaths ministers not men who thus deal death inhumanly to men and multiply ten thousand fold the sin of him who flew his brother for of whom such massacre make they but of their brethren men of men   milton to keep up an agreeable variety in his visions after having raised in the mind of his reader the several ideas of terror which are conformable to the description of war passes on to those softer images of triumphs and festivals in that vision of lewdness and luxury which ushers in the flood  as it is visible that the poet had his eye upon ovids account of the universal deluge the reader may observe with how much judgment he has avoided every thing that is redundant or puerile in the latin poet we do not here see the wolf swimming among the sheep nor any of those wanton imaginations which seneca found fault with as unbecoming the great catastrophe of nature if our poet has imitated that verse in which ovid tells us that there was nothing but sea and that this sea had no shore to it he has not set the thought in such a light as to incur the censure which critics have passed upon it the latter part of that verse in ovid is idle and superfluous but just and beautiful in milton jamque mare and tellus nullum discrimen habebant nil nisi pontus erat deerant queque littera ponto ovid  sea covered sea sea without shore  milton  in milton the former part of the description does not forestall the latter how much more great and solemn on this occasion is that which follows in our english poet  and in their palaces where luxury late reigned sea monsters whelpd and stabld  than that in ovid where we are told that the seacalfs lay in those places where the goats were used to browze the reader may find several other parallel passages in the latin and english description of the deluge wherein our poet has visibly the advantage the skys being over charged with clouds the descending of the rains the rising of the seas and the appearance of the rainbow are such descriptions as every one must take notice of the circumstance relating to paradise is so finely imagined and suitable to the opinions of many learned authors that i cannot forbear giving it a place in this paper  then shall this mount of paradise by might of waves be moved out of his place pushed by the horned stood with all his verdure spoiled and trees adrift down the great river to the opening gulf and there take root an island salt and bare the haunt of seals and orcs and seamews clang   the transition which the poet makes from the vision of the deluge to the concern it occasioned in adam is exquisitely graceful and copied after virgil though the first thought it introduces is rather in the spirit of ovid how did thou grieve then adam to behold the end of all thy offspring end so sad depopulation thee another flood of tears and sorrow a flood thee also drowned and sunk thee as thy sons till gently reared by the angel on thy feet thou stoodst at last though comfortless as when a father mourns his children all in view destroyed at once   i have been the more particular in my quotations out of the eleventh book of paradise lost because it is not generally reckoned among the most shining books of this poem for which reason the reader might be apt to overlook those many passages in it which deserve our admiration the eleventh and twelfth are indeed built upon that single circumstance of the removal of our first parents from paradise but though this is not in it self so great a subject as that in most of the foregoing books it is extended and diversified with so many surprising incidents and pleasing episodes that these two last books can by no means be looked upon as unequal parts of this divine poem i must further add that had not milton represented our first parents as driven out of paradise his fall of man would not have been complete and consequently his action would have been imperfect  spectator no     segnius irritant animos demissa per aures quam quae sunt oculis subjecta fidelibus  hor milton after having represented in vision the history of mankind to the first great period of nature dispatches the remaining part of it in narration he has devised a very handsome reason for the angels proceeding with adam after this manner though doubtless the true reason was the difficulty which the poet would have found to have shadowed out so mixed and complicated a story in visible objects i could wish however that the author had done it whatever pains it might have cost him to give my opinion freely i think that the exhibiting part of the history of mankind in vision and part in narrative is as if an historypainter should put in colors one half of his subject and write down the remaining part of it if miltons poem flags any where it is in this narration where in some places the author has been so attentive to his divinity that he has neglected his poetry the narration however rises very happily on several occasions where the subject is capable of poetical ornaments as particularly in the confusion which he describes among the builders of babel and in his short sketch of the plagues of egypt the storm of hail and fire with the darkness that overspread the land for three days are described with great strength the beautiful passage which follows is raised upon noble hints in scripture  thus with ten wounds the riverdragon tamed at length submits to let his sojourners depart and often humbles his stubborn heart but still as ice more hardened after thaw till in his rage pursuing whom he late dismissed the sea swallows him with his host but them lets pass as on dry land between two crystal walls awed by the red of moses so to stand divided    the riverdragon is an allusion to the crocodile which inhabits the nile from whence egypt derives her plenty this allusion is taken from that sublime passage in ezekiel thus says the lord god behold i am against thee pharaoh king of egypt the great dragon that lies in the midst of his rivers which has said my river is mine own and i have made it for my self milton has given us another very noble and poetical image in the same description which is copied almost word for word out of the history of moses all night he will pursue but his approach darkness defends between till morning watch then through the fiery pillar and the cloud god looking forth will trouble all his host and craze their chariotwheels when by command moses once more his potent rod extends over the sea the sea his rod obeys on their embattelld ranks the waves return and overwhelm their war    as the principal design of this episode was to give adam an idea of the holy person who was to reinstate humane nature in that happiness and perfection from which it had fallen the poet confines himself to the line of abraham from whence the messiah was to descend the angel is described as seeing the patriarch actually traveling toward the land of promise which gives a particular liveliness to this part of the narration i see him but thou can not with what faith he leaves his gods his friends his native soil ur of chaldaea passing now the ford to haran after him a cumbrous train of herds and flocks and numerous servitude not wand ring poor but trusting all his wealth with god who called him in a land unknown canaan he now attains i see his tents pitched about sechem and the neighboring plain of moroh there by promise he receives gift to his progeny of all that land from hamath northward to the desert south things by their names i call though yet unnamed   as virgils vision in the sixth aeneid probably gave milton the hint of this whole episode the last line is a translation of that verse where anchises mentions the names of places which they were to bear hereafter hac tum nomina erunt nunc sunt sine nomine terrae   the poet has very finely represented the joy and gladness of heart which rises in adam upon his discovery of the messiah as he sees his day at a distance through types and shadows he rejoices in it but when he finds the redemption of man completed and paradise again renewed he breaks forth in rapture and transport o goodness infinite goodness immense that all this good of evil shall produce etc   i have hinted in my sixth paper on milton that an heroic poem according to the opinion of the best critics ought to end happily and leave the mind of the reader after having conducted it through many doubts and fears sorrows and disquietudes in a state of tranquillity and satisfaction miltons fable which had so many other qualifications to recommend it was deficient in this particular it is here therefore that the poet has shown a most exquisite judgment as well as the finest invention by finding out a method to supply this natural defect in his subject accordingly he leaves the adversary of mankind in the last view which he gives us of him under the lowest state of mortification and disappointment we see him chewing ashes grovelling in the dust and laden with supernumerary pains and torments on the contrary our two first parents are comforted by dreams and visions cheared with promises of salvation and in a manner raised to a greater happiness than that which they had forfeited in short satan is represented miserable in the height of his triumphs and adam triumphant in the height of misery  miltons poem ends very nobly the last speeches of adam and the archangel are full of moral and instructive sentiments the sleep that fell upon eve and the effects it had in quieting the disorders of her mind produces the same kind of consolation in the reader who cannot peruse the last beautiful speech which is ascribed to the mother of mankind without a secret pleasure and satisfaction whence thou returnst and whither went i know for god is also in sleep and dreams advise which he has sent propitious some great good presaging since with sorrow and hearts distress wearied i fell asleep but now lead on in me is no delay with thee to go is to stay here without thee here to stay is to go hence unwilling thou to me art all things under heaven all places thou who for my wilful crime are banished hence this farther consolation yet secure i carry hence though all by me is lost such favor i unworthy am vouchsafed by me the promised seed shall all restore   the following lines which conclude the poem rise in a most glorious blaze of poetical images and expressions  heliodorvs in his aeshiopicks acquaints us that the motion of the gods differs from that of mortals as the former do not stir their feet nor proceed step by step but slide over the surface of the earth by an uniform swimming of the whole body the reader may observe with how poetical a description milton has attributed the same kind of motion to the angels who were to take possession of paradise so spoke our mother eve and adam heard well pleased but answered not for now too nigh the archangel stood and from the other hill to their fixed station all in bright array the cherubim descended on the ground gliding meteorons as evening mist risen from a river over the marish glides and gathers ground fast at the labrers heel homeward returning high in front advanced the brandished sword of god before them blazed fierce as a comet    the author helped his invention in the following passage by reflecting on the behavior of the angel who in holy writ has the conduct of lot and his family the circumstances drawn from that relation are very gracefully made use of on this occasion in either hand the hastening angel caught our lingering parents and to the eastern gate led them direct and down the cliff as fast to the subjected plain then disappeared they looking back etc   the scene which our first parents are surprised with upon their looking back on paradise wonderfully strikes the readers imagination as nothing can be more natural than the tears they shed or that occasion they looking back all the eastern side beheld of paradise so late their happy seat waved over by the flaming brand the gate with dreadful faces thronged and fiery arms some natural tears they dropped but wiped them soon the world was all before them where to choose their place of rest and providence their guide   if i might presume to offer at the smallest alteration in this divine work i should think the poem would end better with the passage here quoted than with the two verses which follow they hand in hand with wandering steps and slow through eden took their solitary way   these two verses though they have their beauty fall very much below the foregoing passage and renew in the mind of the reader that anguish which was pretty well laid by that consideration the world was all before them where to choose their place of rest and providence their guide   the number of books in paradise lost is equal to those of the aeneid our author in his first edition had divided his poem into ten books but afterward broke the seventh and the eleventh each of them into two different books by the help of some small additions this second division was made with great judgment as any one may see who will be at the pains of examining it it was not done for the sake of such a chimerical beauty as that of resembling virgil in this particular but for the more just and regular disposition of this great work  those who have read bossu and many of the critics who have written since his time will not pardon me if i do not find out the particular moral which is inculcated in paradise lost though i can by no means think with the lastmentioned french author that an epic writer first of all pitches upon a certain moral as the groundwork and foundation of his poem and afterward finds out a story to it i am however of opinion that no just heroic poem ever was or can be made from whence one great moral may not be deduced that which reigns in milton is the most universal and most useful that can be imagined it is in short this that obedience to the will of god makes men happy and that disobedience makes them miserable this is visibly the moral of the principal fable which turns upon adam and eve who continued in paradise while they kept the command that was given them and were driven out of it as soon as they had transgressed this is likewise the moral of the principal episode which shows us how an innumerable multitude of angels fell from their state of bliss and were cast into hell upon their disobedience besides this great moral which may be looked upon as the soul of the fable there are an infinity of under morals which are to be drawn from the several parts of the poem and which makes this work more useful and instructive than any other poem in any language  those who have criticized on the odissey the iliad and aeneid have taken a great deal of pains to fix the number of months or days contained in the action of each of those poems if any one thinks it worth his while to examine this particular in milton he will find that from adams first appearance in the fourth book to his expulsion from paradise in the twelfth the author reckons ten days as for that part of the action which is described in the three first books as it does not pass within the regions of nature i have before observed that it is not subject to any calculations of time  i have now finished my observations on a work which does an honor to the english nation i have taken a general view of it under those four heads the fable the characters the sentiments and the language and made each of them the subject of a particular paper i have in the next place spoken of the censures which our author may incur under each of these heads which i have confined to two papers though i might have enlarged the number if i had been disposed to dwell on so ungrateful a subject i believe however that the severest reader will not find any little fault in heroic poetry which this author has fallen into that does not come under one of those heads among which i have distributed his several blemishes after having thus treated at large of paradise lost i could not think it sufficient to have celebrated this poem in the whole without descending to particulars i have therefore bestowed a paper upon each book and endeavored not only to prove that the poem is beautiful in general but to point out its particular beauties and to determine wherein they consist i have endeavored to show how some passages are beautiful by being sublime others by being soft others by being natural which of them are recommended by the passion which by the moral which by the sentiment and which by the expression i have likewise endeavored to show how the genius of the poet shines by a happy invention a distant allusion or a judicious imitation how he has copied or improved homer or virgil and raised his own imaginations by the use which he has made of several poetical passages in scripture i might have inserted also several passages of tasso which our author has imitated but as i do not look upon tasso to be a sufficient voucher i would not perplex my reader with such quotations as might do more honor to the italian than the english poet in short i have endeavored to particularize those innumerable kinds of beauty which it would be tedious to recapitulate but which are essential to poetry and which may be met with in the works of this great author had i thought at my first engaging in this design that it would have led me to so great a length i believe i should never have entered upon it but the kind reception which it has met with among those whose judgments i have a value for give me no reason to repent of the pains i have been at in composing them  finis
