a treatise  teeth  price two shillings unbound  a treatise on the teeth  wherein an accurate idea of their structure is given the cause of their decay pointed out and their various diseases enumerated to which is added the most effectual method of treating the disorders of the teeth and gums established by a long and successful practice  by barth ruspini surgeon dentist  london printed for the author and may be had at his house in pall mall at s bladons in paternoster row and at all the booksellers etc in town and country       to the public it is needless to usher in this performance to the world by a preface in the common form proving the importance of the subject to be treated of and the necessity of taking it up at this time both are sufficiently felt and acknowledged it will therefore suffice that i briefly expose my intention in the following sheets submitting it to the candid and impartial public whether the execution is answerable to the design  i proposed first to give a distinct and accurate idea of the anatomy of the teeth and the adjacent parts to prevent as much as possible those accidents which arise from an ignorance in this point in the practice of unskiful practitioners who unacquainted with the structure of the parts never fail to expose their patients to unnecessary pain and frequently to dangerous consequences  secondly to point out the more immediate causes of the diseases of the teeth and to show how they may be mitigated and in some measure prevented  and thirdly to introduce and recommend a more general attention than has hitherto prevailed for the preservation of the teeth so useful to the purposes of life and so ornamental in that part of the creation where beauty seems to have fixed her peculiar feat  a long extensive and i believe i may say successful practice has enabled me to acquire the knowledge which i here pretend to communicate to the world the subject is in some degree new in this country i therefore hope for indulgence and claim no absolute merit but in my intention whatever share i may be further entitled to from the performance itself depends entirely upon the judgment of the reader to bestow and to whom i submit it without reserve  ruspini  a treatise on the teeth teeth are bones of a particular kind given by nature in order to cut break and grind the necessary aliments and to give a stronger and more articulate sound to the voice  what is chiefly to be considered in the teeth is their texture number and figure their exact order and arrangement and the time they begin to appear  in these bones we may distinguish three parts namely the body or crown of the tooth which appears out of the gums the middle comprehending the space covered by the gums and called the neck of the tooth and lastly the root that lies buried in the socket  we find in a tooth three different substances the first surrounds and covers the body or crown of the teeth it is thin but grows thicker by degrees as it draws near to the extremity of the crown this substance is so close and so hard that no impression either with a file or any other sharp instrument can be made on it but with the greatest difficulty and trouble its color is that of a pearl white peculiar to the teeth  this substance is what we call the enamel and forms itself before the tooth comes out it grows stronger and finer till the age of about  0 after which time it begins to wear off by continual use and so liable it is to decay that we often see persons of a middle age without the least enamel on their teeth such a thing very frequently happens in old men but although the enamel be lost or destroyed still the tooth is not so liable to decay as one may imagine for we find many teeth firm and sound in their internal substance notwithstanding they have been deprived of their outward coat for many years but however when once it is gone the tooth lies more exposed to the impression of heat and cold and to be acted upon by any thing acid and sharp  the loss of the enamel can never be repaired  the second substance is not so close as the former and consequently less hard it is of a dusky white color and of the same nature as that of all human bones although somewhat harder it begins immediately under the enamel in the body of the tooth and covers the neck together with the whole root  the third is that which forms the most internal part of the teeth and is called the bulb it is soft in regard to the former but pretty close if we compare it to the marrow of the other bones  the outward covering or enamel and the bony part of the tooth are not susceptible of the least sensation the reason why teeth are affected by something acid or sharp is owing to a certain tremor that communicates and as it were thrills through the nerve in the inward part if this nerve is left uncovered by a caries of the bony substance then we are tormented by the most excruciating pains  men at    and about three years after have generally    teeth    in each mandible or jaw  this number increases to    when the four teeth called dentes sapientiae appear but as these in some persons come out sooner in others later and in some never we may justly say that the true number of teeth is generally     some writers were formerly of opinion that men had    and women    but inspection may plainly evince the absurdity of this notion  all the teeth that exceed the number of    may be reckoned as supernumerary they generally push out between the incisores or fore teeth of the upper jaw and in such a case the incisores are increased in their number  these supernumerary teeth resemble very much the lateral incisores of the upper jaw  and it happens that the incisores also of the lower jaw and the molares themselves have been multiplied by intervening supernumerary teeth  teeth are generally divided into three classes viz the incisores or cutting teeth the canini or dogteeth and the molares or grinders  the incisores are eight in number four in the front of each mandible they are called incisores because their business is to cut the aliments for which purpose their outward form at the extremities is peculiarly and wonderfully adapted on the outer surface next the lips they are a little unequal and on that next the palate concave the two incisores in the middle of the upper jaw are larger and often longer than those on each side or any of the other incisores for indeed the lateral upper incisores exceed the lower in magnitude  the two middle upper incisores may be called the greater those on each side the lesser and the four of the lower mandible the small incisores these teeth describe a kind of semicircle  the canini are four in number they lie one at each side next the incisores between them and the molares both jaws  these teeth are rather longer more round and less cutting than the incisores  their use is to part things that are of a solid nature in regard to their structure they appear to be very proper not only for cutting asunder any piece of solid food but also for keeping it quite firm while one endeavors to tear and separate it as well as for gnawing bones or any thing of that kind they are called canini because they are very like to the teeth of a dog the upper canini are also known by the name of eye teeth because it was anciently believed that they had a kind of connection with the eyes and that by drawing any of them the sight was supposed to be endangered but daily experience has clearly demonstrated that such a connection and danger are merely imaginary  immediately after these come the molares or grinders they are  0 in number five on each side of both jaws  the two first in each row that is to say the nearest to the canini are the small grinders the others the large  they are so called because they are thicker blunter and more flat at their extremities than the rest they serve like so many milstones to bruise and grind the food  their figures are almost square the broad end or top of each grinder is divided into several little eminences and cavities in such a manner that when the jaws shut the eminences of the upper grinders are received into the cavities of the lower and so vice versa  we cannot help admiring with astonishment the works of providence in the figure and exact disposition of these teeth which can never be too closely examined  in order therefore to form a better idea of this admirable contrivance it will be necessary to observe that the lower jaw is a kind of a leaver resting itself at the extremity where it joins by articulation to the temporal bones the aliments are the resisting bodies and the elevatory muscles are the acting powers to overcome that resistance by raising of the jaw  the grinders which are rather blunt stand nearer the center of motion and consequently press more forcibly than the rest and this is the reason that when we would bite something remarkably hard we generally place it between the molares the canini and the incisores can never act with so much force being farther removed from the center of motion but their want of power is sufficiently compensated by their form  in speaking of the name and characteristical figure of the teeth enough has been said concerning that part of the teeth which appears out of the gums viz the crown therefore we shall proceed to their neck  of the neck of the teeth the neck is that part of the tooth covered by the gums and a bony substance which as we said before is of a dusky white color  in this neck we find in that part where it joins to the gums some little enequalities or rather wrinkles that cause some small vessels belonging to the gums to adhere more closely to the neck of the teeth by this means not only saline particles are prevented from getting into the sockets but the tooth is also rendered so firm and strong as to secure it from being shook or loosened  of the root the root is that part which is buried in the socket a continuation of the same substance and color as that of the neck it is covered by a membrane exactly similar to that which lines the socket  the root of each tooth is generally longer than the body and is thereby rendered more able to bear any strain or violent impression occasioned sometimes by chewing gnawing or breaking bodies of a hard nature  in every root we find toward the extremity a little hole which is a passage to the internal substance that is to say the bulb of the tooth  there is also a little branch of an artery a small vein and a nervous filament this hole is closed up in old age and then teeth lose their sensation various are the figures of roots and in each species of teeth there is a particular one  in all the incisores there is but one root to each tooth which decreases gradually and ends at last in a point  the canini likewise have generally but one root but there are some with two quite divided through all their extent and others only at the extremities such teeth however are very uncommon the sides of the roots of the incisores and the canini are flat and these rest upon the partition of each socket in the same manner the flat side of the contiguous tooth rests on the opposite side of the same partition which mechanism fixes more firmly these teeth in their sockets and as their necks and bodies are also flat laterally where they are applied to the other teeth thus they receive mutually a strong and considerable support by being so well adapted to each other  the small grinders namely those that come immediately after the canini on each side of both jaws have generally but one root some are found with two and some even with three but such a case is very rare the small grinders that have but one root have it always flat on the sides and therefore it supports itself in the same manner as the incisorers and the canini  the number of roots in the large molares both in the upper and lower jaw is very uncertain  there are some large grinders with one or two flat roots and each root seems to be formed of two joined together distinguished only by a kind of a little channel which begins immediately after the crown of the teeth and appears through all their extent in order to mark out the division there are in some large grinders three four and sometimes five roots quite separate from one another extending themselves in a large compass for which reason such teeth are deeply rooted and stick more closely to the socket  hence it happens that the molares are not so easily drawn out of their socket whenever the adjoining tooth is wanting  the last grinders otherwise called dentes sapientiae have fewer roots than the two teeth that precede them and their body is not so thick they have generally but two roots joined to each other which very seldom appear separate in all their extent or even at their extremities there have been some notwithstanding with three four and even five roots very plainly divided one from another but this case is not so common  the crown or body of these teeth is almost all covered by the gums sometimes the roots of the large grinders are crookedly inclined toward the internal part of the socket and sometimes toward the external some are in an undulating form and some are bent one against the other or laid across all together and therefore it is a very difficult task to draw a tooth of this kind for if ever one of these roots bends with a point quite opposite to another root that may be lodged in the little cell or the next socket then these two roots will form as it were a pair of pinchers and gripe with their extremities the bony substance that parts one cell from another and consequently in drawing a tooth with those roots we are forced either to tear the bony partition of the cells or if this should resist then either one or the other and sometimes both these crooked extremities must break and in both cases it may be of very bad consequence there is also great danger in drawing the upper molares lest you should tear with the tooth the bottom of the socket together with a very thin bony lamina or scale that parts it from a cavity called the maxillary finus for then the mucous membrane is unluckily torn and this gives occasion for inflammations and ulcers in that membrane and may even produce a cancerous ulcer as it has happened in many cases  every root has a hole that communicates with the cavity in the middle of the crown which cavity in the grinders is divided into as many small sinuses as there are little eminences on the base which is lined with a membrane that serves as a sheath to the small blood vessels and nerves that are included in the internal part of the tooth at the extremity of each root there is as we said before one or more little holes that receive nerves blood vessels and perhaps absorbent vessels which by their connection together form what we call the cord of the tooth this cord passes through the cavity of the root and conveys a proper nourishment to the substance of the tooth and as it draws nearer the crown it becomes thicker by means of the menbrane that lines the cavity  the incisores and canini have their nerves from a branch of the fifth pair called the upper maxillary which insinuates itself into the orbital canal from whence it comes out to be distributed on the face and in its way sends off filaments for all the roots of these teeth  the molares likewise receive their nerves from the same branch through small holes formed in the hinder part of the external lateral surface of the upper maxillary bone  the veins and arteries as they always join with the nerves communicate themselves the same way to the teeth these arteries are branches of the external carotids and the veins of the jugular  the nerves of the lower jaw are from another branch of the fifth pair called the inferior maxillary which enters into a canal on the inside of the angle of the lower jaw and is continued on each side to the chin a little below the roots of the teeth in passing along this bony canal the nerve sends off filaments to the roots of each of the molares and canini and is then divided into two branches one of which comes out of a hole of the bone in the chin called the mental hole to be then distributed to the chin and muscles of the under lip the other branch passes on to the symphasis of the lower jaw and is distributed to the roots of the incisores and deploe of the bone the arteries which are sent to the teeth of this mandible have their rise from the external carotid and follow precisely the course of the nerve through this bony canal and accompany it through the whole of its distribution the veins arise from the external jugular  it therefore appears from what has been saidon this subject that a tooth ach in the molares or grinders must be more exquisitely painful than in any of the other teeth for as the molares are furnished with a greater number of roots and each root having its artery vein and nerve it therefore follows that a tooth of five roots must have fifteen sensative bodies which if exposed to heat and cold by a caries of the bony matter will caeteris paribus produce a greater quantity of pain than that of a tooth with a single root  of the sockets the sockets are cavities formed in the jawbones for the receiving and fixing the teeth but these will be better understood by giving a previous idea of the mandibles in general which have so great a share in forming the countenance for if the teeth be wanting in either jaw the lower will be brought so much the nearer to the upper by the strong action of the temporal muscles as to make the chin and nose approximate one another and spoil the beauty and symmetry of the face  the mandibles may be considered as two bony arches lying parallel to eathother the lower jaw moving on its condyles and the upper which is properly composed of two bones that are firmly united before and along the palate so as to form a considerable part of that bony arch this mandible is firmly attached to the other bones of the face it has a cavity on each side directly above the roots of the grinders which is sometimes opened by drawing teeth with long roots that have pierced into it  the lower jaw is likewise composed of two bones especially in the infant state which are firmly united at the symphasis of the chin so as to make but one bone in adults this bone is remarkably hard in the lower part although somewhat spungy on its upper in order to afford a more convenient bed for the teeth this bone has no cavity save the alveolary canal which runs under the roots of the teeth and transmits to them their blood vessels and nerves  after this general idea of the structure of the mandibles we shall now treat of the sockets in particular which are cavities formed by the teeth in the diploe or spungy substance of the jaw bones divided into as many little fossulae as there are roots of each tooth these little cavities are lined with a thin elastic scaly substance not so hard as the other parts of the bone and sufficiently pliable to become a perfect mould for the teeth which in cases of violent compression or shocks gives way so as to prevent in some measure the teeth from being loosened or broke  we do not find in the jaws of infants the sockets entirely formed at least they do not appear so for there are but ten or twelve in each mandible and these not deep all the sockets in thickness are not alike for each species of teeth have their particular ones  the incisores of the upper jaw have their sockets thinner than those of other teeth and the canini theirs stronger consequently thicker than the incisores or even the small molares the first large grinder has its socket stronger than the second and last grinder  in the incisores of the lower jaw we find their sockets thinner than in all other teeth of that mandible and this is the reason that those teeth are more liable to shocks and it is likewise easier to draw them the canini have their sockets thicker than the incisores and the small grinders but the small grinders have theirs thicker than the incisores of this jaw the first large one of the molares has not the socket so thick as the second and third which last one has it thicker because of the apophysis coronoide and that is the reason why it proves generally very difficult to draw  these sockets when teeth are drawn or naturally fail are generally destroyed in a very short time insomuch that it is almost impossible to perceive any marks of them as we daily see in examining the mandibles but if ever in drawing a tooth some part of the socket was to be torn then the sides would be found not quite so thick nor so firmly joined in that place the sockets are outwardly covered and lined inwardly with a membrane or periostium common with the root of the tooth it is a continuation of the periostium that covers the other bones and of the same membrane that lines the internal part of the mouth  of the gums the fleshy part that surrounds the socket is called the gums these are made of a hard substance rather fibrous than glandulous they are penetrated and moistened by different vessels namely by veins arteries and lymphaties the texture of the gums is of a coriaceous nature with fibers interwoven like a hats felt very close and elastic of a pale vermilion color all the border of the sockets in both the inward and outward side of the jaw is covered by the gums which insinuate between all the teeth and adhere so closely to the neck of each of them that they prevent any thing acid or sharp from touching the socket before the teeth come out the gums are all of a body without the least separation and as the teeth begin to shoot out they pierce the gums and make so many holes as there are teeth in the mandible  the gums are joined to the jaws by the periostium which they every where cover the outward covering of the gums extends itself from the crown or body of the teeth over the cheeks and lips and seems in every respect to be a continuation of the same membrane  the inward gums of the upper jaw go from the internal part of the neck of the teeth as far as the circumference of the roof of the palate and those of the lower mandible as far as the circumference of the bansis of the tongue  when a tooth happens to fail the gum covers the orifice of the socket which being soon shut up or destroyed the external part of the gum joins with the internal one and they unite themselves very closely together becoming so hard and so firm a body that we see men who after having lost all their teeth bruise the aliment with their gums although they cannot cut or mince with them in this case the gums reassume the very same figure they had before the teeth appeared  the gums no doubt are the prefervers of the teeth since they keep them quite firm in their sockets and save them from being touched by any thing heterogeneous or pernicious which might produce the most painful disorders in the teeth and even a total destruction of them  the gums when properly ranged contribute very much to the ornament of the mouth for as these are of a vermilion cast and form a kind of a crescent or half moon around the enamel of each tooth they set off in a more elegant manner the whiteness of the teeth when we have occasion to show them by smiling etc of the generation of teet ii  nature in forming these bones seems to deviate entirely from those laws that she has established in the production of all other bodies and to choose a peculiar uncommon method in this generation  the greatest part of natural productions have their beginning in their roots but a tooth on the contrary does not begin to form its root till the body is perfectly finished the first substance that begins to appear in this body is not the internal part as one would imagine but the external one the farthest from the root and what is called enamel this substance in its beginning is nothing but a mucous soft paste which acquires insensibly so much firmness that it becomes at last a bony part so hard and so white that it excels all other bones as we have shown in its proper place in point of hardness and whiteness when once this scale or bony coat is formed the tooth assumes directly a proper figure and its inward part begins to be filled  the germ of the teeth like that of other bones before ossification is composed of a tissulated mucus separated and divided into a number of little cells which are afterward filled up with calcareous or bony matter and constitutes the solidity of the bone this germ is contained in little lodges or cells of the sockets which it stretches in proportion as the bulk of the tooth augments and spreads at the same time its membrane increases and takes hold of the root and forms the periostium that surrounds it  the body of the tooth being quite finished the root takes then its due form and as it grows stronger it lengthens by degrees till it becomes of a proper length the extremities grow firm and bony leaving however a free passage to the vessels that run through the cavity of its root and penetrate with their nourishing juices to the very inward body of the teeth while the root grows thicker and stronger finishing itself within the socket the body of the tooth rises toward wards the gum and attempts to come out it begins by dilating the partitions of the socket and being level with this bony border it cuts immediately the membrane in which it is enclosed then the other membrane that covers the socket and at last the gum in this manner shoots forth the teeth  the partition of the socket will lengthen in proportion as the tooth draws nearer the gum but although in lengthening they are compressed and grow stronger still they retain an elasticity by which they render the tooth safer and stronger in case any accident should befall it  the same economy we find in the molares that are furnished with more roots and consequently have more cells in their sockets which always multiply at the same time when the roots appear as was said before it would be natural to think that in those teeth that have but one root their sockets should be found greater in diameter than the root itself as the socket has taken the form and figure of the body of the tooth which is first of all formed in it and is always of a larger diameter than the root but it is never so on account of the above mentioned clastic force belonging to the partition of the sockets insomuch that as soon as the body of the tooth is out of the socket the socket contracts and adapts itself by degrees to the figure of the root holding it so close and so firm as if it were fixed in a vice or screw  of the eruption of the teeth children when they are brought into the world have generally no teeth i say generally because some have been found with two three and even four incisores two in the upper jaw and two in the lower one but these cases are not to establish a rule being only an exception  teeth appear sooner or later according to the weaker or stronger constitution of the child there have been some of them who have cut their teeth when they were two or three months old and sometimes not before they were a year or fifteen months but for the generality in the fifth sixth or eighth month after their birth the first tooth begins to appear the two small incisores of the lower jaw are the first that come out the one fifteen days after the other  the large incisores of the upper jaw appear almost at the same time then two appear in the lower jaw at the side of the former and then other two in the upper jaw this is the general order in which the incisores are seen when the child is eleven months or a year old the lower canini appear almost always at the same time and a few days after the upper canini likewise shoot forth together and these cause greater pain than the former  when children are about sixteen or twenty months old the two small lower grinders come out and in a few days after the other two of the upper jaw the other four molares do not generally appear till the child is two years old one at each side of the mandibles these make twenty in number and are called milkteeth the child remaining in this situation till about the sixth year of its age  the order we have described is not always exact for we often see the small grinders shoot forth sooner than the canini and the canini quicker than the lateral incisores at the age of five or six years the other four molares appear next to those lately come out in each mandible toward the eleventh or twelveth year four other molares come out in the same order as do likewise four others in the   th or   th which in all make    viz eight incisores or fore teeth four canini and    molares or grinders with these teeth we generally continue till the four last molares called dentes sapientiae appear the exact time of which is very uncertain though usually it happens at the age of    or even    nor are there instances wanting of their not appearing before the age of  0 when they are for the most part accompanied with tumors and fluxions on the neighboring parts which proceed from the pressure caused by the crown of the tooth on the sides of the socket and on the fleshy and membranous point of the gum which at that time of life is become more hard and obdurate at the age of seven or eight years the incisores the canini and the small molares are shed in the same order as they did appear when these are gone as many stronger and more beautiful teeth take their place  it is remarkable that if one of the milkteeth is drawn before it is loose we find in it a root as firm as that of the second tooth but on the contrary if it is drawn when it is loose there is no root at all this has given rise to a variety of opinions concerning the destination or rather destruction of the roots of the milkteeth it is imagined by some that they are entirely consumed by a flux of acid humors which absorb the calcareous matter of the roots and so decompose the constituent parts while others suppose that these roots are incorporated into the substance of the second teeth but as these suggestions are not supported by the least appearance of fact we shall not therefore take up the time of the reader to prove the contrary of them but shall only observe such an acid humor could not exist without destroying all the teeth and that such an incorporation into the substance of the second tooth has never yet been found it appears by several of the later discoveries made in anatomy that many parts necessary to the body in the embrio and infant state are totally lost and obliterated in that of adults and that those parts which are become useless and redundant in the system are absorbed and taken up the lymphatic vessels to be afterward thrown out at the different emunctories of the body that this is in reality the case with the roots of the milkteeth may be fully ascertained by a variety of similar facts that the nature of this work will not admit to enumerate  sometimes though seldom the large molares and even the dentes sapientiae will shed as happened lately to a lady who was tortured with a most exquisite pain in one of the dentes sapientiae on the right side of the lower jaw i felt the tooth quite loose which i drew with my fingers but found no root to it this i concluded to be owing to another tooth lying under it which i soon perceived on further examining of the socket as the excruciating pain still continued the lady could not be persuaded that there was another tooth to come out but that the root of the former was left behind however the appearance of the new tooth not long after fully convinced her that the pain was entirely owing to the smallness and firmness of the socket which retarded the egress of the young tooth and obliged it in a manner to grind its passage out  there is an opinion prevails that there is a very great risque in drawing milkteeth before they are loose but in reality there is not the smallest danger and indeed when they are careous or any other way painful it is absolutely necessary to draw them to prevent as much as possible an inflammation of the gums and adjoining parts which might destroy the germ of the second tooth  it is sometimes necessary to draw those teeth that lie across or ride upon one another a very disagreeable sight in order to give a more exact and uniform arrangement to the rest this defect of order in the canini and incisores in general proceeds from an extreme narrowness of the jaws but the operator must be very circumspect in examining every circumstance relative to the tooth and socket before he draws a milktooth for if a part of the socket should be broke and give way the second tooth will always come out in an irregular and ununiform manner  disorders incident to children in teething and the manner of treating them the eruption of teeth in children is often attended with the most fatal consequences by exciting fevers convulsions gripes in the intestines acidities in the stomach attended with the worst consequences and finally by introducing a great degree of irritability in their tender constitutions so that they become more liable to a greater variety of disorders  children suffer in teething first in proportion to the delicacy and sensibility of their constitutions secondly to the number and figure of their teeth that push out at the same time thirdly to the state of the gums which in some children is found to be more tense and liable to inflammation than in others  children who are originally of a delicate habit or who have been rendered so by milk of an improper quality or by any other cause that impairs their digestion and produces acidities in their stomachs and intestines are extremely liable to convulsions in teething on the contrary children of a strong robust make whose food is converted into proper nourishment are less subject to convulsive disorders but are liable often to a degree of fever which in some measure facilitates the eruption of the teeth secondly the number and figure of the teeth that shoot out at once will greatly increase the pain for the blunt flat molares will meet with a much greater resistance and a greater degree of laceration than the sharp pointed incisores or canini  at the same time the canini will prolong the pain from their wedge like figure which is continually delating the socket and gum till the tooth has completed its growth  from this great difficulty that teeth have to cut the gums a great many mischiefs are frequently produced for as inflammation is always the consequence of laceration and pressure this by going too far occasions frequently swelled glands about the throat and neck which sometimes suppurate and even ulcers in the gums and neighboring parts have been produced in order to mitigate and in some measure prevent the disorders arising from teething it will be necessary to consider well what has been already said in regard to the tendency of nature to inflammation in the strong and robust children and to convulsions gripes and looseness in the weak tender and delicate in the first case the degree of fever and inflammation may be lowered by keeping the nurse upon a low diet avoiding animal food spices or what ever tends to stimulate and increase the circulation frequent but small doses of rhubarb ought to be administered to the nurse which will gently purge the child in the safest and most commodious manner in the mean time if the gums are much swelled scarrifying them with the point of a lancet so as to make them bleed at several parts will empty the distended vessels and remove the tension from the inflamed gums and where the fever runs high even bleeding with leeches or the lancet will be of great service  in the other case where convulsions are so often the consequence we must endeavor to prevent these frightful symptoms by every method that may tend to strengthen and confirm their constitutions such as having a strong and healthy nurse taking care that she lives on the most simple and nourishing food giving the child a wholesome country air with a good deal of exercise and exhibiting small doses of aromatic infusions of the bark powder of tin or such like  where a looseness and gripes prevail it would be necessary to take every method to prevent that tendency to acidity which mostly takes place in infants whenever digestion is any way disturbed this is best done by giving frequent but small doses of the absorbent powders conjoined with aromaticks and perhaps rhubarb or more astringent simples with opiates may be found necessary  in children of relaxed habits whose gums are loose and flabby there is very little tendency to inflammation in that case applying mild astringents such as a decoction of rose buds in vinegar to the gums by the nurses finger will help greatly to brace up and facilitate the eruption of the tooth but in all cases where the symptoms are troublesome and the tooth tardy in coming out the only effectual means is to make a free exit for it by incision and to cut the gum quit down to the tooth and indeed wherever a tooth seems ready to appear and the child is pining and suffering much we ought to recur immediately to incision and in that way remove the pain that is occasioned by the distraction of such sensative parts  sometimes where the gum has been already cut and the teeth very slow in growing the parts unite and a cicatrix is formed above it here we should again cut the gum and periostium so as to lay the tooth quite bare  in some of the strong and healthy children a number of teeth will push out at the same time by which means the symptoms are greatly aggravated here also we should give a free exit by incision then gentle emollients should be applied to the gums and every thing that is irritating be avoided  particular attention should be paid to the least sore or ulcer that maybe formed about these parts lest they destroy the germ of the subsequent tooth  of the disorders of the teeth the teeth are subject to a variety of disorders which may be divided into those arising from internal or external causes the first have their rise from the juices being contaminated by scurvy scrophula venereal infection or whatever induces a cahexy of the humors  also it is observed that women are more liable to toothachs and fluxions upon the gums during the time of pregnancy than at any other perhaps from the particular sympathy of nerves that is so peculiarly shown upon the stomach etc at that period  all disorders in the gums infect the teeth and are the cause of long and painful sufferings teeth generally fail by some of the above causes  the external causes are also many the general ones are the use of aliments too hot or too cold the different impressions of air all shocks given to the teeth which affect the nerves the vapors that arise from the stomach and lungs and leave a noxious and disagreeable slime on the teeth any particles of food that stick betwixt the teeth and putrify keeping the head uncovered and exposed to the air sleeping bareheaded as likewise the excessive use of smoking and chewing tobacco the many improper remedies also that are made use of to keep the teeth clean and the caustics applied in order to mitigate the pain are always sure to destroy those they unluckily touch hence we may see of what importance it is never to make use of any remedies but what are approved of by a skilful person sugar when used immoderately is another enemy to the teeth but one of the most dreadful destroyers is mercury one ought therefore to be extremely cautious in using it all mineral exhalations are also very pernicious as we see it by daily experience in all those persons that work in any of the quicksilver lead or copper mines etc such people generally have their teeth coroded divested of their enamel and sometimes entirely wasted away by the corrosive particles exhaling from those minerals among the external causes however negligence may be reckoned the first for let the lymph be ever so pure and digestion ever so regular there are always some viscid exhalations that are apt to settle upon the teeth these can easily be removed but if neglected may prove the cause of many mischievous disorders as we shall show hereafter  it is not my intention to give my readers a list as many have done of the various disorders incident to the teeth but to comprehend them under two single articles namely erosion and caries and we shall take notice likewise of what is commonly called the tartar erosion is a disorder that renders the teeth rough and as if wormeaten  it affects only children either when the first teeth shoot forth or when the second ones appear the original causes of these disorders are the small pox the measles and all those disorders that contaminate the juices it penetrates more or less according o the hardness and firmness of the teeth and therefore if the disease should seize the child when his teeth are not sufficiently firm and ossified it must be attended with bad consequences meeting with little ressistance in the parts not sufficiently ossified  but if it should come on when the milk teeth are shedding and the new ones appear it will be of no harm to the tooth that has not as yet come out the enamel of the tooth can never be hurt but when wrapped up in its membrane as it is then nothing else but in the state of a soft mucus which being rendered acrid by the same cause the enamel will be entirely consumed whenever this disorder appears it can be of no detriment but to the parts that are not sufficiently firm and ossified children that are infected in utero with the scurvy the venereal disease etc will bring along with them the seeds of those disorders so pernicious to the teeth if proper means are not made use of to prevent it but if the original causes shall be thoroughly eradicated the milk teeth will only suffer and those that succeed them will be found quite untouched  in order to purify the constitutions of such children it will be necessary to make use of those means proper to produce a good chyle and to correct the state of the juices which is the province of the physician  it is necessary likewise to choose a good nurse whose milk is not thick for then it is not so easily assimilated by the inflantile powers nor too serous for then it wants the proper substance so necessary to form a good nutritious juice the want of which prevents bones from growing in their natural form  the child should be kept in a good and pure air and all occasions taken to give it due exercise in the arms of the nurse etc these are precautions that will prevent this disorder from affecting children it is worth observing that if the erosion happens to come after the child is wained that is to say when he is from two to six years of age a methodical way of living proper food and good air will be the means to prevent it many have thought without reason that this disorder could affect nothing but the body of the tooth and that the root was not susceptible of it it is true that the roots do not appear so rough and wormeaten as the body of the tooth but still they are shorter more crooked and of an imperfect form which they could never get but from this tendency of the humors to erosion or from the rickets which is a disease so fatal to children and proceeds from the same causes as the erosion it also proves very pernicious to the teeth and all other bones  of the caries as soon as the teeth make their appearance the caries begin to attack them and consequently they stand in need of proper assistance one should think that their hardness would render them less susceptible of it but they are even more subject to a caries than all other bones it is easy however to trace the causes of it as teeth are of a closer texture their vessels are more compressed and therefore obstructions are easier occasioned and also when cold happens to strike them to a certain degree or when the bony fibers suffer by some extraordinary effort if the juices that circulate through the small channels of the teeth are too thick or are any way vitiated the teeth will therefore be more liable to be contaminated but always in proportion to the impressions they shall receive  teeth that have been affected with the erosion at the same time they were forming are more subject to be carious on account of the bad condition of their vessels and therefore are more difficultly preserved  various are the species of caries almost every part of the teeth are affected by it and both internal and external causes produce it a caries may be divided into soft superficial deep and dry it attacks the root the neck or the crown of the teeth the caries that proceeds from internal causes namely the scurvy etc generally affects the root of the tooth often the internal surface sometimes the external and even the inward cavity of the body  such a caries is more difficult to be known than that which proceeds from external causes chiefly when it attacks the root or neck of the tooth for as the former is buried in the socket and the latter is covered by the gums one cannot perceive it and therefore we can only conjecture that there is a caries from the torturing pains that are produced but these conjectures are often false for the pain may proceed from some irritation affecting the cord of the tooth or the periostium that covers and lines the root the consquences therefore arising from this sort of caries are very bad for it is mostly necessary to draw the tooth itself  the caries that proceeds from external causes is visible and consequently by admitting of the necessary operations more easily removed a caries the longer it is allowed to run on the deeper it goes and therefore the more difficult to cure  the soft and dry caries are not dangerous if their progress is quickly and properly stopped  every kind of caries is more difficult to be eradicated according to the place it affects in the tooth as that renders the operation more or less difficult  although teeth begin to be affected with the caries as soon as they appear still it must be allowed that the time in which they are more subject to it is from    to  0 year of age  it is wroth remarking that when a tooth is affected by the caries on that side which rests on another tooth it also infects the contiguous one for experience daily shows that when the spot begins to appear in one tooth it is also seen although not so large on the next in the very same place from which we may argue that the particles exhaling from the carious tooth must be corrosive this happens not only in the lateral but also in the opposite teeth for when a caries appears on the upper surface of a tooth it is then applied to the surface of the opposite and in the same manner affects it as is particularly seen in the molares  the caries sometimes proceed from fractures in the teeth but these are generally caused by falls and from violent efforts in breaking something of a hard nature with the teeth  the fractured tooth can never be repaired but however it ought not to be neglected but carefully examined as it requires the greatest assistance of art for the tooth has sometimes in the fractured part small cutting points that will be of great detriment to the tongue and be the cause of very painful and dangerous wounds therefore they must be immediately taken off to prevent mischief to the tender parts that they touch  whenever the caries appears it must be opened by a masterly hand to the very bottom if in so doing the cord of the tooth is discovered the operation will prove very painful but still it must be destroyed either with an instrument the actual cautery or some caustic liquor  we ought to be very attentive in the operation for if we do not utterly destroy the said cord but only prick it the most raging pains will succeed together with an inflammation and the inevitable necessity of drawing the tooth  such a cure cannot but be very torturing for not only the sensitive parts of the tooth are to be exposed to the impression of the air but also to be touched with an instrument so as to be entirely destroyed the skilful operator must endeavor to assuage the pain of his patient by the assistance of medicines  when a tooth by the loss of its cord is become insensible it must be filled with lead or gold in order to prevent any acid or saline particles from getting through the hole where the cord went into the socket to hurt its delicate membranes for then there could be no means of redress but by drawing the tooth hence all the care that has been taken and all the pain that had been endured to render the tooth insensible would then be of no avail  of the tartar now we shall proceed to treat of what is commonly called the tartar from whatever occasional or secondary cause the tartar proceeds the principal one is certainly negligence it has been called by some a cancer because it corrodes the gums and the socket in suck a manner that the teeth will fall out for want of support it is generated by the fragments of aliments that stick to the teeth by a vitiated saliva or by an imperfect digestion etc  whenever this viscid matter is allowed to stick to the teeth it grows hard and becomes the tartar and it will augment by degrees from new particles of aliments continually joining the old ones but this would never happen if they were carefully cleaned every morning with something proper for that purpose  this tartar is a kind of a crust not only disagreeable to the eyes but also productive of very foetid exhalations  there are various sorts of tartar viz the yellow the whitish the black and even the green tartar which is the most pernicious as it often destroys the enamel the lower incisores are more subject to the tartar chiefly in their internal side because of their vicinity to the tongue and of the saliva which runs mostly that way although persons grown in years are generally more liable to be troubled with the tartar still we frequently see young people with their teeth all covered with it  whatever is the cause that produces this tartar or whatever the time of its appearance it ought to be removed as soon as possible otherwise the gums by the compression will swell and obstruct the regular course of the fluids through the lymphatic and blood vessels which will therefore be liable to putrify and destroy in a short time the gum the socket and periostium of the root  this is the reason why teeth grow loose and painful at that time if you were even then to cut off this heterogenous body it would be too late to hinder the loss of the tooth which is now left without any support from the gums the periostium and the socket  the tartar sometimes is even thicker than the body of the tooth to which it sticks so close that it seems to form one single body therefore requires a dextrous and skilful hand to remove it in such a case we must endeavor to render the course of the humors free again to the gums by restoring them with proper astringent and antiscorbutic medicines  some teeth after having been freed of their tartar will show a very beautiful enamel which makes it evident that such a tartar is not of an acrid or corosive nature as the green kind generally is  of the disorders the sockets are liable to the sockets are also subject to caries as well as the teeth although not so often the causes that produce such an effect in them are the very same with these formerly delivered as the internal cause of caries in the teeth  the sockets are also liable to be destroyed by degrees in the same manner as the roots of the milkteeth  this fatal disorder proceeds from a stagnation of humors in the gums where they putrify or from any sharp and corrosive particles that may penetrate and corrode them insensibly also from a stagnation of the fluids in the serous or blood vessels of the gums the sockets and their partitions will sometimes grow soft and become entirely of a fleshy consistence which therefore leaves the tooth without support old men generally lose their sockets entirely because the nutritious juices that formerly served to nourish the gums are now no longer distributed to them  it is worth observing however that persons of a robust constitution are not so liable to lose their sockets and consequently their teeth for we see people extremely old with all their teeth their gums quite perfect and therefore their sockets must be sound and well  there is no other way to prevent those disorders hut by taking a particular care in cleaning the gums never letting any corrosive particles or any viscid matter that is likely to putrify enter into the socket so that the gums may become strong and apply themselves closely round the necks of the teeth  of the disorders of the gums whenever the gums are affected they generally lose their color their firmness and consequently their adherence to the teeth they will at different times appear pale flabby relaxed rough corroded inflamed and wrinkled the lividity of the gums proceeds from some defect in the circulation of the blood through them  to remedy as much as possible so disagreeable a circumstance it will be proper to rub the gums pretty often in the morning and likewise to scarify them in order to let out some blood and in that way promote the circulation  if after these means have been used the complaint remains the same it will be the necessary to have the physicians assistance as the fault must be rooted in the constitution  the gums grow often so thick that they in some measure resemble pincushions and by communicating their swelling to the lips they will greatly deform the mouth and face  this disorder proceeds either from the compression of the tartar or a local plethora if it proceeds from the first of these the tartar must be removed immediately then scarify or prick the gums and administer proper antiscorbutic and astringent medicines fit to brace them up  but if the swelling proceeds from a plethora which is easily known a proper method must betaken to evacuate the vitiated humors and to diminish the thickness of the gums in the points that run in betwixt each tooth where the swelling more manifestly appears then proper astringents should also be applied to prevent the complaint from recurring the patient must live on a proper regimen and submit to the necessary ablutions  a swelling often as big as a strawberry sometimes appears in the gums of young people which is more unsightly than dangerous but it is necessary to discuss it as soon as possible the same causes that swell the gums will also produce excrescences upon them  if these proceed from an external cause the effect will cease when once it is removed but where the cause is internal till once that is entirely removed all outward applications will be useless sometimes these excrescences will be greater than at other times  when they begin they are never dangerous but if they are neglected and increase the tooth becomes soon loose and of course is soon lost absorbent remedies are to be applied in the beginning but when the excrescence is arrived to a certain size then it cannot be destroyed but either by carefully cutting off the redundant part of the gum or by consuming it some other way  the substance of the gums may be diminished either for want of sufficient nourishment or by being too tense and firm for then they are apt to hinder the fluids from circulating properly hence it happens that the teeth are deprived of their necessary support and the gums become a very disagreeable sight to the eye the want of juices and the contracted state of the vessels which are the chief causes may be removed by means of proper emolients etc which by relaxing the parts that were too tense and firm will promote the dilatation of the vessels and consequently the course of the humors will be more free and their quantity augmented  we must not however delay the cure too long for sometimes art comes too late the paleness of the gums proceeds from a deficiency of the globular part of the blood which may be occasioned likewise by the narrowness of the vessels it is easy by rubbing the gums pretty often to recall the blood and consequently restore to them their natural color  whenever the gums are relaxed and want that tensity and firmness which is so absolutely necessary for their being in a sound state various complaints are generally the consequence and therefore proper antiscorbutic astringents must be made use of in time to prevent and remedy such fatal disorders  the gums are sometimes rough as if spread all over with little grains like millet seeds under the skin these little tumors are hard and ugly sometimes will come to a suppuration and render the gums very painful these are therefore to be prevented by applying very strong resolvents then we must make use of detergents and come by degrees to astringents  children who eat too much sugar or sweetmeats generally have their gums corroded confectioners and chemists are subject to this disorder because the saline and corrosive particles that fly from the sugar and minerals affect their gums this disease should by no means be neglected and first of all the cause must be removed then the proper astringent and sweetning medicines must be administered to purify the mass of the blood and it is very necessary to abstain from every thing too salt spicy high seasoned or what else may render the blood acrid or sharp  the inflammation of the gums proceeds for the most part from the impression of cold air the belt remedy therefore is to keep them warm  that the gums are also subject to cancerous tumors from the above causes evidently appears and they should always be speedily extirpated such a disorder must be considered as a local affection that has proceeded from some glandular or vascular part of the gums being vitiated together with an internal or praedisposing cause in the habit it requires therefore a very serious and mature consideration before such a cure is undertaken lest we should hurry on to the operation too precipitately  sometimes ulcers will affect the gums their external causes are rotten teeth the tartar violent falls blows vitiated saliva or any other injury offered to them  the scurvy and vitiated humors are the internal causes and therefore a radical cure of the ulcers will never take place except these are entirely got the better of  they are sometimes more sometimes less deep in the gums when they are not deep astringents and antiscorbuties may be of use but when they are deep they will even produce a swelling and an excrescence in the gums and therefore we must take care to cut off the superfluity and follow the method that was mentioned when we spoke of tumors and excrescences  ulcers are of different sorts and vary greatly in their appearance but as they always proceed from the above causes and the nature of this work will not allow of prolixity it will be unnecessary to describe them  the abcesses or imposthumes that are formed in the gums proceed for the most part from some bad tooth or from some tooth not drawn in time or they may proceed from the intemperature of air from some violent blow etc as also from the extraction of a tooth difficult to draw when the cord of the tooth is left uncovered either by a caries or some other cause it swells and inflames communicating the inflammation to the periostium that covers the root and lines the socket and substance of the maxillary bones then proceeds to the socket and so to the gums where the abcess is formed from its being a much softer part we must not neglect to examine the tooth and if we find it to be the cause it must be drawn immediately even if there was a fluxion of humors upon the gums for the corrupted matters that are stagnated in that place might be very pernicious to the contiguous bony substance then we must make use of those remedies that are prescribed in such cases in order to make a perfect cure for if it was not speedily done it would prove destructive to the gums the sockets and contiguous teeth  the same causes also will produce fistulas in the gums which are more or less of a malignant nature  in order to remove them it will be proper to make use of the same things that were prescribed for the abcesses or of any thing else that the skilful practitioner will find necessary  little cancers that appear sometimes in the gums may destroyed by a caustic those that arise from some internal cause are more malignant and stubborn sometimes they are very numerous and small of color different from other cancers and almost always accompanied by ulcers somewhere else  those that proceed from the fluids being tainted by the venereal disease are distinguished from those that arise from a scorbutic humor for the former ones are deeper more painful and full of blood yielding a greater quantity of foetid matter and have their lips greatly swelled  the second ones are of a milder nature and are not so much inflamed without purifying the vitiated humors internally as was formerly hinted all outward applications will be quite useless  the gums are also subject to suppuration and in this way not only the gums may be destroyed but also the teeth i have remarked that fat persons are more subject to this disorder than those of a meagre constitution on account of their having a greater quantity of humors the fore parts of the incisores canini and small grinders toward the root are most liable to be affected with it they grow of a brownish color and in proportion as the disorder increases or decreases they assume a different appearance  suppuration frequently happens in those gums where the sockets are wanting the gum being as well as the socket divested of the periostium and consequently not able to adhere is by being left to itself and exposed to the air or filled with some little ulcers that will soon occasion suppuration and therefore it becomes necessary in order to avoid more dangerous consequences to cut off that piece of the gum which is left unattached and likewise to remove all other causes such as the surcharge of humors etc by exhibiting medicines that may be thoroughly adapted to answer that end  finis
