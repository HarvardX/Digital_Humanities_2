life to learned indolence that might be gloriously hazarded in her defense   belv smiling i shall not give you credit now for that fine flourish  this sudden ardor for the pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war  i dare swear this heroic spirit springs from the whim of some fine lady who fancied you would be a smarter fellow in a cockade and gorget than in a stiff band and perriwig   beauch if your infinuation means that my heart has not been insensible of the charms of some fair lady you are right but my transformation is owing to no whim of here is for oh charles she never yet condescended to make me the object of her thoughts   belv modest too  ay you were right to give up the law  but who pray may this exalted fairone be who never condescended   beauch i never suffer my

here is room between brother and i if cousin dick will sit closer to father   sophy lackaday  and where is the harm what do you think one has relations given one for  to be ashamed of em   pen i dont know what they were given us for but i know no young man of fashion cares for his relations   sophy more shame for your young men of fashion but i assure you brother bobby i shall never give in to any such unnatural newfangled ways as for you since lord sparkle took notice of you you are quite another thing you used to creep into the parlour when father had company hanging your head like a dead partridge steal all round the room behind their backs to get at a chair then sit down on one corner of it tying knots in your handkerchief and if anybody drank your health rise up and scrape your foot so  thank you kindly sir    pen by goles if you    shaking his fist sophy but now when you enter a room your hat is tossed carelessly on a table you pass the company with a half bend of your body

you   sophy well   pen why first of all if you should come into a drawing room and find twenty or thirty people in the circle you are not to take the least notice of any one   sophy no   pen no  the servant will perhaps give you a chair  if not slide into the nearest the conversation will not be interrupted by your entrance for they will take as little notice of you as you of them   sophy psha   pen then be sure to be equally indifferent to the comingin of others  i saw poor lady carmine one night dying with confusion for the vulgarity and illbreeding of her friend who actually rose from her chair at the entrance of the duchess of dulcet and lady betty blowze   sophy be quiet bobby   pen true as i am a young man of fashion  then you must never let your discourse go beyond one word  if any body should happen to take the trouble to entertain the company you may throw in  charming  odious  capital  never mount to a phrase unless to that dear delightful one of all that sort of thing  the use made of that is wonderful  all that sort of thing is an apology for want of wit it is a substitute for argument it will serve for the point of a story or the fate of a battle   sophy well then  upon going away   pen oh you go away as you came in  if one has a mind to give the lady of the house a nod nodding one may but it is still higher breeding to leave her with as little ceremony as i do
