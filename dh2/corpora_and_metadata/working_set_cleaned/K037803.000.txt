altered from shakespeare in the year    0  by theo cibber  heu quantum potuit caeli pelagique parari hoc quem civiles fuderunt sanguine dextrae lucan london printed for j walthoe jun in cornhill w chetwood in russel street covent garden and j stagg in westminster hall and sold by j roberts in warwick lane price   s   d  preface this piece was finished above two years ago and put into my hands to make what use of it i thought fit and though it cost our author but the labor of a single month or less yet upon this occasion i cannot but think the publishing it will oblige the world since it is a sequel to mr philips s play of duke humfrey and an introduction to mr cibbers alteration of richard the third never child had a more regardless father than the parent of this and therefore rather than have it smothered i thought it a more human act to let it come upon the parish and in my poor opinion i have seen a less promising appearance than this brat carries about him rise in the state  but if like phaeton in shakespeares carr the unequal muse unhappily should err at least you will own from glorious heights he fell and there is some merit in attempting well prol to ximena the persons

tears of joy for i am crushed between two mighty joys your royal safety and my sons success  enter young clifford and kneels k hen o gallant clifford how shall i reward thee  y cliff i fought not for

duke of york is newly come from ireland and with a puissant and mighty power is marching hitherwards in proud array  k hen true he approaches with a mighty host but he gives out he only does intend to drive away from me some wicked ministers  y cliff the constant vizard of rebellion rebellion is so foul and grim a monster that those who mount the horrid beast are forced to cover it all over with

rocks and fight with flint i am so angry at these abject terms and now like frantic ajax on sheep or oxen could i spend my fury i am far better born than is the king more like a king more kingly in my thoughts but i must make fair weather yet a while till henry be more weak and i more strong aside o cumberland i prithee pardon me that i have given no answer all this while my mind was troubled with deep melancholy the cause why i have brought this army hither is to remove proud somerset from the king seditious to his grace and to the state  o cliff that is too much presumption on thy part but if

wept the ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks a napkin steeped in the harmless blood of sweet young rutland by rough clifford slain and after many scorns many foul taunts they took his head and on the gates of york they set the same and there it does remain the saddest spectacle that ever was viewed  edw oh clifford flinty clifford thou have cropd the flower of europe for his chivalry and

full gently on his warlike queen that robbed my soldiers of their heated spleen or whether twas report of her success or more than common fear of cliffords vigor who thunders to his captives blood and death i cannot judge but to conclude with truth their weapons like to lightning came and went our soldiers like the nightowls lazy flight or like a lazy thrasher with his flail fell gently down as if they struck their friends i cheered em up with justice of our cause with promise of high pay and great reward but all in vain they had no heart to fight and we in them no hope to win the day so that

they lacked tears i could supply em how will the kingdom for these woeful chances misthink the king and not be satisfied oh wretched men how are ye all deceived who think there is no true joy but in a crown by my life it is the very height of misery natures common benefits we want our sleep unsound and short and all our needs to be supplied with fear since treachery lurks in each corner of a cursed court how often is a monarch stung to death by the deadly viper which his bosom warmed how do we rack our brain with thoughts for others who nothing think for us yet how are men gulled with the deceitful bait of pomp and show mere gaudy pagentry to varnish over a wild distracted state now by my royalty and pompous woe a prisons preferable to a court there though confined i could enjoy my mind at liberty soar to the high orbs of heaven and gain a kingdom of immortal joy while others toiling for a nations good shall lose themselves alas did my son know the trouble of a crown he would cease to wonder why i should resign it and join in prayers for heaven to take it from me oh wretched men who in these wars have lost your dearest friends and now are weeping for em here is a king more woeful than you all you grieve but for your selves i for you all oh you who when you suffer by your kings think to mend all by war and by rebellion see here your sad mistakes how dreadfully you

gentle air and what makes robbers bold but too much lenity bootless are plaints and cureless are my wounds no way to fly nor strength to hold out flight the foe is merciless and will not pity for at

lopped the branch in hewing rutland when his leaves put forth but set his murdering knife unto the root from whence that tender spray did sweetly spring i mean our princely father duke of york  edw bring forth that fatal screchowl to our house that nothing sung but death to us and ours now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound and his illboding tongue no more shall speak  war i think his understanding is bereft say clifford do thou know who speaks to thee dark cloudy death oershades his beams of life and he nor sees nor hears us what we say since then he is dead off with the traytors head and rear it in the place your fathers stands and now to london with triumphant march there to be crowned englands royal king from hence shall warwick cut the sea to france and ask the lady bona

albans battle lost his life in the defense of him we thought our king if my poor husbands loyalty did err he dearly for that fatal error paid my humble prayer is that my poor orphans may not be punished for their fathers faults if erring loyalty can be a fault  edw i never had eyes or my eyes never saw beauty till this amazing minute  rich so he is lost and any one may have england now that will  l g may it please your highness to resolve me now and what your pleasure is shall satisfy me  rich ay widow then i will warrant you all your lands if that which pleases him shall pleasure you  edw i am so rappd i mind not what she says nor that she is all this while upon her knees pray madam rise  leave us  rich yea is it so i see the lady has a thing to grant before the king will grant her humble suit  edw if i forget not you said you had a husband who in st albans battle lost his life  l g yes sir i had his name was sir john gray  edw what excellence had he above mankind that he should be more blessed than all the rest how many children have you lady tell me  geo i think he means to beg a child of her  rich nay then hang me he will rather give her two  l g three my most gracious lord  rich you shall have four if you will be ruled by him  edw oh wondrous happy man to enjoy this woman i must enquire about her i was never never so charmed before  my lord come hither pray do you know this lady  lord yes sir well she is the widow of the late sir john gray a man of noble blood and great estate but a most vehement lancastrian  edw no matter of what family is she  lord her quality does far exceed her husbands and yet her virtue does exceed her quality she is the daughter of sir richard woodvil her mother was sometime duchess of bedford and daughter of the earl of st pool  edw of noble birth and by her mothers side related to the house of lancaster  lord she is by marriage sir that was the cause that sir john gray was such a fierce lancastrian  edw she has beauty virtue joined with noble birth why may not this fair lady be a queen but she is a subject england will not like it and the english nation like the sea it governs is bold and turbulent and easily moved and always beats against the shore that bounds it what are the people free and not the king not free where every slave is free his bed ay so it is it seems and the english fury will easily with any wind be raised to dash the palaces and peace of kings come what will come this lady shall be mine she shall be or my mistress or my wife what was it madam you desired of me  l g to give poor orphans sir their fathers lands  edw heaven forbid i should retain em from em  l g then sir with humble thanks i take my leave  edw hold madam for i must have one word more pray tell me madam do you love your children  l g more dearly sir than i do love my self  edw and would you not do much to do them good  l g to do them good i would sustain much harm  edw i must impose a tax upon this land  l g it shall be thankfully and gladly paid  edw it will i am sure more gladly be received it is an easy tax no more but love  l g no loyal subject sir but loves their king  edw but this is love that none but you can grant  l g i do not understand your meaning sir  edw truly i scarcely understand my self for i have gazed my self out of my reason  l g with your permission sir i take my leave  edw oh you shall never never part from me  l g alas what mean you sir  edw i mean all the love ever was or can be in the heart of man  l g oh royal sir i dare not understand you because i dare not think ill of my prince  edw can there be ill in love there will be all the happiness to me glory to you your heart and mine can possibly desire why do you tremble and draw back your hand you must not shall not stir till you have granted what all this languishing and pressing mean  l g oh i shall swoon would i had never come here sir i thus low most humbly beg of you let it suffice your conquering arms have seized my husbands life your laws have seized his lands seek not to take my honor and my virtue i never fought against you never opposed you  edw her looks do argue her repleat with modesty her words do show her sense incomparable all her perfections challenge sovereignty i wrong her therefore she deserves a crown and each look claims a kingdom as its due madam i mean nothing but honor to you i am resolved to make you queen of england  l g now sir you mean dishonor to your self i am as much unworthy to be queen as i am above serving an ill design  edw rather the crowns unworthy of your beauty  l g it is impossible you should descend to such mean thoughts  edw it is impossible i should have happiness without your love i had rather with your love be your dead husband than with your hatred be a living king therefore consider well what you will do think on the extravagance of my passion think how very great or miserable my power can make you and remember too you said you were fond of all your children and that to do them good you could bear harm and now behold a king who courts both you and them to wealth pomp and royal greatness  l g heaven instruct me what answer i shall make who knows how far his passion backed with power may hurry him to ruin me and mine if i should not consent unto his will i by denial ruin our whole house when i by yielding bear the storm alone i rather will consent to sacrifice my self than see my poor little orphans reduced to shame to want and beggary that thought strikes more poniards into my heart than my consenting unto edwards love oh that i only were concerned in this aside i lately wished i never had come here for my own sake i wish it now for yours oh think sir what will all your subjects say  edw they will say i am in love  l g but will they not be much displeased their prince should love so low  edw i give them leave to choose where they like best and shall i be the only man imposed on  l g but you have sent to court a foreign princess may bring your kingdom great advantages consider how you may enrage lord warwick  edw he is my friend and subject not my master  l g i fear the world will much condemn you sir  edw i care not

have i fought only to give you joys what must not i too have an equal share i have my passions sir as well as you whence do those passions spring from childish love no from manly greatness all other fondness i have banished from this rude tough breast of mine for i am not made to please a wanton eye then what will satisfy my appetite naught but a crown it hangs within my sight and i will stretch this blasted arm of mine over all the heads that are twixt me and that but i will reach it  my arm must then be long for say that edwards titles buried still there remains clarence and henry and his son edward with their unlooked for issue to take their rooms ever i can place my self a cold premeditation for my purpose why then do i but dream on sovereignty like one that stands upon a promontory and spies afar off shore which he would tread wishing his foot were equal with his eye and chides the sea that sunders him from thence saying he will lave it dry to have his way so flatter i my self with things impossible how rarely would the long regal robe hide my deformity of back and legs how would a scepter grace this shrunk up arm and oh what beauty is there in a crown and till i gain it i do live in torment shall i then stand like one lost in a wood and rather bear the pricking of the thorns than stain my sword by hewing out my way why do i not set this brain of mine to work and frame my countenance to all occasions i will play the orator as well as nestor deceive more slyly than ulysses could and like a sinon take another troy i can add colors to the camelion and for advantage can change shapes with proteus have i endured all hazards of the war only to see this lustful edward reign have both my hands for him been washed in blood  and shall they not dare do the same for me soft time and cunning and a daring mind shall set this wished for crown upon my head some men perhaps will say by villainy that is villainy which by its ill success betrays a man and into ruin throws when once it gains a crown it virtue grows  the end of the third act act iv scene i enter warwick with a letter edward it is well i do deserve this from thee for being such an ass to fight for one who

death did i impale thee with the regal crown and put king henry from his native right and is it thus thou recompencst my deeds my injured honor rouses up my rage am i rewarded at the last with shame then to repair my honor lost for thee i will renounce thee and return to henry so noble margaret former grudges pass henceforth i will be her faithful servitor and i will plant henry in his former state when i departed from this treacherous edward matters of marriage was the charge he gave me but dreadful war shall answer his demand had he none else to make a se but me then none but i shall

a simple guard we may surprise and take him at our pleasure our scouts have found the adventure very easy that as ulysses and stout diomede with slight and manhood stole to rhesus tents and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds so we well covered with the nights black mantle at unawares may beat down edwards guard and seize his person but none attempt his life you that will follow me to this attempt applaud the name of henry with your leader shout why then let us on our way in silent sort for henry and his friends heaven and st george exeunt enter guards   come on my masters each man

suppressed    but say i pray what nobleman is that that with the king here rests in his tent    it is the lord hastings the kings chiefest friend    oh is it so  but why commands the king that his chief followers lodge in towns about him while he himself keeps in the cold field    it is the more honor because the more danger    ay but give me worship and quietness i like it better than a dangerous honor if warwick knew in what estate he stands it is to be doubted he would waken him    unless our halbards did shut up his passage    ay wherefore else guard we this royal tent but to defend his person from night foes  enter warwick with soldiers war this is his tent and see where stands his guard courage my masters honor now or never but follow me and edward shall be ours    who

manent prince and anne oh my beauteous anne the battle bids me leave thee for a while but flushed with conquest soon i will return and lay my dear bought laurels at thy feet by heaven i think i could persuade my father to resign his crown for ever to proud york so i might rest within thy lovely fold secure of peace and undisturbed by war but that the thoughts of making thee a queen awakes my soul and summons it to arms yet if i fall which gracious heaven forbid for now methinks i am even fond of life having tasted of the bliss of thy sweet love though i before thought of it as a trifle the loss of life seems but of little moment when i reflect upon the loss of thee and when the horrid thought comes in my mind i leave behind my souls dearest treasure for other happy men perhaps to enjoy then sweet i beg of thee this once to swear thou never wilt have thought of other man  l a why my dear lord do you then doubt my truth  prince oh no by heaven  but i would have my ear blessed with the music of thy melting voice in words of comfort ever i do depart that if the almighty powers gracious will is so determined i must fall in battle i may have hopes our spotless souls through love and constancy may meet in heaven hereafter and spite of war we may again be happy  l a then hear me gracious heaven and assist me to keep the vow i solemnly do make if it seems sitting in the eye of heaven my precious edward in this war should fall may heaven forsake me at my latest hour if i ever taste of joy or comfort more and if my heart should ever swerve from truth may all the bitter pangs of a racked conscience pursue me here and in the world to come and oh ye mighty guardians of the just protect his youth in the deadly brunt of war and send my yew home adorned in triumph edward my love be careful of thy life for if thou dyst thy loving anne falls with thee  prince this is too much for mortal to support how shall i bear this vast excess of bliss surely i cannot have long time to live my joys flow in so fast this present hour but let fate do its worst this pays for all oh my hearts joy if edward ever prove false may heaven inflict its deadliest vengeance on me hark my love trumpets sound the cheerful trumpet calls me to the field my heart even dances to its spritely notes this one embrace and then farewell my anne adieu thou dearest thou excelling creature now i am certain fate it self cannot part us let death stand in its worst form arrayed i will not entertain a thought of fear but warmed by thee my life bravely i will on to assert my lawful title to the crown by this days feats in battle i will prove what youth dare do for empire and for love exit enter lady elizabeth l e oh anne now show thy self a loving sister and send elizabeth supply of tears for mine will never suffice for my great sorrow  l a alas from whence proceeds this sudden grief  l e is not our father warwick gone to fight against king edward and my husband clarence and can thou ask the occasion of these tears let who will conquer still thy sister mourns or for her murdered father or her husband  l a why let his treason wipe away his love  l e oh he is too deeply rooted in my heart be witness heaven i had never loved him had not my noble father first commanded i plainly saw when he did leave king edward it was his love for me did prompt him on why have i not the power to keep him here oh now he has got possession of my person he like a tyrant gives his will free way my father does command that i should hate him i out of duty to my worthy father would hate him much but that my heart pleads hard and will not turn him forth from out my bosom  l a why then indulge thy sorrows dear eliza for i will be thy very faithful friend and send forth sigh for sigh and tear for tear thy state indeed deserves extremest pity since thy great sorrow is past hope of cure unless the saints in pity to thy woes should send some miracle to end thy grief  l e the only way to prove thy self my friend is to contrive how to increase my sorrow for when i find that it is in human nature to suffer more it may avail a little to stop the torrent of my flowing tears but i am sure that is impossible whenever i strive to press a rising sigh my heart even bursts to give it a free passage  l a let them have scope though what they do import help nothing else yet do they ease the heart exit

my poor words can  prince methinks a woman of this valiant spirit should if a coward heard her speak these words infuse his breast with magnanimity and make him naked foil a man at arms i speak not this as doubting any here for did i but suspect a fearful man he should have leave to go away betimes lest in our need he might infect another and make him of base spirit like himself if any such be here which heaven forbid let him depart before we need his help  war women and children of so high a courage and warriors faint why twere perpetual shame oh brave young prince  thy famous grandfather
