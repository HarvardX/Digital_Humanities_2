a rural ramble to which is annexed a poetical tagg or brighthelmstone guide by g s carey  terry sculp paternoster row    london printed for r thomas brighthelmstone and sold by r baldwin paternoster row london mdcclxxvii  apology as the following trifle is the mere recital of a rural ramble when i had not time to wander from the strait and common road i hope the reader will excuse my not entering more particularly into the origin of customs or date of antiquities those have already been given the world by more profound and indefatigable pens than mine  all that i have attempted is simple incident and if it should not be found altogether suited to the mind from the matter yet i flatter myself i have in some measure written to time and mode as very few of our fashionable readers would wish to have the contents of a volume outlast the dresg of their hair or the common post of a chaise and four  rural ramble walking with a friend from the busy exchange to the forlorn st jamess when the sun shot down his hottest rays and the fainting porter groaned beneath his load i observed that london always wore the most unpleasing aspect at the most pleasing season of the year it was july and the gay and fashionable part of the world was gone to more fashionable or more retired resorts  town was half deserted a liberal face was rarely to be met the smart and smirking shopkeeper whose hands but a month ago were well employed in measuring out his different commodities now stood at his door with his hands tucked up behind him his customers fell in like donations to a charity slow but well received  the different avenues sent up their unsavory odours from their different confines and as the heat increased the thicker were the rising exhalations we mutually wished to be in the country we challenged each other with a ramble stepped into a tavern eat a good dinner settled the proposals over a bottle of wine and put our wishes into action  we agreed to walk or ride as it might suit us for the slower we were in our paces the more explicit in our observations we went home packed up our different necessaries and sent them off by the tunbridge machine we left town about five of clock in the afternoon took with us a faithful favorite dog to guard and to amuse us and walked through a perpetual cloud of dust and throng to greenwich but turning on our way to lewisham we took our leave on it the trees and hedges now were greener the country stiller and contemplation began to fill the mind  we saunterd on and bent our way to bromley enjoying an uninterrupted conversation save that now and then some view some house or object broke the thread of our discourse and would often beguile us into a pleasing observation  about nine we entered bromley the evening was breaking in apace but turning round we found there was yet light enough to view the great metropolis we just had left behind st pauls whose towering dome seemed to kiss the clouds was half encircled in a bed of smoke the busy bustle of the noisy city that but a few hours before almost distracted us now was heard no more and we pleased ourselves with the reflection that we had already set the greatest and the wealthiest city in the world at so great a distance in so short a time  when we had reached our inn were shown into a room and placed ourselves in separate chairs we found that if we had been necessitated to have gone farther we should have been tired we ordered a good supper eat with a good appetite went to our beds slept sound and waked in the morning without the headache  in the morning we arose early the sun shone forth in all his splendour and while our breakfasts were preparing we sought the churchyard and wandered through the tombs here and there an uncouth epitaph was cut perhaps the rude production of the clerk or sexton here we found but little worth our observation either from its oddity sentiment or wit but turning to take a survey of the country round us st pauls again stood in our way and morning fires sent up clouds of smoke which seemed to make their way for many miles yonder said i is the greatest capital in the world there many a head is aching with its cares there many a heart is breaking with its sorrows some full of age and avarice cleaving to fortune like ivy to the oak scraping up with greedy anxiety massy heaps of gold to make them masters and to bear a transient sway over statemansions and extensive plains let them come here and see how little how small a spot must soon suffice here stands a tomb that tells a wealthy merchant lies within and here are too engraved the honors that he once possessed mark the characters of his life epitaph he was industrious to his cost he never a single hour lost to serve a friend or say a prayer his business so engrossed his care in spring of age in highth of pride his cares oercame him and he died   the scripture tells us there is a time for every thing but this unfortunate man seems to have been possessed of a different way of thinking he wanted to be rich and thought his time was only given him to that end he saw the golden mammon in his view and ran himself out of breath in striding forth too hastily to his throne  but says my friend that never shall be the case with me i am rich with a competency i am happy riches cannot purchase more perhaps the mouldering course that lays within this costly tomb never spent an hour in pleasing reflection like this we now enjoy never viewed the beauties of the painted meads or strayed the plains to taste the bliss of health or charms of social conversation but he has stolen into the grave with a dull and sordid mind that never would let him look up to the sun we left this consecrated close of meditation and sought our inn eat our breakfast and made our way to seven oaks  the country was beautifully variegated with hanging woods that seemed to fringe the skirts of every hill the valleys fertile and were plentifully scattered over with flocks and herds from every rood we made on either hand we acquired some new object  about fourteen miles from london we discovered a remarkable well very wide deep and the water peerless it was near the common road and seemed to have been dug as a common convenience to every needy thirsty traveller that might chance to pass that way near it sat on the trunk of a bulky elm just felled and lopped of all its branches one who had just refreshed himself from the cooling spring by dipping in one corner of his hat and drinking from the other we accosted him with enquiries he made replies with civility we found him more intelligent than we had reason to expect he said he lived in the neighborhood was an old inhabitant and told us he had been informed that the well we so much admired was dug by the romans for the use of one part of their army that once was stationed near that spot he then bid us observe a range of lofty trees at some distance planted in the form of a crescent those he told us were reared to perpetuate the situation in which their tents were said to have been ranged and that thereabout was said to have been fixed the standard of one of their generals but he honestly acknowledged he could not remember his name said he was fond of reading had read much but he was old and his memory left him with his hairs  we were pleased with his conversation thanked him for the little piece of history he furnished us with bid him a good morning and made the best of our way to riverhead where we no sooner wished to rest than we found ourselves invited by a whimsical illiterate triplet written under the sign of the maidenhead gemmen if you have any pray stop and spend one penny with poor tom lemmy   the house is lowly has a thatched roof yet it is pleasantly situated on a rising ground about sixty paces from the road the walls were built of clay the landlord humble and seems to place his dependence on cottage customers or frugal country travelers we paid our attention to the invitation on his sign asked what he sold he told us ale of his own brewing and challenged the whole parish in respect to its good body and sound qualities he sometimes made an effort at a joke therefore we put him on his mettle chafed him with rugged questions but we found from his replies he was composed of so soft a texture that the coalition of his retorts with our simple interrogatives could not produce one spark of wit then we sat us down upon a bench under a spreading tree that shades his house tasted of his ale which was very good we praised it but soon discovered that though he had not much to boast of in respect of wit he had more of cunning for he advised us to have a second tankard which we refused what says he not any more why can you have too much of a good thing at which saying he was so pleased with himself that he laughed immoderately we told him we had drank ale enough had swallowed too many bad jokes and that when we might happen to come that way again we would thank him for his ale but he might keep his wit for other company this we found in some measure ruffled the poor old man so to show we did not mean to wage a war of words we shook hands and parted  we arrived at sevenoaks about noon where we dined took a survey of the ancient seat of his grace the duke of dorset the park is beautifully variegated with lakes and clamps of lofty trees in different parts very judiciously disposed the house has a venerable and magnificent appearance but we had not an opportunity to see the interior excellences the road for some miles is made uncommonly pleasant by the embowering trees that shelter it from the sun sometimes from side to side they form a lofty arch and then a break present itself and shows the house in a different point of view furnishing the traveller with a pleasing variety of scenes  we had walked almost to tunbridge town i believe it might have been at three miles distance a guidepost was fixed at the corner of a lane telling us it was a road to tunbridgewells but we soon found that it was a road that led us four or five miles out of our way however we arrived at a village about two miles out of the great high road it was pleasant very retired the inhabitants were exceeding rustic and civil there was a beautiful old church a neat and decent place of entertainment the sun was near his setting and the cricketers were at play upon a smooth and level green the clack of the mill and the sign at the public house brought to my remembrance the old ballad  at the sign of the horse near the foot of the hill   we refreshed ourselves here and got instructed in our way to tunbridge the sun was now gone down it was about five miles we had to go through the most delightful meadows the river was our guide on the banks of which we walked and found out tunbridge as queen eleanor did her way through the meandering bower by a clue of thread so we by the winding stream  the stars began to twinkle the reedsparrows sung upon the willows at length the moon broke gravely through the clouds and glimmered in the gliding stream  when we arrived at the town of tunbridge we gave a good lookout for the best inn we fixed upon one that wore the best external appearance but as to the entertainment within i believe i shall not be tempted to visit it any more we ordered supper and out of many things we hardly found one that was fit to eat the wine so bad that we contented ourselves with making it into humble negus and improved it with lemon water and sugar our bed rooms dirty as were our sheets our beds were hard in the morning when we had eat a breakfast composed of rank butter coarse sugar and illflavoured tea the hostess made a good conclusion by bringing in a long and extravagant bill which brought to our minds what moody says in the jubilee of shakespeare we had nothing to eat and paid double for that too  we sat off in the morning for the wells which are five miles from the town which we had no sooner left than we found we had gradually to ascend the road to the top of a hill for near two miles which was richly fertilized with corn wood and pasture from the summit of which we had a most extensive prospect through most parts of kent part of surry and sussex the view was beautifully ornamented with different seats surrounded with parks villages churches with their taper spires and glassy rivers glistening in their valleys walking on a few miles farther through such a country as i have described we reached the gay romantic tunbridge wells  they are in a bottom surrounded by hills or mounts mount ephraim mount sion mount misery etc from the pumproom runs a terras of near a thousand feet on which is built a light and airy piazza that the gentry in rainy weather may walk and talk without being wet under the piazza are ranged all kind of shops booksellers confectioners milleners fruiterers apothecaries tunbridge wares etc there are two sets of public rooms very handsome and convenient pinchbecks and frys likewise an orchestra erected in the center of the place in which there is a tolerable band of music employed to play while the company are upon the walks there seems to be a greater harmony in this than any other wateringplace i know perhaps this may proceed from its being more compact that the company are brought more together than at any other place or that the master of the ceremonies is a more sensible man or that he has less of a coxcomb about him than some i could mention who would wade through thick or thin to get to a gaming table instead of attending to their company or their friends whatever it may proceed from it is most certainly one of the pleasantest and most agreeable places of its kind there are two good inns one i never visited but that which i made my quarters the angel had the most gentlemanlike civil host i ever met with  the lodginghouses are whimsically seattered round the hills some on a declivity which open to the village with a pleasing slope each house has its grove or garden annexed to it several personages of distinction make this their summer residence having distinct and elegant villas of their own  about a mile from the wells there are a range of rocks fantastically ranged when you stand in the valley below them they represent a fleet of stately men of war all abreast bearing down upon the spectator the tops of them are decorated with beautiful shrubs and from out the different crannies shoot the birch and beach from the summit of some stands towering a stately elm which with the assistance of a little fancy may be often thought to bear a good resemblance of a mast and the spreading branches hang like the furled shrouds they are mostly separated by different isles or avenues in some places they represent the ruins of an old cathedral as we were passing through one of the avenues we discovered the following inscription well chiselled out upon one side of the rock dated near an hundred years ago inscription stop passenger and read beneath thy feet five fathom low lies here entombed a beauteous beau he from the rocks dread summit fell strike with thy stick and ring his knell   we instantly struck our canes against the sides of the rock and whether it was from the drossy nature of the stone or from its reverberating from some particular cell we could not determine however it produced a sound similar to that of a bell we climbed to the top and took a full survey of one of the most beautiful and romantic valleys we ever saw the flocks were making to their fold the moon was rising majestically on the left and a faint glimmering of the lamps at tunbridge wells were seen upon our right it was an assembly night and we could sometimes hear the buzzing of the gay beau monde hurrying to their revels the contrasted scenes urged me to reflection and placing myself on the root of an old tree near the corner of a rock i pencilled down the following stanzas  i ye that groan beneath the weight of dissipation pride and state condemned to walk through lifes parade at rout or drum or masquerade ye that fain would pleasure find led by fortune ever blind come and sit along with me come and taste tranquillity ii or if chased by sallow care would you shun the hag despair would you cheerful health restore  when advice can do no more seek the fresh reviving breeze or the fanning of the trees come and sit along with me come and taste tranquillity iii ye that feel the pangs of love come and murmur with the dove shun the false ungrateful maid seek the sweet sequestered shade let her never behold thy tears leave her  time the passion wears come and sit along with me come and taste tranquillity iv ye that languish to regain a breaking heart or racking brain drove by fortune or by fate to a wild and frantic state or moping wander like a loon dreading often the wayward moon come and sit along with me come and taste tranquillity we took our leave of tunbridge wells but had previously made enquiry of a farmer whom we met plodding near the rocks the preceding day what accomodations he thought we might meet with at boarsheadstreet a straggling village five miles from the wells and in our road to brighthelmstone he told us there was a maen good house called the boarshead and gave us to understand the man who kept it was a friend of his and would use us well if we made use of his name we thanked him and rested confidently on his information the weather was warm so purposed getting there between tea and supper to avoid in some measure the expense of lodging at the wells for beds are dear very dear at this place accordingly we sat out enjoying the sweet serenity of the evening and arrived at this seemingly deserted village about nine oclock comforting ourselves that we had made an end of our journey then enquired for the boarshead which we according to the farmers tale supposed a tolerable inn but to our mutual mortification found it nothing but a humble pot house and the landlord and his wife for want of custom were gone to bed however we were determined not to be too precipitately prejudiced by external appearances which is too generally the case so knocked at the door for our predicament made us flatter ourselves it might be better than it seemed as soon as we were heard we were questioned by a female with a ragged head peeping through as ragged a casement with who is there we told our business she replied ifegs we have got no beds then said we have you no wine no ifegs we have no commendation for gemmen we asked her where we might expect to be accommodated oh sir a little farther there is a desperate good house called crowberry gate we asked her how far she might suppose it was to crowborough gate she replied only four miles we with an emphasis of admiration as well as mortification cried only four miles no indeed gemmen ifegs it is no more as we had no other alternative than pursuing our journey we gulped the disappointment like a bitter bolus and made the best of our way to crowborough gate though not without some fears and from different causes the one that we might chance to miss our way and the other that we might happen to be stopped upon the way but the evening being very favorable after crossing an extensive heath such a one on which one might conceive macbeth held converse with the witches we reached crowborough gate it is a lonely house all were fast asleep within we had no one to ask whether it was the house to which we had been directed or not but looking at the sign which we with difficulty distinguished was a crow and a gate the crow was represented sitting on the top then making to the house which we feared at first was uninhabited perceived a label on the door on which was written london porter sold here we knocked but it was a long time before we could raise the soporific landlord at length a window was thrown up at which a head appeared with a topping like a buffalo and voice like a bear or caliban crying who is at the door we told him we were benighted were tired and should be glad of something to eat and a bed to rest ourselves that may be he cried but i dont think it worth my while to let you in we importuned him much but found him obdurate then asked him what county we were in to which he replied sussex and a very good county too we were sorry he had given us so bad a specimen of it however we desired him to acquaint us where there was any likelihood of getting proper entertainment where said he why at the uckfield which he gave us to understand was five miles farther there you may chance to get in they are up there all hours so i wish you a good night  this staggered our philosophy as our exercise had not only made us heartily wish to rest but had begot an appetite we wished to gratify this said my friend is one of the many vicissitudes travelers often experience let us comfort ourselves with one consolation which many in our present situation are not furnished with though we have met with the want of humanity we are not also in want of money that and daylight will bring us to some haven the first will urge the industrious to open their doors and the latter the most sordid to open their hearts  when we had with weary paces plodded about a mile from this inhospitable dwelling the road though it was night was still made darker by the gloomy curtain of a wood  there was a friendly style at the entrance of an avenue that seemingly meandered through the solemn shades here we sat and rested for a while the fluttering bat flew wantonly around our heads the cricket sung the owl hooted to his fellow sage yet all contributed to form a pleasing awful scene here similar to the time we quoted many a favorite verse from shakespeare milton dryden of our immortal bards of old  there was a cottage opposite to where we sat the silence of the night was broke by the whimsical controversy of its inhabitants we could easily distinguish what they said and drawing nearer to the door we found it was a curious curtain lecture which a woman was delivering to her drowsy husband she evidently discovered a perturbed spirit her husbands conduct the preceding day would not let her rest for this was partly the discourse  ah you can sleep wellenough and be hanged to you a fine days work you have made on it indeed you have brought your pigs to a fine market sold only one poor sack of wheat and spent half the money by the way to which the husband replied rather vociferously what the devil is the woman mad can one have no rest for you night nor day i never brought my pigs to so bad a market as when i married you these words were but throwing spirits on the fire reproach was answered by reproach and as the weakest always falls to the ground the wife was tumbled out of bed this raised the rest of the family who with a friendly interference convinced them they were both in the wrong and after some little wailing of the wife the husband was softened into pity they kissed and made it up and we pursued our journey when we reached uckfield we were so tired that we were determined to go no further as we entered the town the church clock struck one this directly brought to our fancy the first two lines in youngs night thoughts  the clock strikes one  we take no note of time but from its loss   all seemed folded up in sleep and silence anon a cheering candle from a garret window shot its feeble rays and much attracted our attention and lest it should unfortunately have been extinguished before we reached the house in which it was we made the best of our way twas at the sign of the maidenhead we knocked and was immediately answered by a mild angelic voice from above we asked if we could be furnished with a supper and a bed yes replied the damsel i will go to my mistress directly for the key no cry of a reprieve to a despairing criminal could have been received with greater welcome presently a murmuring we heard in her mistresss chamber and from her long delay of bringing down the key we feared some obstacle was raised by fate still to exercise our patience and our conjectures were too directly verified our little bird of hope returned but sang a different strain gentlemen i am very sorry sorry indeed but my mistress says she will let in none tonight here i broke out into heroics tell your mistress then she is inhuman we will go no farther we are tired hungry and benighted my poor dog too is footsore and still more hungry than ourselves he shall be my pillow and here we will stay till morning this had some effect for we were desired to stay for a moment the hostess was about revoking of her sentence but first the hostler was sent out to reconnoitre his instructions we plainly could conceive were to notice our address and our attire he saluted us with pity the most contemptible specimen of friendship then admired the beauty and nobility of our dog who would have brought the hostler on his first appearance to the ground had not we prevented him for his exterior character was truly grotesque a woollen night cap half drawn over a bushy head of hair a waggoners frock thrown over his shoulders was without stockings but had on a pair of shoes that made a clattering like a troop of horse after he had satisfied himself with taking a full survey of us and our dog he said he would try his mistress again he did not see why she might not let us in he had not left us long before he put his head out of the window and seemingly with some pleasure cried gemmen stay a moment i am coming down i have got the key presently the door was unlocked which raised a most ecstatic impulse in our breasts twas a second heaven nothing but the key of st peter could have given greater bliss a cold collation and a jug of humming ale was soon produced which was crowned with a bouncing bottle of rich old tawny port i need not say with what a zest we battened on our unexpected meal of luxury but that we might not abuse the indulgencies they had shown for so we thought them we went to our beds sooner than we otherwise would have done no peasant from his long days toil ever sounder slept we did not rise till twelve at noon our anxieties and our labors being over we began already to reflect with pleasure on the vicissitudes of the preceding day how dearly we had purchased and how heartily we received our meal but we made it our first business to address our hostess with all the civilities we were masters of for her humanity and for her indulging us with an admittance at so unseasonable an hour but she presently overwhelmed our gratitude ah said she you have no occasion to thank me so much for yourselves twas not for your sake i heard you had a dog with you i pitied him therefore i let you in oh i am vastly fond of dogs and a fine fellow he is looking at him and fawning on him all the while this caused us to laugh immoderately and made our dumb but faithful companion seem still more valuable than ever we breakfasted at noon on the best tea sugar butter cream and rolls that were ever put upon a table then ordered a chaise to jews we had the wilds of sussex in our view a beautiful range of lofty mountains the hedges on each side the road became more scanty and the trees more scarce when we arrived near the margin of the mightiest hill we mutually agreed to leave our chaise a while and obtain the formidable height the turf which clothed its bulky sides was smooth and green nibbled by the sheep the air was thinner still and thinner as we ascended toward the top and when we had obtained the summit a sweet refreshing breeze restored us from our lassitude this was a novel scene indeed the sea disclosed itself upon our left and distant was the view on every side in different parts were seen the careless shepherd and his watchful cur stretched upon the ground while the harmless flock was feeding near his side jews had a beautiful effect the river glistening in the valley the venerable castle mantled over with ivy overlooked the town this caused us to observe that the very spot on which we stood so silent and serene was once the seat of war for here in times of old did many a saxon with a briton fall yon flinty walls stood many a siege and all these plains were anarchy and uproar but peace now reigns and pure tranquillity here we could have roamed the livelong day but growing anxious for our journeys end descended to our chaise and made the best of our way to brighthelmstone we went through jews the town is beautiful and erected on the declivity of a hill the houses chiefly built with flint cut into squares like bricks and every house almost has its arbor of jessamine at the door the inhabitants rich but proud and boorish the women handsome but illiterate the inns are spacious but exorbitant were it not for these obstructions i do not know a town that i would sooner wish to make my residence when we had got through jews we presently arrived at brighthelmstone though we could see little of the town till we were close upon its borders the transition was great the silent rural scene was now no more the gay beaumonde were here assembled in all the hurry of a jubilee the racket of the carriages and the rushing of the ocean made a glorious uproar i had not been here a day before my muse began to wanton in my mind and tumbled forth the following poetical tagg  the tagg or brighthelmstone guide  the tagg or brighthelmstone guide to r b  d esquire oxford you say you vastly long to hear what great inducements we have here that coaxes all our courtiers down and half depopulates the town like bath you think our streets are fine our squares and crescents all divine you think our hills and vales produce the pomgranate or nectar juice in rhyme you ask me to relate the wonders of its present state though youre a critic yet i will try to give it you in poetry this town or village of renown like london bridge half broken down few yers ago was worse than wapping not fit for human soul to stop in but now like to a wornout shoe by patching well the place will do you would wonder much i am sure to see how it is becrammd with quality here lords and ladies often carouse together in a tiny house like joan and darby in their cot with stool and table spit and pot and what his valet would despise his lordship praises to the skies but such the ton is such the case you will see the first of rank or place with star and riband all profuse duck at his doorway like a goose the humble beam was placed so low perhaps to teach some clown to bow the air is pure as pure can be and such an aspect of the sea as you perhaps never saw before from off the side of any shore on one hand ceres spread her plain and on the other over the main many a bark majestic laves upon the salt and buoyant waves the hills all mantld over with green a friendly shelter to the styene whenever the rugged boreas blows bemingled with unwelcome snows such is the place and situation such is the reigning seat of fashion brighthelmstone july   th      the tabernacle to m p a esquire you perhaps have not

out at the door i judiciously sneaked twas a thousand to one but my pocket was picked i plainly could see through the farcical joke the preacher was clad in a mystical cloak by snaring my heart and by blinding my eyes he thought to deceive me in holy disguise brighthelmstone august        to the rev mr h  d i have just left a scene and had you been present i am sure you would have thought it was wondrous pleasant the other morn as my lady fallal was at tea just after she would pickled herself in the sea she gaped and she yawnd and said it was strange that the sea should have made such a wonderful change she rose to the glass her old tresses to plume then smiled on herself and she fancied a bloom lord saunter was there like herself in decay who came down to wash all his humors away pray my good lord said my lady fallal dont you think it a heaven compared to pall mall what though we have no park nor a tree to be seen but yet there is that little sweet level the styene it is a damnable town says my lord you will agree but then says my lady my lord there is the sea then says my lord in a jocular strain i dont think i ever shall sea it again at length then the thread of the subject to break my lady proposed some excursion to take for time seems to hang here most sadly on hand although it is the firstfashiond place in the land ods bobs says my lord there is a raffle on foot that is good says my lady so off they went to it you would have laughed to have seen em or amble or hop with a heart full of glee to the booksellers shop the booksellers shop is the change of this place from sir timothy traffic even up to his grace for my lordduke of blenheim prefers the styene to a palace that is fit for a king or a queen but the booksellers shop i must tell all about it the place would be dull as a dunghill without it in a corner sat little miss titup a leering and old lady wishfort sat opposite sneering sir christopher croaker with spindles so taper sat squinting through spectacles over a paper then all of a sudden began he to croak this war with the congress by gd is no joke then addressing himself to a newmarried dame who was deeply engaged with the temple of fame what think you my lady  i dont think at all sir christopher croaker unless of a ball apropos she continued pray what do you say now you talk of a ball will you go to the play sir christopher instantly seized with the dumps he threw down his paper and took to his stumps he wondered how people could ever think of plays in these terrible troublesome critical days a new face appeared in a smart riding hat the whisper was instantly  pray who is that it is miss molly mundungus  what fortune but small  no person of rank then no nothing at all  dont you think she is pretty yes without grace all beauty you know is not centrd in face do but observe how she carries her arms and yet the poor simpleton fancies she charms if she looks for a fortune cries one with a scoff she may wait
