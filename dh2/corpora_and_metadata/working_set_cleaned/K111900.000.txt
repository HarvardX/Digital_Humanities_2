dialogues concerning natural religion  by david hume esquire  printed in       dialogues concerning natural religion pamphilus to hermippus it has been remarked my hermippus that though the ancient philosophers conveyed most of their instruction in the form of dialogue this method of composition has been little practiced in later ages and has seldom succeeded in the hands of those who have attempted it accurate and regular argument indeed such as is now expected of philosophical enquirers naturally throws a man into the methodical and didactic manner where he can immediately without preparation explain the point at which he aims and thence proceed without interruption to deduce the proofs on which it is established to deliver a system in conversation scarcely appears natural and while the dialoguewriter desires by departing from the direct style of composition to give a freer air to his performance and avoid the appearance of author and reader he is apt to run into a worse inconvenience and convey the image of pedagogue and pupil or if he carries on the dispute in the natural spirit of good company by throwing in a variety of topics and preserving a proper balance among the speakers he often loses so much time in preparations and transitions that the reader will scarcely think himself compensated by all the graces of dialogue for the order brevity and precision which are sacrificed to them  there are some subjects however to which dialoguewriting is peculiarly adapted and where it is still preferable to the direct and simple method of composition  any point of doctrine which is so obvious that it scarcely admits of dispute but at the same time so important that it cannot be too often inculcated seems to require some such method of handling it where the novelty of the manner may compensate the triteness of the subject where the vivacity of conversation may enforce the precept and where the variety of lights presented by various personages and characters may appear neither tedious nor redundant  any question of philosophy on the other hand which is so obscure and uncertain that human reason can reach no fixed determination with regard to it if it should be treated at all seems to lead us naturally into the style of dialogue and conversation reasonable men may be allowed to differ where no one can reasonably be positive opposite sentiments even without any decision afford an agreeable amusement and if the subject be curious and interesting the book carries us in a manner into company and unites the two greatest and purest pleasures of human life study and society  happily these circumstances are all to be found in the subject of natural religion what truth so obvious so certain as the being of a god which the most ignorant ages have acknowledged for which the most refined geniuses have ambitiously striven to produce new proofs and arguments what truth so important as this which is the ground of all our hopes the surest foundation of morality the firmest support of society and the only principle which ought never to be a moment absent from our thoughts and meditations but in treating of this obvious and important truth what obscure questions occur concerning the nature of that divine being his attributes his decrees his plan of providence these have been always subjected to the disputations of men concerning these human reason has not reached any certain determination but these are topics so interesting that we cannot restrain our restless enquiry with regard to them though nothing but doubt uncertainty and contradiction have as yet been the result of our most accurate researches  this i had lately occasion to observe while i passed as usual part of the summerseason with cleanthes and was present at those conversations of his with philo and demea of which i gave you lately some imperfect account your curiosity you then told me was so excited that i must of necessity enter into a more exact detail of their reasonings and display those various systems which they advanced with regard to so delicate a subject as that of natural religion the remarkable contrast in their characters still farther raised your expectations while you opposed the accurate philosophical turn of cleanthes to the careless skepticism of philo or compared either of their dispositions with the rigid inflexible orthodoxy of demea my youth rendered me a mere auditor of their disputes and that curiosity natural to the early season of life has so deeply imprinted in my memory the whole chain and connection of their arguments that i hope i shall not omit or confound any considerable part of them in the recital  part i after i joined the company part i whom i found sitting in cleanthess library demea paid cleanthes some compliments on the great care which he took of my education and on his unwearied perseverance and constancy in all his friendships the father of pamphilus said he was your intimate friend the son is your pupil and may indeed be regarded as your adopted son were we to judge by the pains which you bestow in conveying to him every useful branch of literature and science you are no more wanting i am persuaded in prudence than in industry i shall therefore communicate to you a maxim which i have observed with regard to my own children that i may learn how far it agrees with your practice the method i follow in their education is founded on the saying of an ancient that students of philosophy ought first to learn logics then ethics next physics last of all the nature of the gods chrysippus apud plut de repug stoicorum  this science of natural theology according to him being the most profound and abstruse of any required the maturest judgment in its students and none but a mind enriched with all the other sciences can safely be entrusted with it  are you so late says philo in teaching your children the principles of religion is there no danger of their neglecting or rejecting altogether those opinions of which they have heard so little during the whole course of their education it is only as a science replied demea subjected to human reasoning and disputation that i postpone the study of natural theology to season their minds with early piety is my chief care and by continual precept and instruction and i hope too by example i imprint deeply on their tender minds an habitual reverence for all the principles of religion while they pass through every other science i still remark the uncertainty of each part the eternal disputations of men the obscurity of all philosophy and the strange ridiculous conclusions which some of the greatest geniuses have derived from the principles of mere human reason having thus tamed their mind to a proper submission and selfdiffidence i have no longer any scruple of opening to them the greatest mysteries of religion nor apprehend any danger from that assuming arrogance of philosophy which may lead them to reject the most established doctrines and opinions  your precaution says philo of seasoning your childrens minds with early piety is certainly very reasonable and no more than is requisite in this profane and irreligious age but what i chiefly admire in your plan of education is your method of drawing advantage from the very principles of philosophy and learning which by inspiring pride and selfsufficiency have commonly in all ages been found so destructive to the principles of religion the vulgar indeed we may remark who are unacquainted with science and profound enquiry observing the endless disputes of the learned have commonly a thorough contempt for philosophy and rivet themselves the faster by that means in the great points of theology which have been taught them those who enter a little into study and enquiry finding many appearances of evidence in doctrines the newest and most extraordinary think nothing too difficult for human reason and presumptuously breaking through all senses profane the inmost fanctuaries of the temple but cleanthes will i hope agree with me that after we have abandoned ignorance the surest remedy there is still one expedient left to prevent this profane liberty let demeas principles be improved and cultivated let us become thoroughly sensible of the weakness blindness and narrow limits of human reason let us duly consider its uncertainty and endless contrarieties even in subjects of common life and practice let the errors and deceits of our very senses be set before us the insuperable difficulties which attend first principles in all systems the contradictions which adhere to the very ideas of matter cause and effect extension space time motion and in a word quantity of all kinds the object of the only science that can fairly pretend to any certainty or evidence when these topics are displayed in their full light as they are by some philosophers and almost all divines who can retain such confidence in this frail faculty of reason as to pay any regard to its determinations in points so sublime so abstruse so remote from common life and experience when the coherence of the parts of a stone or even that composition of parts which renders it extended when these familiar objects i say are so inexplicable and contain circumstances so repugnant and contradictory with what assurance can we decide concerning the origin of worlds or trace their history from eternity to eternity  while philo pronounced these words i could observe a smile in the countenance both of demea and cleanthes that of demea seemed to imply an unreserved satisfaction in the doctrines delivered but in cleanthess features i could distinguish an air of finesse as if he perceived some raillery or artificial malice in the reasonings of philo  you propose then philo said cleanthes to erect religious faith on philosophical skepticism and you think that if certainty or evidence be expelled from every other subject of enquiry it will all retire to these theological doctrines and there acquire a superior force and authority whether your skepticism be as absolute and sincere as you pretend we shall learn by and by when the company breaks up we shall then see whether you go out at the door or the window and whether you really doubt if your body has gravity or can be injured by its fall according to popular opinion derived from our fallacious senses and more fallacious experience and this consideration demea may i think fairly serve to abate our ill will to this humorous sect of the skeptics if they be thoroughly in earnest they will not long trouble the world with their doubts cavils and disputes if they be only in jest they are perhaps bad ralliers but can never be very dangerous either to the state to philosophy or to religion  in reality philo continued he it seems certain that though a man in a flush of humor after intense reflection on the many contradictions and imperfections of human reason may entirely renounce all belief and opinion it is impossible for him to persevere in this total skepticism or make it appear in his conduct for a few hours external objects press in upon him passions solicit him his philosophical melancholy dissipates and even the utmost violence upon his own temper will not be able during any time to preserve the poor appearance of skepticism and for what reason impose on himself such a violence this is a point in which it will be impossible for him ever to satisfy himself consistently with his skeptical principles so that upon the whole nothing could be more ridiculous than the principles of the ancient pyrrhonians if in reality they endeavored as is pretended to extend throughout the same skepticism which they had learned from the declamations of their schools and which they ought to have confined to them  in this view there appears a great resemblance between the sects of the stoics and pyrrhonians though perpetual antagonists and both of them seem founded on this erroneous maxim that what a man can perform sometimes and in some dispositions he can perform always and in every disposition when the mind by stoical reflections is elevated into a sublime enthusiasm of virtue and strongly smit with any species of honor or public good the utmost bodily pain and sufferance will not prevail over such a high sense of duty and it is possible perhaps by its means even to smile and exult in the midst of tortures if this sometimes may be the case in fact and reality much more may a philosopher in his school or even in his closet work himself up to such an enthusiasm and support in imagination the acutest pain or most calamitous event which he can possibly conceive but how shall he support this enthusiasm itself the bent of his mind relaxes and cannot be recalled at pleasure avocations lead him astray misfortunes attack him unawares and the philosopher sinks by degrees into the plebeian  i allow of your comparison between the stoics and skeptics replied philo but you may observe at the same time that though the mind cannot in stoicism support the highest flights of philosophy yet even when it sinks lower it still retains somewhat of its former disposition and the effects of the stoics reasoning will appear in his conduct in common life and through the whole tenor of his actions the ancient schools particularly that of zeno produced examples of virtue and constancy which seem astonishing to present times  vain wisdom all and false philosophy yet with a pleasing sorcery could charm pain for a while or anguish and excite fallacious hope or arm the obdurate breast with stubborn patience as with triple steel in like manner if a man has accustomed himself to skeptical considerations on the uncertainty and narrow limits of reason he will not entirely forget them when he turns his reflection on other subjects but in all his philosophical principles and reasoning i dare not say in his common conduct he will be found different from those who either never formed any opinions in the case or have entertained sentiments more favorable to human reason  to whatever length any one may push his speculative principles of skepticism he must act i own and live and converse like other men and for this conduct he is not obliged to give any other reason than the absolute necessity he lies under of so doing if he ever carries his speculations farther than this necessity constrains him and philosophises either on natural or moral subjects he is allured by a certain pleasure and satisfaction which he finds in employing himself after that manner he considers besides that every one even in common life is constrained to have more or less of this philosophy that from our earliest infancy we make continual advances in forming more general principles of conduct and reasoning that the larger experience we acquire and the stronger reason we are endued with we always render our principles the more general and comprehensive and that what we call philosophy is nothing but a more regular and methodical operation of the same kind to philosophise on such subjects is nothing essentially different from reasoning on common life and we may only expect greater stability if not greater truth from our philosophy on account of its exacter and more scrupulous method of proceeding  but when we look beyond human affairs and the properties of the surrounding bodies when we carry our speculations into the two eternities before and after the present state of things into the creation and formation of the universe the existence and properties of spirits the powers and operations of one universal spirit existing without beginning and without end omnipotent omniscient immutable infinite and incomprehensible we must be far removed from the smallest tendency to skepticism not to be apprehensive that we have here got quite beyond the reach of our faculties so long as we confine our speculations to trade or morals or politics or criticism we make appeals every moment to common sense and experience which strengthen our philosophical conclusions and remove at least in part the suspicion which we so justly entertain with regard to every reasoning that is very subtle and refined but in theological reasonings we have not this advantage while at the same time we are employed upon objects which we must be sensible are too large for our grasp and of all others require most to be familiarised to our apprehension we are like foreigners in a strange country to whom every thing must seem suspicious and who are in danger every moment of transgressing against the laws and customs of the people with whom they live and converse we know not how far we ought to trust our vulgar methods of reasoning in such a subject since even in common life and in that province which is peculiarly appropriated to them we cannot account for them and are entirely guided by a kind of instinct or necessity in employing them  all skeptics pretend that if reason be considered in an abstract view it furnishes invincible arguments against itself and that we could never retain any conviction or assurance on any subject were not the skeptical reasonings so refined and subtle that they are not able to counterpoise the more solid and more natural arguments derived from the senses and experience but it is evident whenever our arguments lose this advantage and run wide of common life that the most refined skepticism comes to be upon a footing with them and is able to oppose and counterbalance them the one has no more weight than the other the mind must remain in suspense between them and it is that very suspense or balance which is the triumph of skepticism  but i observe says cleanthes with regard to you philo and all speculative skeptics that your doctrine and practice are as much at variance in the most abstruse points of theory as in the conduct of common life wherever evidence discovers itself you adhere to it notwithstanding your pretended skepticism and i can observe too some of your sect to be as decisive as those who make greater professions of certainty and assurance in reality would not a man be ridiculous who pretended to reject newtons explication of the wonderful phenomenon of the rainbow because that explication gives a minute anatomy of the rays of light a subject forsooth too refined for human comprehension and what would you say to one who having nothing particular to object to the arguments of copernicus and galilaeo for the motion of the earth should withold his assent on that general principle that these subjects were too magnificent and remote to be explained by the narrow and fallacious reason of mankind  there is indeed a kind of brutish and ignorant skepticism as you well observed which gives the vulgar a general prejudice against what they do not easily understand and makes them reject every principle which requires elaborate reasoning to prove and establish it this species of skepticism is fatal to knowledge not to religion since we find that those who make greatest profession of it give often their assent not only to the great truths of theism and natural theology but even to the most absurd tenets which a traditional superstition has recommended to them they firmly believe in witches though they will not believe nor attend to the most simple proposition of euclid but the refined and philosophical skeptics fall into an inconsistence of an opposite nature they push their researches into the most abstruse corners of science and their assent attends them in every step proportioned to the evidence which they meet with they are even obliged to acknowledge that the most abstruse and remote objects are those which are best explained by philosophy light is in reality anatomized the true system of the heavenly bodies is discovered and ascertained but the nourishment of bodies by food is still an inexplicable mystery the cohesion of the parts of matter is still incomprehensible these skeptics therefore are obliged in every question to consider each particular evidence apart and proportion their assent to the precise degree of evidence which occurs this is their practice in all natural mathematical moral and political science and why not the same i ask in the theological and religious why must conclusions of this nature be alone rejected on the general presumption of the insufficiency of human reason without any particular discussion of the evidence is not such an unequal conduct a plain proof of prejudice and passion  our senses you say are fallacious our understanding erroneous our ideas even of the most familiar objects extension duration motion full of absurdities and contradictions you defy me to solve the difficulties or reconcile the repugnancies which you discover in them i have not capacity for so great an undertaking i have not leisure for it i perceive it to be superfluous your own conduct in every circumstance refutes your principles and shows the firmest reliance on all the received maxims of science morals prudence and behavior  i shall never assent to so harsh an opinion as that of a celebrated writer lart de penser  who says that the skeptics are not a sect of philosophers they are only a sect of liars i may however affirm i hope without offense that they are a sect of jesters or ralliers but for my part whenever i find myself disposed to mirth and amusement i shall certainly choose my entertainment of a less perplexing and abstruse nature a comedy a novel or at most a history seems a more natural recreation than such metaphysical subtilties and abstractions  in vain would the skeptic make a distinction between science and common life or between one science and another the arguments employed in all if just are of a similar nature and contain the same force and evidence or if there be any difference among them the advantage lies entirely on the side of theology and natural religion many principles of mechanics are founded on very abstruse reasoning yet no man who has any pretensions to science even no speculative skeptic pretends to entertain the least doubt with regard to them the copernican system contains the most surprising paradox and the most contrary to our natural conceptions to appearances and to our very senses yet even monks and inquisitors are now constrained to withdraw their opposition to it and shall philo a man of so liberal a genius and extensive knowledge entertain any general undistinguished scruples with regard to the religious hypothesis which is founded on the simplest and most obvious arguments and unless it meets with artificial obstacles has such easy access and admission into the mind of man  and here we may observe continued he turning himself toward demea a pretty curious circumstance in the history of the sciences after the union of philosophy with the popular religion upon the first establishment of christianity nothing was more usual among all religious teachers than declamations against reason against the senses against every principle derived merely from human research and enquiry all the topics of the ancient academics were adopted by the fathers and thence propagated for several ages in every school and pulpit throughout christendom the reformers embraced the same principles of reasoning or rather declamation and all panegyrics on the excellency of faith were sure to be interlarded with some severe strokes of satire against natural reason a celebrated prelate too mons huet  of the romish communion a man of the most extensive learning who wrote a demonstration of christianity has also composed a treatise which contains all the cavils of the boldest and most determined pyrrhonism lock seems to have been the first christian who ventured openly to assert that faith was nothing but a species of reason that religion was only a branch of philosophy and that a chain of arguments similar to that which established any truth in morals politics or physics was always employed in discovering all the principles of theology natural and revealed the ill use which bail and other libertines made of the philosophical skepticism of the fathers and first reformers still farther propagated the judicious sentiment of mr lock and it is now in a manner avowed by all pretenders to reasoning and philosophy that atheist and skeptic are almost synonymous and as is certain that no man is in earnest when he professes the latter principle i would fain hope that there are as few who seriously maintain the former  dont you remember said philo the excellent saying of lord bacon on this head that a little philosophy replied cleanthes makes a man an atheist a great deal converts him to religion that is a very judicious remark too said philo but what i have in my eye is another passage where having mentioned davids fool who said in his heart there is no god this great philosopher observes that the atheists nowadays have a double share of folly for they are not contented to say in their hearts there is no god but they also utter that impiety with their lips and are thereby guilty of multiplied indiscretion and imprudence such people though they were ever so much in earnest cannot methinks be very formidable  but though you should rank me in this class of fools i cannot forbear communicating a remark that occurs to me from the history of the religious and irreligious skepticism with which you have entertained us it appears to me that there are strong symptoms of priestcraft in the whole progress of this affair during ignorant ages such as those which followed the dissolution of the ancient schools the priests perceived that atheism deism or heresy of any kind could only proceed from the presumptuous questioning of received opinions and from a belief that human reason was equal to every thing education had then a mighty influence over the minds of men and was almost equal in force to those suggestions of the senses and common understanding by which the most determined skeptic must allow himself to be governed but at present when the influence of education is much diminished and men from a more open commerce of the world have learned to compare the popular principles of different nations and ages our sagacious divines have changed their whole system of philosophy and talk the language of stoics platonists and peripatetics not that of pyrrhonians and academics if we distrust human reason we have now no other principle to lead us into religion thus skeptics in one age dogmatists in another whichever system best suits the purpose of these reverend gentlemen in giving them an ascendant over mankind they are sure to make it their favorite principle and established tenet  it is very natural said cleanthes for men to embrace those principles by which they find they can best defend their doctrines nor need we have any recourse to priestcraft to account for so reasonable an expedient and surely nothing can afford a stronger presumption that any set of principles are true and ought to be embraced than to observe that they tend to the confirmation of true religion and serve to confound the cavils of atheists libertines and freethinkers of all denominations  part ii i must own cleanthes said demea that nothing can more surprise me than the light in which you have all along put this argument by the whole tenor of your discourse one would imagine that you were maintaining the being of a god against the cavils of atheists and infidels and were necessitated to become a champion for that fundamental principle of all religion but this i hope is not by any means a question among us no man no man at least of common sense i am persuaded ever entertained a serious doubt with regard to a truth so certain and selfevident the question is not concerning the being but the nature of god this i affirm from the infirmities of human understanding to be altogether incomprehensible and unknown to us the essence of that supreme mind his attributes the manner of his existence the very nature of his duration these and every particular which regards so divine a being part ii are mysterious to men finite weak and blind creatures we ought to humble ourselves in his august presence and conscious of our frailties adore in silence his infinite perfections which eye has not seen ear has not heard neither has it entered into the heart of man to conceive they are covered in a deep cloud from human curiosity it is profaneness to attempt penetrating through these sacred obscurities and next to the impiety of denying his existence is the temerity of prying into his nature and essence decrees and attributes  but lest you should think that my piety has here got the better of my philosophy i shall support my opinion if it needs any support by a very great authority i might cite all the divines almost from the foundation of christianity who have ever treated of this or any other theological subject but i shall confine myself at present to one equally celebrated for piety and philosophy it is father malebranche who i remember thus expresses himself recherche de la verite live   chap    one ought not so much says he to call god a spirit in order to express positively what he is as in order to signify that he is not matter he is a being infinitely perfect of this we cannot doubt but in the same manner as we ought not to imagine even supposing him corporeal that he is clothed with a human body as the anthropomorphites asserted under color that that figure was the most perfect of any so neither ought we to imagine that the spirit of god has human ideas or bears any resemblance to our spirit under color that we know nothing more perfect than a human mind we ought rather to believe that as he comprehends the perfections of matter without being materialhe comprehends also the perfections of created spirits without being spirit in the manner we conceive spirit that his true name is he that is or in other words being without restriction all being the being infinite and universal  after so great an authority demea replied philo as that which you have produced and a thousand more which you might produce it would appear ridiculous in me to add my sentiment or express my approbation of your doctrine but furely where reasonable men treat these subjects the question can never be concerning the being but only the nature of the deity the sormer truth as you well observe is unquestionable and selfevident nothing exists without a cause and the original cause of this universe whatever it be we call god and piously ascribe to him every species of perfection whoever scruples this fundamental truth deserves every punishment which can be inflicted among philosophers to wit the greatest ridicule contempt and disapprobation but as all perfection is entirely relative we ought never to imagine that we comprehend the attributes of this divine being or to suppose that his perfections have any analogy or likeness to the perfections of a human creature wisdom thought design knowledge these we justly ascribe to him because these words are honorable among men and we have no other language or other conceptions by which we can express our adoration of him but let us beware left we think that our ideas any wise correspond to his perfections or that his attributes have any resemblance to these qualities among men he is infinitely superior to our limited view and comprehension and is more the object of worship in the temple than of disputation in the schools  in reality cleanthes continued he there is no need of having recourse to that affected skepticism so displeasing to you in order to come at this determination our ideas reach no farther than our experience we have no experience of divine attributes and operations i need not conclude my syllogism you can draw the inference yourself and it is a pleasure to me and i hope to you too that just reasoning and sound piety here concur in the same conclusion and both of them establish the adorably mysterious and incomprehensible nature of the supreme being  not to lose any time in circumlocutions said cleanthes addressing himself to demea much less in replying to the pious declamations of philo i shall briefly explain how i conceive this matter look round the world contemplate the whole and every part of it you will find it to be nothing but one great machine subdivided into an infinite number of lesser machines which again admit of subdivisions to a degree beyond what human senses and faculties can trace and explain all these various machines and even their most minute parts are adjusted to each other with an accuracy which ravishes into admiration all men who have ever contemplated them the curious adapting of means to ends throughout all nature resembles exactly though it much exceeds the productions of human contrivance of human design thought wisdom and intelligence since therefore the effects resemble each other we are led to infer by all the rules of analogy that the causes also resemble and that the author of nature is somewhat similar to the mind of man though possessed of much larger faculties proportioned to the grandeur of the work which he has executed by this argument a posteriori and by this argument alone do we prove at once the existence of a deity and his similarity to human mind and intelligence  i shall be so free cleanthes said demea as to tell you that from the beginning i could not approve of your conclusion concerning the similarity of the deity to men still less can i approve of the mediums by which you endeavor to establish it what no demonstration of the being of a god no abstract arguments no proofs a priori are these which have hitherto been so much insisted on by philosophers all fallacy all sophism can we reach no farther in this subject than experience and probability i will not say that this is betraying the cause of a deity but surely by this affected candor you give advantages to atheists which they never could obtain by the mere dint of argument and reasoning  what i chiefly scruple in this subject said philo is not so much that all religious arguments are by cleanthes reduced to experience as that they appear not to be even the most certain and irrefragable of that inferior kind that a stone will fall that fire will burn that the earth has solidity we have observed a thousand and a thousand times and when any new instance of this nature is presented we draw without hesitation the accustomed inference the exact similarity of the cases gives us a perfect assurance of a similar event and a stronger evidence is never desired nor sought after but wherever you depart in the least from the similarity of the cases you diminish proportionably the evidence and may at last bring it to a very weak analogy which is confessedly liable to error and uncertainty after having experienced the circulation of the blood in human creatures we make no doubt that it takes place in titius and maevius but from its circulation in frogs and fishes it is only a presumption though a strong one from analogy that it takes place in men and other animals the analogical reasoning is much weaker when we infer the circulation of the sap in vegetables from our experience that the blood circulates in animals and those who hastily followed that imperfect analogy are found by more accurate experiments to have been mistaken  if we see a house cleanthes we conclude with the greatest certainty that it had an architect or builder because this is precisely that species of effect which we have experienced to proceed from that species of cause but surely you will not affirm that the universe bears such a resemblance to a house that we can with the same certainty infer a similar cause or that the analogy is here entire and perfect the dissimilitude is so striking that the utmost you can here pretend to is a guess a conjecture a presumption concerning a similar cause and how that pretension will be received in the world i leave you to consider  it would surely be very ill received replied cleanthes and i should be deservedly blamed and detested did i allow that the proofs of a deity amounted to no more than a guess or conjecture but is the whole adjustment of means to ends in a house and in the universe so slight a resemblance the economy of final causes the order proportion and arrangement of every part steps of a stair are plainly contrived that human legs may use them in mounting and this inference is certain and infallible human legs are also contrived for walking and mounting and this inference i allow is not altogether so certain because of the dissimilarity which you remark but does it therefore deserve the name only of presumption or conjecture  good god cried demea interrupting him where are we zealous defenders of religion allow that the proofs of a deity fall short of perfect evidence and you philo on whose assistance i depended in proving the adorable mysteriousness of the divine nature do you assent to all these extravagant opinions of cleanthes for what other name can i give them or why spare my censure when such principles are advanced supported by such an authority before so young a man as pamphilus  you seem not to apprehend replied philo that i argue with cleanthes in his own way and by showing him the dangerous consequences of his tenets hope at last to reduce him to our opinion but what sticks most with you i observe is the representation which cleanthes has made of the argument a posteriori and finding that that argument is likely to escape your hold and vanish into air you think it so disguised that you can scarcely believe it to be set in its true light now however much i may dissent in other respects from the dangerous principles of cleanthes i must allow that he has fairly represented that argument and i shall endeavor so to state the matter to you that you will entertain no farther scruples with regard to it  were a man to abstract from every thing which he knows or has seen he would be altogether incapable merely from his own ideas to determine what kind of scene the universe must be or to give the preference to one state or situation of things above another for as nothing which he clearly conceives could be esteemed impossible or implying a contradiction every chimera of his fancy would be upon an equal footing nor could he assign any just reason why he adheres to one idea or system and rejects the others which are equally possible  again after he opens his eyes and contemplates the world as it really is it would be impossible for him at first to assign the cause of any one event much less of the whole of things or of the universe he might set his fancy a rambling and she might bring him in an infinite variety of reports and representations these would all be possible but being all equally possible he would never of himself give a satisfactory account for his preferring one of them to the rest experience alone can point out to him the true cause of any phenomenon  now according to this method of reasoning demea it follows and is indeed tacitly allowed by cleanthes himself that order arrangement or the adjustment of final causes is not of itself any proof of design but only so far as it has been experienced to proceed from that principle for aught we can know a priori matter may contain the source or spring of order originally within itself as well as mind does and there is no more difficulty in conceiving that the several elements from an internal unknown cause may fall into the most exquisite arrangement than to conceive that their ideas in the great universal mind from a like internal unknown cause fall into that arrangement the equal possibility of both these suppositions is allowed but by experience we find according to cleanthes that there is a difference between them throw several pieces of steel together without shape or form they will never arrange themselves so as to compose a watch stone and mortar and wood without an architect never erect a house but the ideas in a human mind we see by an unknown inexplicable economy arrange themselves so as to form the plan of a watch or house experience therefore proves that there is an original principle of order in mind not in matter from similar effects we infer similar causes the adjustment of means to ends is alike in the universe as in a machine of human contrivance the causes therefore must be resembling  i was from the beginning scandalized i must own with this resemblance which is asserted between the deity and human creatures and must conceive it to imply such a degradation of the supreme being as no found theist could endure with your assistance therefore demea i shall endeavor to defend what you justly call the adorable mysteriousness of the divine nature and shall refute this reasoning of cleanthes provided he allows that i have made a fair representation of it  when cleanthes had assented philo after a short pause proceeded in the following manner  that all inferences cleanthes concerning fact are founded on experience and that all experimental reasonings are founded on the supposition that similar causes prove similar effects and similar effects similar causes i shall not at present much dispute with you but observe i entreat you with what extreme caution all just reasoners proceed in the transferring of experiments to similar cases unless the cases be exactly similar they repose no perfect confidence in applying their past observation to any particular phenomenon every alteration of circumstances occasions a doubt concerning the event and it requires new experiments to prove certainly that the new circumstances are of no moment or importance a change in bulk situation arrangement age disposition of the air or surrounding bodies any of these particulars may be attended with the most unexpected consequences and unless the objects be quite familiar to us it is the highest temerity to expect with assurance after any of these changes an event similar to that which before fell under our observation the slow and deliberate steps of philosophers here if any where are distinguished from the precipitate march of the vulgar who hurried on by the smallest similitude are incapable of all discernment or consideration  but can you think cleanthes that your usual phlegm and philosophy have been preserved in so wide a step as you have taken when you compared to the universe houses ships furniture machines and from their similarity in some circumstances inferred a similarity in their causes thought design intelligence such as we discover in men and other animals is no more than one of the springs and principles of the universe as well as heat or cold attraction or repulsion and a hundred others which fall under daily observation it is an active cause by which some particular parts of nature we find produce alterations on other parts but can a conclusion with any propriety be transferred from parts to the whole does not the great disproportion bar all comparison and inference from observing the growth of a hair can we learn any thing concerning the generation of a man would the manner of a leafs blowing even though perfectly known afford us any instruction concerning the vegetation of a tree  but allowing that we were to take the operations of one part of nature upon another for the foundation of our judgment concerning the origin of the whole which never can be admitted yet why select so minute so weak so bounded a principle as the reason and design of animals is found to be upon this planet what peculiar privilege has this little agitation of the brain which we call thought that we must thus make it the model of the whole universe our partiality in our own favor does indeed present it on all occasions but sound philosophy ought carefully to guard against so natural an illusion  so far from admitting continued philo that the operations of a part can afford us any just conclusion concerning the origin of the whole i will not allow any one part to form a rule for another part if the latter be very remote from the former is there any reasonable ground to conclude that the inhabitants of other planets possess thought intelligence reason or any thing similar to these faculties in men when nature has so extremely diversified her manner of operation in this small globe can we imagine that she incessantly copies herself throughout so immense a universe and if thought as we may well suppose be confined merely to this narrow corner and has even there so limited a sphere of action with what propriety can we assign it for the original cause of all things the narrow views of a peasant who makes his domestic economy the rule for the government of kingdoms is in comparison a pardonable sophism  but were we ever so much assured that a thought and reason resembling the human were to be found throughout the whole universe and were its activity elsewhere vastly greater and more commanding than it appears in this globe yet i cannot see why the operations of a world constituted arranged adjusted can with any propriety be extended to a world which is in its embryostate and is advancing toward that constitution and arrangement by observation we know somewhat of the economy action and nourishment of a finished animal but we must transfer with great caution that observation to the growth of a foetus in the womb and still more to the formation of an animalcule in the loins of its male parent nature we find even from our limited experience possesses an infinite number of springs and principles which incessantly discover themselves on every change of her position and situation and what new and unknown principles would actuate her in so new and unknown a situation as that of the formation of a universe we cannot without the utmost temerity pretend to determine  a very small part of this great system during a very short time is very imperfectly discovered to us and do we thence pronounce decisively concerning the origin of the whole  admirable conclusion stone wood brick iron brass have not at this time in this minute globe of earth an order or arrangement without human art and contrivance therefore the universe could not originally attain its order and arrangement without something similar to human art but is a part of nature a rule for another part very wide of the former is it a rule for the whole is a very small part a rule for the universe is nature in one situation a certain rule for nature in another situation vastly different from the former  and can you blame me cleanthes if i here imitate the prudent reserve of simonides who according to the noted story being asked by hiero what god was desired a day to think of it and then two days more and after that manner continually prolonged the term without ever bringing in his definition or description could you even blame me if i had answered at first that i did not know and was sensible that this subject lay vastly beyond the reach of my faculties you might cry out skeptic and rallier as much as you pleased but having found in so many other subjects much more familiar the imperfections and even contradictions of human reason i never should expect any success from its feeble conjectures in a subject so sublime and so remote from the sphere of our observation when two species of objects have always been observed to be conjoined together i can infer by custom the existence of one wherever i see the existence of the other and this i call an argument from experience but how this argument can have place where the objects as in the present case are single individual without parallel or specific resemblance may be difficult to explain and will any man tell me with a serious countenance that an orderly universe must arise from some thought and art like the human because we have experience of it to ascertain this reasoning it were requisite that we had experience of the origin of worlds and it is not sufficient surely that we have seen ships and cities arise from human art and contrivance  philo was proceeding in this vehement manner somewhat between jest and earnest as it appeared to me when he observed some signs of impatience in cleanthes and then immediately stopped short what i had to suggest said cleanthes is only that you would not abuse terms or make use of popular expressions to subvert philosophical reasonings you know that the vulgar often distinguish reason from experience even where the question relates only to matter of fact and existence though it is found where that reason is properly analyzed that it is nothing but a species of experience to prove by experience the origin of the universe from mind is not more contrary to common speech than to prove the motion of the earth from the same principle and a caviller might raise all the same objections to the copernican system which you have urged against my reasonings have you other earths might he say which you have seen to move have  yes cried philo interrupting him we have other earths is not the moon another earth which we see to turn round its center is not venus another earth where we observe the same phenomenon are not the revolutions of the sun also a confirmation from analogy of the same theory all the planets are they not earths which revolve about the sun are not the satellites moons which move round jupiter and saturn and along with these primary planets round the sun these analogies and resemblances with others which i have not mentioned are the sole proofs of the copernican system and to you it belongs to consider whether you have any analogies of the same kind to support your theory  in reality cleanthes continued he the modern system of astronomy is now so much received by all enquirers and has become so essential a part even of our earliest education that we are not commonly very scrupulous in examining the reasons upon which it is founded it is now become a matter of mere curiosity to study the first writers on that subject who had the full force of prejudice to encounter and were obliged to turn their arguments on every side in order to render them popular and convincing but if we peruse galilaeos famous dialogues concerning the system of the world we shall find that that great genius one of the sublimest that ever existed first bent all his endeavors to prove that there was no foundation for the distinction commonly made between elementary and celestial substances the schools proceeding from the illusions of sense had carried this distinction very far and had established the latter substances to be ingenerable incorruptible unalterable impassable and had assigned all the opposite qualities to the former but galilaeo beginning with the moon proved its similarity in every particular to the earth its unequal figure its natural darkness when not illuminated its density its distinction into solid and liquid the variations of its phases the mutual illuminations of the earth and moon their mutual eclipses the inequalities of the lunar surface etc after many instances of this kind with regard to all the planets men plainly saw that these bodies became proper objects of experience and that the similarity of their nature enabled us to extend the same arguments and phenomena from one to the other  in this cautious proceeding of the astronomers you may read your own condemnation cleanthes or rather may see that the subject in which you are engaged exceeds all human reason and enquiry can you pretend to show any such similarity between the fabric of a house and the generation of a universe have you ever seen nature in any such situation as resembles the first arrangement of the elements have worlds ever been formed under your eye and have you had leisure to observe the whole progress of the phenomenon from the first appearance of order to its final consummation if you have then cite your experience and deliver your theory  part iii how the most absurd argument replied cleanthes in the hands of a man of ingenuity and invention may acquire an air of probability are you not aware philo that it became necessary for copernicus and his first disciples to prove the similarity of the terrestrial and celestial matter because several philosophers blinded by old systems and supported by some sensible appearances had denied this similarity but that it is by no means necessary that theists should prove the similarity of the works of nature to those of art because this similarity is selfevident and undeniable the same matter a like form what more is requisite to show an analogy between their causes and to ascertain the origin of all things from a divine purpose and intention your objections i must freely tell you are no better than the abstruse cavils of those philosophers part iii who denied motion and ought to be refuted in the same manner by illustrations examples and instances rather than by serious argument and philosophy  suppose therefore that an articulate voice were heard in the clouds much louder and more melodious than any which human art could ever reach suppose that this voice were extended in the same instant over all nations and spoke to each nation in its own language and dialect suppose that the words delivered not only contain a just sense and meaning but convey some instruction altogether worthy of a benevolent being superior to mankind could you possibly hesitate a moment concerning the cause of this voice and must you not instantly ascribe it to some design or purpose yet i cannot see but all the same objections if they merit that appellation which lie against the system of theism may also be produced against this inference  might you not say that all conclusions concerning fact were founded on experience that when we hear an articulate voice in the dark and thence infer a man it is only the resemblance of the effects which leads us to conclude that there is a like resemblance in the cause but that this extraordinary voice by its loudness extent and flexibility to all languages bears so little analogy to any human voice that we have no reason to suppose any analogy in their causes and consequently that a rational wise coherent speech proceeded you knew not whence from some accidental whistling of the winds not from any divine reason or intelligence you see clearly your own objections in these cavils and i hope too you see clearly that they cannot possibly have more force in the one case than in the other  but to bring the case still nearer the present one of the universe i shall make two suppositions which imply not any absurdity or impossibility suppose that there is a natural universal invariable language common to every individual of human race and that books are natural productions which perpetuate themselves in the same manner with animals and vegetables by descent and propagation several expressions of our passions contain a universal language all brute animals have a natural speech which however limited is very intelligible to their own species and as there are infinitely fewer parts and less contrivance in the finest composition of eloquence than in the coarsest organized body the propagation of an iliad or aeneid is an easier supposition than that of any plant or animal  suppose therefore that you enter into your library thus peopled by natural volumes containing the most refined reason and most exquisite beauty could you possibly open one of them and doubt that its original cause bore the strongest analogy to mind and intelligence when it reasons and discourses when it expostulates argues and enforces its views and topics when it applies sometimes to the pure intellect sometimes to the affections when it collects disposes and adorns every consideration suited to the subject could you persist in asserting that all this at the bottom had really no meaning and that the first formation of this volume in the loins of its original parent proceeded not from thought and design your obstinacy i know reaches not that degree of firmness even your skeptical play and wantonness would be abashed at so glaring an absurdity  but if there be any difference philo between this supposed case and the real one of the universe it is all to the advantage of the latter the anatomy of an animal affords many stronger instances of design than the perusal of livy or tacitus and any objection which you start in the former case by carrying me back to so unusual and extraordinary a scene as the first formation of worlds the same objection has place on the supposition of our vegetating library choose then your party philo without ambiguity or evasion assert either that a rational volume is no proof of a rational cause or admit of a similar cause to all the works of nature  let me here observe too continued cleanthes that this religious argument instead of being weakened by that skepticism so much affected by you rather acquires force from it and becomes more firm and undisputed to exclude all argument or reasoning of every kind is either affectation or madness the declared profession of every reasonable skeptic is only to reject abstruse remote and refined arguments to adhere to common sense and the plain instincts of nature and to assent wherever any reasons strike him with so full a force that he cannot without the greatest violence prevent it now the arguments for natural religion are plainly of this kind and nothing but the most perverse obstinate metaphysics can reject them consider anatomize the eye survey its structure and contrivance and tell me from your own feeling if the idea of a contriver does not immediately flow in upon you with a force like that of sensation the most obvious conclusion surely is in favor of design and it requires time reflection and study to summon up those frivolous though abstruse objections which can support infidelity who can behold the male and female of each species the correspondence of their parts and instincts their passions and whole course of life before and after generation but must be sensible that the propagation of the species is intended by nature millions and millions of such instances present themselves through every part of the universe and no language can convey a more intelligible irresistible meaning than the curious adjustment of final causes to what degree therefore of blind dogmatism must one have attained to reject such natural and such convincing arguments  some beauties in writing we may meet with which seem contrary to rules and which gain the affections and animate the imagination in opposition to all the precepts of criticism and to the authority of the established masters of art and if the argument for theism be as you pretend contradictory to the principles of logic its universal its irresistible influence proves clearly that there may be arguments of a like irregular nature whatever cavils may be urged an orderly world as well as a coherent articulate speech will still be received as an incontestable proof of design and intention  it sometimes happens i own that the religious arguments have not their due influence on an ignorant savage and barbarian not because they are obscure and difficult but because he never asks himself any question with regard to them whence arises the curious structure of an animal from the copulation of its parents and these whence from their parents a few removes set the objects at such a distance that to him they are lost in darkness and confusion nor is he actuated by any curiosity to trace them farther but this is neither dogmatism nor skepticism but stupidity a state of mind very different from your sifting inquisitive disposition my ingenious friend you can trace causes from effects you can compare the most distant and remote objects and your greatest errors proceed not from barrenness of thought and invention but from too luxuriant a fertility which suppresses your natural good sense by a profusion of unnecessary scruples and objections  here i could observe hermippus that philo was a little embarrassed and confounded but while he hesitated in delivering an answer luckily for him demea broke in upon the discourse and saved his countenance  your instance cleanthes said he drawn from books and language being familiar has i confess so much more force on that account but is there not some danger too in this very circumstance and may it not render us presumptuous by making us imagine we comprehend the deity and have some adequate idea of his nature and attributes when i read a volume i enter into the mind and intention of the author i become him in a manner for the instant and have an immediate feeling and conception of those ideas which revolved in his imagination while employed in that composition but so near an approach we never surely can make to the deity his ways are not our ways his attributes are perfect but incomprehensible and this volume of nature contains a great and inexplicable riddle more than any intelligible discourse or reasoning  the ancient platonists you know were the most religious and devout of all the pagan philosophers yet many of them particularly plotinus us expressly declare that intellect or understanding is not to be ascribed to the deity and that our most perfect worship of him consists not in acts of veneration reverence gratitude or love but in a certain mysterious selfannihilation or total extinction of all our faculties these ideas are perhaps too far stretched but still it must be acknowledged that by representing the deity as so intelligible and comprehensible and so similar to a human mind we are guilty of the grossest and most narrow partiality and make ourselves the model of the whole universe  all the sentiments of the human mind gratitude resentment love friendship approbation blame pity emulation envy have a plain reference to the state and situation of man and are calculated for preserving the existence and promoting the activity of such a being in such circumstances it seems therefore unreasonable to transfer such sentiments to a supreme existence or to suppose him actuated by them and the phenomena besides of the universe will not support us in such a theory all our ideas derived from the senses are confessedly false and illusive and cannot therefore be supposed to have place in a supreme intelligence and as the ideas of internal sentiment added to those of the external senses compose the whole furniture of human understanding we may conclude that none of the materials of thought are in any respect similar in the human and in the divine intelligence now as to the manner of thinking how can we make any comparison between them or suppose them any wise resembling our thought is fluctuating uncertain fleeting successive and compounded and were we to remove these circumstances we absolutely annihilate its essence and it would in such a case be an abuse of terms to apply to it the name of thought or reason at least if it appear more pious and respectful as it really is still to retain these terms when we mention the supreme being we ought to acknowledge that their meaning in that case is totally incomprehensible and that the infirmities of our nature do not permit us to reach any ideas which in the least correspond to the ineffable sublimity of the divine attributes  part iv it seems strange to me said cleanthes that you demea who are so sincere in the cause of religion should still maintain the mysterious incomprehensible nature of the deity and should insist so strenuously that he has no manner of likeness or resemblance to human creatures the deity i can readily allow possesses many powers and attributes of which we can have no comprehension part iv but if our ideas so far as they go be not just and adequate and correspondent to his real nature i know not what there is in this subject worth insisting on is the name without any meaning of such mighty importance or how do you mystics who maintain the absolute incomprehensibility of the deity differ from skeptics or atheists who assert that the first cause of all is unknown and unintelligible their temerity must be very great if after rejecting the production by a mind i mean a mind resembling the human for i know of no other they pretend to assign with certainty any other specific intelligible cause and their conscience must be very scrupulous indeed if they refuse to call the universal unknown cause a god or deity and to bestow on him as many sublime eulogies and unmeaning epithets as you shall please to require of them  who could imagine replied demea that cleanthes the calm philosophical cleanthes would attempt to refute his antagonists by affixing a nickname to them and like the common bigots and inquisitors of the age have recourse to invective and declamation instead of reasoning or does he not perceive that these topics are easily retorted and that anthropomorphite is an appellation as invidious and implies as dangerous consequences as the epithet of mystic with which he has honored us in reality cleanthes consider what it is you assert when you represent the deity as similar to a human mind and understanding what is the soul of man a composition of various faculties passions sentiments ideas united indeed into one self or person but still distinct from each other when it reasons the ideas which are the parts of its discourse arrange themselves in a certain form or order which is not preserved entire for a moment but immediately gives place to another arrangement new opinions new passions new affections new feelings arise which continually diversify the mental scene and produce in it the greatest variety and most rapid succession imaginable how is this compatible with that perfect immutability and simplicity which all true theists ascribe to the deity by the same act say they he sees past present and future his love and his hatred his mercy and his justice are one individual operation he is entire in every point of space and complete in every instant of duration no succession no change no acquisition no diminution what he is implies not in it any shadow of distinction or diversity and what he is this moment he ever has been and ever will be without any new judgment sentiment or operation he stands fixed in one simple perfect state nor can you ever say with any propriety that this act of his is different from that other or that this judgment or idea has been lately formed and will give place by succession to any different judgment or idea  i can readily allow said cleanthes that those who maintain the perfect simplicity of the supreme being to the extent in which you have explained it are complete mystics and chargeable with all the consequences which i have drawn from their opinion they are in a word atheists without knowing it for though it be allowed that the deity possesses attributes of which we have no comprehension yet ought we never to ascribe to him any attributes which are absolutely incompatible with that intelligent nature essential to him a mind whose acts and sentiments and ideas are not distinct and successive one that is wholly simple and totally immutable is a mind which has no thought no reason no will no sentiment no love no hatred or in a word is no mind at all it is an abuse of terms to give it that appellation and we may as well speak of limited extension without figure or of number without composition  pray consider said philo whom you are at present inveighing against you are honoring with the appellation of atheist all the sound orthodox divines almost who have treated of this subject and you will at last be yourself found according to your reckoning the only sound theist in the world but if idolaters be atheists as i think may justly be asserted and christian theologians the same what becomes of the argument so much celebrated derived from the universal consent of mankind  but because i know you are not much swayed by names and authorities i shall endeavor to show you a little more distinctly the inconveniences of that anthropomorphism which you have embraced and shall prove that there is no ground to suppose a plan of the world to be formed in the divine mind consisting of distinct ideas differently arranged in the same manner as an architect forms in his head the plan of a house which he intends to execute  it is not easy i own to see what is gained by this supposition whether we judge of the matter by reason or by experience we are still obliged to mount higher in order to find the cause of this cause which you had assigned as satisfactory and conclusive  if reason i mean abstract reason derived from enquiries a priori be not alike mute with regard to all questions concerning cause and effect this sentence at least it will venture to pronounce that a mental world or universe of ideas requires a cause as much as does a material world or universe of objects and if similar in its arrangement must require a similar cause for what is there in this subject which should occasion a different conclusion or inference in an abstract view they are entirely alike and no difficulty attends the one supposition which is not common to both of them  again when we will needs force experience to pronounce some sentence even on these subjects which lie beyond her sphere neither can she perceive any material difference in this particular between these two kinds of worlds but finds them to be governed by similar principles and to depend upon an equal variety of causes in their operations we have specimens in miniature of both of them our own mind resembles the one a vegetable or animal body the other let experience therefore judge from these samples nothing seems more delicate with regard to its causes than thought and as these causes never operate in two persons after the same manner so we never find two persons who think exactly alike nor indeed does the same person think exactly alike at any two different periods of time a difference of age of the disposition of his body of weather of food of company of books of passions any of these particulars or others more minute are sufficient to alter the curious machinery of thought and communicate to it very different movements and operations as far as we can judge vegetables and animal bodies are not more delicate in their motions nor depend upon a greater variety or more curious adjustment of springs and principles  how therefore shall we satisfy ourselves concerning the cause of that being whom you suppose the author of nature or according to your system of anthropomorphism the ideal world into which you trace the material have we not the same reason to trace that ideal world into another ideal world or new intelligent principle but if we stop and go no farther why go so far why not stop at the material world how can we satisfy ourselves without going on in infinitum and after all what satisfaction is there in that infinite progression let us remember the story of the indian philosopher and his elephant it was never more applicable than to the present subject if the material world rests upon a similar ideal world this ideal world must rest upon some other and so on without end it were better therefore never to look beyond the present material world by supposing it to contain the principle of its order within itself we really assert it to be god and the sooner we arrive at that divine being so much the better when you go one step beyond the mundane system you only excite an inquisitive humor which it is impossible ever to satisfy  to say that the different ideas which compose the reason of the supreme being fall into order of themselves and by their own nature is really to talk without any precise meaning if it has a meaning i would fain know why it is not as good sense to say that the parts of the material world fall into order of themselves and by their own nature can the one opinion be intelligible while the other is not so  we have indeed experience of ideas which fall into order of themselves and without any known cause but i am sure we have a much larger experience of matter which does the same as in all instances of generation and vegetation where the accurate analysis of the cause exceeds all human comprehension we have also experience of particular systems of thought and of matter which have no order of the first in madness of the second in corruption why then should we think that order is more essential to one than the other and if it requires a cause in both what do we gain by your system in tracing the universe of objects into a similar universe of ideas the first step which we make leads us on for ever it were therefore wise in us to limit all our enquiries to the present world without looking farther no satisfaction can ever be attained by these speculations which so far exceed the narrow bounds of human understanding  it was usual with the peripatetics you know cleanthes when the cause of any phenomenon was demanded to have recourse to their faculties or occult qualities and to say for instance that bread nourished by its nutritive faculty and senna purged by its purgative but it has been discovered that this subterfuge was nothing but the disguise of ignorance and that these philosophers though less ingenuous really said the same thing with the skeptics or the vulgar who fairly confessed that they knew not the cause of these phenomena in like manner when it is asked what cause produces order in the ideas of the supreme being can any other reason be assigned by you anthropomorphites than that it is a rational faculty and that such is the nature of the deity but why a similar answer will not be equally satisfactory in accounting for the order of the world without having recourse to any such intelligent creator as you insist on may be difficult to determine it is only to say that such is the nature of material objects and that they are all originally possessed of a faculty of order and proportion these are only more learned and elaborate ways of confessing our ignorance nor has the one hypothesis any real advantage above the other except in its greater conformity to vulgar prejudices  you have displayed this argument with great emphasis replied cleanthes you seem not sensible how easy it is to answer it even in common life if i assign a cause for any event is it any objection philo that i cannot assign the cause of that cause and answer every new question which may incessantly be started and what philosophers could possibly submit to so rigid a rule philosophers who confess ultimate causes to be totally unknown and are sensible that the most refined principles into which they trace the phenomena are still to them as inexplicable as these phenomena themselves are to the vulgar the order and arrangement of nature the curious adjustment of final causes the plain use and intention of every part and organ all these bespeak in the clearest language an intelligent cause or author the heavens and the earth join in the same testimony the whole chorus of nature raises one hymn to the praises of its creator you alone or almost alone disturb this general harmony you start abstruse doubts cavils and objections you ask me what is the cause of this cause i know not i care not that concerns not me i have found a deity and here i stop my enquiry let those go farther who are wiser or more enterprising  i pretend to be neither replied philo and for that very reason i should never perhaps have attempted to go so far especially when i am sensible that i must at last be contented to sit down with the same answer which without farther trouble might have satisfied me from the beginning if i am still to remain in utter ignorance of causes and can absolutely give an explication of nothing i shall never esteem it any advantage to shove off for a moment a difficulty which you acknowledge must immediately in its full force recur upon me naturalists indeed very justly explain particular effects by more general causes though these general causes themselves should remain in the end totally inexplicable but they never surely thought it satisfactory to explain a particular effect by a particular cause which was no more to be accounted for than the effect itself an ideal system arranged of itself without a precedent design is not a whit more explicable than a material one which attains its order in a like manner nor is there any more difficulty in the latter supposition than in the former  part v but to show you still more inconveniences continued philo in your anthropomorphism please to take a new survey of your principles like effects prove like causes this is the experimental argument and this you say too is the sole theological argument now it is certain that the liker the effects are which are seen and the liker the causes which are inferred the stronger is the argument every departure on either side diminishes the probability and renders the experiment less conclusive you cannot doubt of the principle neither ought you to reject its consequences  all the new discoveries in astronomy which prove the immense grandeur and magnificence of the works of nature are so many additional arguments for a deity according to the true system of theism but according to your hypothesis of experimental theism they become so many objections by removing the effect still farther from all resemblance to the effects of human art and contrivance part v for if lucretius lib     0    even following the old system of the world could exclaim quis regere immensi summam quis habere profundi indu manu validas potis est moderanter habenas quis pariter coelos omnes convertere et omnes ignibus aetheriis terras suffire feraces omnibus inque locis esse omni tempore praesto   if tully de not deor lib   esteemed this reasoning so natural as to put it into the mouth of his epicurean quibus euim oculis animi intueri potuit vester plato fabricam illam tanti operis qua construi a deo atque aedificari mundum facit quae molitio quae ferramenta qui vectes quae machinae qui ministri tanti muneris fuerunt quemadmodum autem obedire et parere voluntati architecti aer ignis aqua terra potuerunt if this argument i say had any force in former ages how much greater must it have at present when the bounds of nature are so infinitely enlarged and such a magnificent scene is opened to us it is still more unreasonable to form our idea of so unlimited a cause from our experience of the narrow productions of human design and invention  the discoveries by microscopes as they open a new universe in miniature are still objections according to you arguments according to me the farther we push our researches of this kind we are still led to infer the universal cause of all to be vastly different from mankind or from any object of human experience and observation  and what say you to the discoveries in anatomy chemistry botany  these surely are no objections replied cleanthes they only discover new instances of art and contrivance it is still the image of mind reflected on us from innumerable objects add a mind like the human said philo i know of no other replied cleanthes and the liker the better insisted philo to be sure said cleanthes  now cleanthes said philo with an air of alacrity and triumph mark the consequences first by this method of reasoning you renounce all claim to infinity in any of the attributes of the deity for as the cause ought only to be proportioned to the effect and the effect so far as it falls under our cognizance is not infinite what pretensions have we upon your suppositions to ascribe that attribute to the divine being you will still insist that by removing him so much from all similarity to human creatures we give into the most arbitrary hypothesis and at the same time weaken all proofs of his existence  secondly you have no reason on your theory for ascribing perfection to the deity even in his finite capacity or for supposing him free from every error mistake or incoherence in his undertakings there are many inexplicable difficulties in the works of nature which if we allow a perfect author to be proved a priori are easily solved and become only seeming difficulties from the narrow capacity of man who cannot trace infinite relations but according to your method of reasoning these difficulties become all real and perhaps will be insisted on as new instances of likeness to human art and contrivance at least you must acknowledge that it is impossible for us to tell from our limited views whether this system contains any great faults or deserves any considerable praise if compared to other possible and even real systems could a peasant if the aeneid were read to him pronounce that poem to be absolutely faultless or even assign to it its proper rank among the productions of human wit he who had never seen any other production  but were this world ever so perfect a production it must still remain uncertain whether all the excellencies of the work can justly be ascribed to the workman if we survey a ship what an exalted idea must we form of the ingenuity of the carpenter who framed so complicated useful and beautiful a machine and what surprise must we feel when we find him a stupid mechanic who imitated others and copied an art which through a long succession of ages after multiplied trials mistakes corrections deliberations and controversies had been gradually improving many worlds might have been botched and bungled throughout an eternity ere this system was struck out much labor lost many fruitless trials made and a slow but continued improvement carried on during infinite ages in the art of worldmaking in such subjects who can determine where the truth nay who can conjecture where the probability lies amidst a great number of hypotheses which may be proposed and a still greater number which may be imagined  and what shadow of an argument continued philo can you produce from your hypothesis to prove the unity of the deity a great number of men join in building a house or ship in rearing a city in framing a commonwealth why may not several deities combine in contriving and framing a world this is only so much greater similarity to human affairs by sharing the work among several we may so much farther limit the attributes of each and get rid of that extensive power and knowledge which must be supposed in one deity and which according to you can only serve to weaken the proof of his existence and if such foolish such vicious creatures as man can yet often unite in framing and executing one plan how much more those deities or demons whom we may suppose several degrees more perfect  to multiply causes without necessity is indeed contrary to true philosophy but this principle applies not to the present case were one deity antecedently proved by your theory who were possessed of every attribute requisite to the production of the universe it would be needless i own though not absurd to suppose any other deity existent but while it is still a question whether all these attributes are united in one subject or dispersed among several independent beings by what phenomena in nature can we pretend to decide the controversy where we see a body raised in a scale we are sure that there is in the opposite scale however concealed from sight some counterpoising weight equal to it but it is still allowed to doubt whether that weight be an aggregate of several distinct bodies or one uniform united mass and if the weight requisite very much exceeds any thing which we have ever seen conjoined in any single body the former supposition becomes still more probable and natural an intelligent being of such vast power and capacity as is necessary to produce the universe or to speak in the language of ancient philosophy so prodigious an animal exceeds all analogy and even comprehension  but farther cleanthes men are mortal and renew their species by generation and this is common to all living creatures the two great sexes of male and female says milton animate the world why must this circumstance so universal so essential be excluded from those numerous and limited deities behold then the theogony of ancient times brought back upon us  and why not become a perfect anthropomorphite why not assert the deity or deities to be corporeal and to have eyes a nose mouth ears etc epicurus maintained that no man had ever seen reason but in a human figure therefore the gods must have a human figure and this argument which is deservedly so much ridiculed by cicero becomes according to you solid and philosophical  in a word cleanthes a man who follows your hypothesis is able perhaps to assert or conjecture that the universe sometime arose from something like design but beyond that position he cannot ascertain one single circumstance and is left afterward to fix every point of his theology by the utmost license of fancy and hypothesis this world for aught he knows is very faulty and imperfect compared to a superior standard and was only the first rude essay of some infant deity who afterward abandoned it ashamed of his lame performance it is the work only of some dependent inferior deity and is the object of derision to his superiors it is the production of old age and dotage in some superannuated deity and ever since his death has run on at adventures from the first impulse and active force which it received from him you justly give signs of horror demea at these strange suppositions but these and a thousand more of the same kind are cleanthess suppositions not mine from the moment the attributes of the deity are supposed finite all these have place and i cannot for my part think that so wild and unsettled a system of theology is in any respect preferable to none at all  these suppositions i absolutely disown cried cleanthes they strike me however with no horror especially when proposed in that rambling way in which they drop from you on the contrary they give me pleasure when i see that by the utmost indulgence of your imagination you never get rid of the hypothesis of design in the universe but are obliged at every turn to have recourse to it to this concession i adhere steadily and this i regard as a sufficient foundation for religion  part vi it must be a slight fabric indeed said demea which can be erected on so tottering a foundation while we are uncertain whether there is one deity or many whether the deity or deities to whom we owe our existence be perfect or imperfect subordinate or supreme dead or alive what trust or confidence can we repose in them what devotion or worship address to them what veneration or obedience pay them to all the purposes of life the theory of religion becomes altogether useless part vi and even with regard to speculative consequences its uncertainty according to you must render it totally precarious and unsatisfactory  to render it still more unsatisfactory said philo there occurs to me another hypothesis which must acquire an air of probability from the method of reasoning so much insisted on by cleanthes that like effects arise from like causes this principle he supposes the foundation of all religion but there is another principle of the same kind no less certain and derived from the same source of experience that where several known circumstances are observed to be similar the unknown will also be found similar thus if we see the limbs of a human body we conclude that it is also attended with a human head though hid from us thus if we see through a chink in a wall a small part of the sun we conclude that were the wall removed we should see the whole body in short this method of reasoning is so obvious and familiar that no scruple can ever be made with regard to its solidity  now if we survey the universe so far as it falls under our knowledge it bears a great resemblance to an animal or organized body and seems actuated with a like principle of life and motion a continual circulation of matter in it produces no disorder a continual waste in every part is incessantly repaired the closest sympathy is perceived throughout the entire system and each part or member in performing its proper offices operates both to its own preservation and to that of the whole the world therefore i infer is an animal and the deity is the soul of the world actuating it and actuated by it  you have too much learning cleanthes to be at all surprised at this opinion which you know was maintained by almost all the theists of antiquity and chiefly prevails in their discourses and reasonings for though sometimes the ancient philosophers reason from final causes as if they thought the world the workmanship of god yet it appears rather their favorite notion to consider it as his body whose organization renders it subservient to him and it must be confessed that as the universe resembles more a human body than it does the works of human art and contrivance if our limited analogy could ever with any propriety be extended to the whole of nature the inference seems juster in favor of the ancient than the modern theory  there are many other advantages too in the former theory which recommended it to the ancient theologians nothing more repugnant to all their notions because nothing more repugnant to common experience than mind without body a mere spiritual substance which fell not under their senses nor comprehension and of which they had not observed one single instance throughout all nature mind and body they knew because they felt both an order arrangement organization or internal machinery in both they likewise knew after the same manner and it could not but seem reasonable to transfer this experience to the universe and to suppose the divine mind and body to be also coeval and to have both of them order and arrangement naturally inherent in them and inseparable from them  here therefore is a new species of anthropomorphism cleanthes on which you may deliberate and a theory which seems not liable to any considerable difficulties you are too much superior surely to systematical prejudices to find any more difficulty in supposing an animal body to be originally of itself or from unknown causes possessed of order and organization than in supposing a similar order to belong to mind but the vulgar prejudice that body and mind ought always to accompany each other ought not one should think to be entirely neglected since it is founded on vulgar experience the only guide which you profess to follow in all these theological enquiries and if you assert that our limited experience is an unequal standard by which to judge of the unlimited extent of nature you entirely abandon your own hypothesis and must thenceforward adopt our mysticism as you call it and admit of the absolute incomprehensibility of the divine nature  this theory i own replied cleanthes has never before occurred to me though a pretty natural one and i cannot readily upon so short an examination and reflection deliver any opinion with regard to it you are very scrupulous indeed said philo were i to examine any system of yours i should not have acted with half that caution and reserve in starting objections and difficulties to it however if any thing occur to you you will oblige us by proposing it  why then replied cleanthes it seems to me that though the world does in many circumstances resemble an animal body yet is the analogy also defective in many circumstances the most material no organs of sense no seat of thought or reason no one precise origin of motion and action in short it seems to bear a stronger resemblance to a vegetable than to an animal and your inference would be so far inconclusive in favor of the soul of the world  but in the next place your theory seems to imply the eternity of the world and that is a principle which i think can be refuted by the strongest reasons and probabilities i shall suggest an argument to this purpose which i believe has not been insisted on by any writer those who reason from the late origin of arts and sciences though their inference wants not force may perhaps be refuted by considerations derived from the nature of human society which is in continual revolution between ignorance and knowledge liberty and slavery riches and poverty so that it is impossible for us from our limited experience to foretell with assurance what events may or may not be expected ancient learning and history seem to have been in great danger of entirely perishing after the inundation of the barbarous nations and had these convulsions continued a little longer or been a little more violent we should not probably have now known what passed in the world a few centuries before us nay were it not for the superstition of the popes who preserved a little jargon of latin in order to support the appearance of an ancient and universal church that tongue must have been utterly lost in which case the western world being totally barbarous would not have been in a fit disposition for receiving the greek language and learning which was conveyed to them after the sacking of constantinople when learning and books had been extinguished even the mechanical arts would have fallen considerably to decay and it is easily imagined that fable or tradition might ascribe to them a much later origin than the true one this vulgar argument therefore against the eternity of the world seems a little precarious  but here appears to be the foundation of a better argument lucullus was the first that brought cherrytrees from asia to europe though that tree thrives so well in many european climates that it grows in the woods without any culture is it possible that throughout a whole eternity no european had ever passed into asia and thought of transplanting so delicious a fruit into his own country or if the tree was once transplanted and propagated how could it ever afterward perish empires may rise and fall liberty and slavery succeed alternately ignorance and knowledge give place to each other but the cherrytree will still remain in the woods of greece spain and italy and will never be affected by the revolutions of human society  it is not two thousand years since vines were transplanted into france though there is no climate in the world more favorable to them it is not three centuries since horses cows sheep swine dogs corn were known in america is it possible that during the revolutions of a whole eternity there never arose a columbus who might open the communication between europe and that continent we may as well imagine that all men would wear stockings for ten thousand years and never have the sense to think of garters to tie them all these seem convincing proofs of the youth or rather infancy of the world as being founded on the operation of principles more constant and steady than those by which human society is governed and directed nothing less than a total convulsion of the elements will ever destroy all the european animals and vegetables which are now to be found in the western world  and what argument have you against such convulsions replied philo strong and almost incontestable proofs may be traced over the whole earth that every part of this globe has continued for many ages entirely covered with water and though order were supposed inseparable from matter and inherent in it yet may matter be susceptible of many and great revolutions through the endless periods of eternal duration the incessant changes to which every part of it is subject seem to intimate some such general transsormations though at the same time it is observable that all the changes and corruptions of which we have ever had experience are but passages from one state of order to another nor can matter ever rest in total deformity and confusion what we see in the parts we may infer in the whole at least that is the method of reasoning on which you rest your whole theory and were i obliged to defend any particular system of this nature which i never willingly should do i esteem none more plausible than that which ascribes an eternal inherent principle of order to the world though attended with great and continual revolutions and alterations this at once solves all difficulties and if the solution by being so general is not entirely complete and satisfactory it is at least a theory that we must sooner or later have recourse to whatever system we embrace how could things have been as they are were there not an original inherent principle of order somewhere in thought or in matter and it is very indifferent to which of these we give the preference chance has no place on any hypothesis skeptical or religious every thing is surely governed by steady inviolable laws and were the inmost essence of things laid open to us we should then discover a scene of which at present we can have no idea instead of admiring the order of natural beings we should clearly see that it was absolutely impossible for them in the smallest article ever to admit of any other disposition  were any one inclined to revive the ancient pagan theology which maintained as we learn from hesiod that this globe was governed by  0000 deities who arose from the unknown powers of nature you would naturally object cleanthes that nothing is gained by this hypothesis and that it is as easy to suppose all men and animals beings more numerous but less perfect to have sprung immediately from a like origin push the same inference a step farther and you will find a numerous society of deities as explicable as one universal deity who possesses within himself the powers and perfections of the whole society all these systems then of skepticism polytheism and theism you must allow on your principles to be on a like footing and that no one of them has any advantages over the others you may thence learn the fallacy of your principles  part vii but here part vii continued philo in examining the ancient system of the soul of the world there strikes me all on a sudden a new idea which if just must go near to subvert all your reasoning and destroy even your first inferences on which you repose such confidence if the universe bears a greater likeness to animal bodies and to vegetables than to the works of human art it is more probable that its cause resembles the cause of the former than that of the latter and its origin ought rather to be ascribed to generation or vegetation than to reason or design your conclusion even according to your own principles is therefore lame and defective  pray open up this argument a little farther said demea for i do not rightly apprehend it in that concise manner in which you have expressed it  our friend cleanthes replied philo as you have heard asserts that since no question of fact can be proved otherwise than by experience the existence of a deity admits not of proof from any other medium the world says he resembles the works of human contrivance therefore its cause must also resemble that of the other here we may remark that the operation of one very small part of nature to wit man upon another very small part to wit that inanimate matter lying within his reach is the rule by which cleanthes judges of the origin of the whole and he measures objects so widely disproportioned by the same individual standard but to wave all objections drawn from this topic i affirm that there are other parts of the universe besides the machines of human invention which bear still a greater resemblance to the fabric of the world and which therefore afford a better conjecture concerning the universal origin of this system these parts are animals and vegetables the world plainly resembles more an animal or a vegetable than it does a watch or a knittingloom its cause therefore it is more probable resembles the cause of the former the cause of the former is generation or vegetation the cause therefore of the world we may infer to be something similar or analagous to generation or vegetation  but how is it conceivable said demea that the world can arise from any thing similar to vegetation or generation  very easily replied philo in like manner as a tree sheds its seed into the neighboring fields and produces other trees so the great vegetable the world or this planetary system produces within itself certain seeds which being scattered into the surrounding chaos vegetate into new worlds a comet for instance is the seed of a world and after it has been fully ripened by passing from sun to sun and star to star it is at last tossed into the unformed elements which every where surround this universe and immedialy sprouts up into a new system  or if for the sake of variety for i see no other advantage we should suppose this world to be an animal a comet is the egg of this animal and in like manner as an ostrich lays its egg in the sand which without any farther care hatches the egg and produces a new animal soi understand you says demea but what wild arbitrary suppositions are these what data have you for such extraordinary conclusions and is the slight imaginary resemblance of the world to a vegetable or an animal sufficient to establish the same inference with regard to both objects which are in general so widely different ought they to be a standard for each other  right cries philo this is the topic on which i have all along insisted i have still asserted that we have no data to establish any system of cosmogony our experience so imperfect in itself and so limited both in extent and duration can afford us no probable conjecture concerning the whole of things but if we must needs fix on some hypothesis by what rule pray ought we to determine our choice is there any other rule than the greater similarity of the objects compared and does not a plant or an animal which springs from vegetation or generation bear a stronger resemblance to the world than does any artificial machine which arises from reason and design  but what is this vegetation and generation of which you talk said demea can you explain their operations and anatomize that fine internal structure on which they depend  as much at least replied philo as cleanthes can explain the operations of reason or anatomize that internal structure on which it depends but without any such elaborate disquisitions when i see an animal i infer that it sprang from generation and that with as great certainty as you conclude a house to have been reared by design these words generation reason mark only certain powers and energies in nature whose effects are known but whose essence is incomprehensible and one of these principles more than the other has no privilege for being made a standard to the whole of nature  in reality demea it may reasonably be expected that the larger the views are which we take of things the better will they conduct us in our conclusions concerning such extraordinary and such magnificent subjects in this little corner of the world alone there are four principles reason instinct generation vegetation which are similar to each other and are the causes of similar effects what a number of other principles may we naturally suppose in the immense extent and variety of the universe could we travel from planet to planet and from system to system in order to examine each part of this mighty fabric any one of these four principles above mentioned and a hundred others which lie open to our conjecture may afford us a theory by which to judge of the origin of the world and it is a palpable and egregious partiality to confine our view entirely to that principle by which our own minds operate were this principle more intelligible on that account such a partiality might be somewhat excuseable but reason in its internal fabric and structure is really as little known to us as instinct or vegetation and perhaps even that vague undeterminate word nature to which the vulgar refer every thing is not at the bottom more inexplicable the effects of these principles are all known to us from experience but the principles themselves and their manner of operation are totally unknown not is it less intelligible or less conformable to experience to say that the world arose by vegetation from a seed shed by another world than to say that it arose from a divine reason or contrivance according to the sense in which cleanthes understands it  but methinks said demea if the world had a vegetative quality and could sow the seeds of new worlds into the infinite chaos this power would be still an additional argument for design in its author for whence could arise so wonderful a faculty but from design or how can order spring from any thing which perceives not that order which it bestows  you need only look around you replied philo to satisfy yourself with regard to this question a tree bestows order and organization on that tree which springs from it without knowing the order an animal in the same manner on its offspring a bird on its nest and instances of this kind are even more frequent in the world than those of order which arise from reason and contrivance to say that all this order in animals and vegetables proceeds ultimately from design is begging the question nor can that great point be ascertained otherwise than by proving a priori both that order is from its nature inseparably attached to thought and that it can never of itself or from original unknown principles belong to matter  but farther demea this objection which you urge can never be made use of by cleanthes without renouncing a defense which he has already made against one of my objections when i enquired concerning the cause of that supreme reason and intelligence into which he resolves every thing he told me that the impossibility of satisfying such enquiries could never be admitted as an objection in any species of philosophy we must stop somewhere says he nor is it ever within the reach of human capacity to explain ultimate causes or show the last connections of any objects it is sufficient if the steps so far as we go are supported by experience and observation now that vegetation and generation as well as reason are experienced to be principles of order in nature is undeniable if i rest my system of cosmogony on the former preferably to the latter it is at my choice the matter seems entirely arbitrary and when cleanthes asks me what is the cause of my great vegetative or generative faculty i am equally entitled to ask him the cause of his great reasoning principle these questions we have agreed to forbear on both sides and it is chiefly his interest on the present occasion to stick to this agreement judging by our limited and imperfect experience generation has some privileges above reason for we see every day the latter arise from the former never the former from the latter  compare i beseech you the consequences on both sides the world say i resembles an animal therefore it is an animal therefore it arose from generation the steps i confess are wide yet there is some small appearance of analogy in each step the world says cleanthes resembles a machine therefore it is a machine therefore it arose from design the steps here are equally wide and the analogy less striking and if he pretends to carry on my hypothesis a step farther and to infer design or reason from the great principle of generation on which i insist i may with better authority use the same freedom to push farther his hypothesis and infer a divine generation or theogony from his principle of reason i have at least some faint shadow of experience which is the utmost that can ever be attained in the present subject reason in innumerable instances is observed to arise from the principle of generation and never to arise from any other principle  hesiod and all the ancient mythologists were so struck with this analogy that they universally explained the origin of nature from an animal birth and copulation plato too so far as he is intelligible seems to have adopted some such notion in his timaeus  the bramins assert that the world arose from an insinite spider who spun this whole complicated mass from his bowels and annihilates afterward the whole or any part of it by absorbing it again and resolving it into his own essence here is a species of cosmogony which appears to us ridiculous because a spider is a little contemptible animal whose operations we are never likely to take for a model of the whole universe but still here is a new species of analogy even in our globe and were there a planet wholly inhabited by spiders which is very possible this inference would there appear as natural and irrefragable as that which in our planet ascribes the origin of all things to design and intelligence as explained by cleanthes why an orderly system may not be spun from the belly as well as from the brain it will be difficult for him to give a satisfactory reason  i must confess philo replied cleanthes that of all men living the task which you have undertaken of raising doubts and objections suits you best and seems in a manner natural and unavoidable to you so great is your fertility of invention that i am not ashamed to acknowledge myself unable on a sudden to solve regularly such outoftheway difficulties as you incessantly start upon me though i clearly see in general their fallacy and error and i question not but you are yourself at present in the same case and have not the solution so ready as the objection while you must be sensible that common sense and reason is entirely against you and that such whimsies as you have delivered may puzzle but never can convince us  part viii what you ascribe to the fertility of my invention replied philo is entirely owing to the nature of the subject in subjects adapted to the narrow compass of human reason there is commonly but one determination which carries probability or conviction with it and to a man of sound judgment all other suppositions but that one appear entirely absurd and chimerical but in such questions as the present a hundred contradictory views may preserve a kind of imperfect analogy part viii and invention has here full scope to exert itself without any great effort of thought i believe that i could in an instant propose other systems of cosmogony which would have some faint appearance of truth though it is a thousand a million to one if either yours or any one of mine be the true system  for instance what if i should revive the old epicurean hypothesis this is commonly and i believe justly esteemed the most absurd system that has yet been proposed yet i know not whether with a few alterations it might not be brought to bear a faint appearance of probability instead of supposing matter infinite as epicurus did let us suppose it finite a finite number of particles is only susceptible of finite transpositions and it must happen in an eternal duration that every possible order or position must be tried an infinite number of times this world therefore with all its events even the most minute has before been produced and destroyed and will again be produced and destroyed without any bounds and limitations no one who has a conception of the powers of infinite in comparison of finite will ever scruple this determination  but this supposes said demea that matter can acquire motion without any voluntary agent or first mover  and where is the difficulty replied philo of that supposition every event before experience is equally difficult and incomprehensible and every event after experience is equally easy and intelligible motion in many instances from gravity from elasticity from electricity begins in matter without any known voluntary agent and to suppose always in these cases an unknown voluntary agent is mere hypothesis and hypothesis attended with no advantages the beginning of motion in matter itself is as conceivable a priori as its communication from mind and intelligence  besides why may not motion have been propagated by impulse through all eternity and the same stock of it or nearly the same be still upheld in the universe as much as is lost by the composition of motion as much is gained by its resolution and whatever the causes are the fact is certain that matter is and always has been in continual agitation as far as human experience or tradition reaches there is not probably at present in the whole universe one particle of matter at absolute rest  and this very consideration too continued philo which we have stumbled on in the course of the argument suggests a new hypothesis of cosmogony that is not absolutely absurd and improbable is there a system an order an economy of things by which matter can preserve that perpetual agitation which seems essential to it and yet maintain a constancy in the forms which it produces there certainly is such an economy for this is actually the case with the present world the continual motion of matter therefore in less than infinite transpositions must produce this economy or order and by its very nature that order when once established supports itself for many ages if not to eternity but wherever matter is so poized arranged and adjusted as to continue in perpetual motion and yet preserve a constancy in the forms its situation must of necessity have all the same appearance of art and contrivance which we observe at present all the parts of each form must have a relation to each other and to the whole and the whole itself must have a relation to the other parts of the universe to the element in which the form subsists to the materials with which it repairs its waste and decay and to every other form which is hostile or friendly a defect in any of these particulars destroys the form and the matter of which it is composed is again set loose and is thrown into irregular motions and fermentations till it unite itself to some other regular form if no such form be prepared to receive it and if there be a great quantity of this corrupted matter in the universe the universe itself is entirely disordered whether it be the feeble embryo of a world in its first beginnings that is thus destroyed or the rotten carcass of one languishing in old age and infirmity in either case a chaos ensues till finite though innumerable revolutions produce at last some forms whose parts and organs are so adjusted as to support the forms amidst a continued succession of matter  suppose for we shall endeavor to vary the expression that matter were thrown into any position by a blind unguided force it is evident that this first position must in all probability be the most confused and most disorderly imaginable without any resemblance to those works of human contrivance which along with a symmetry of parts discover an adjustment of means to ends and a tendency to selfpreservation if the actuating force cease after this operation matter must remain for ever in disorder and continue an immense chaos without any proportion or activity but suppose that the actuating force whatever it be still continues in matter this first position will immediately give place to a second which will likewise in all probability be as disorderly as the first and so on through many successions of changes and revolutions no particular order or position ever continues a moment unaltered the original force still remaining in activity gives a perpetual restlessness to matter every possible situation is produced and instantly destroyed if a glimpse or dawn of order appears for a moment it is instantly hurried away and confounded by that neverceasing force which actuates every part of matter  thus the universe goes on for many ages in a continued succession of chaos and disorder but is it not possible that it may settle at last so as not to lose its motion and active force for that we have supposed inherent in it yet so as to preserve an uniformity of appearance amidst the continual motion and fluctuation of its parts this we find to be the case with the universe at present every individual is perpetually changing and every part of every individual and yet the whole remains in appearance the same may we not hope for such a position or rather be assured of it from the eternal revolutions of unguided matter and may not this account for all the appearing wisdom and contrivance which is in the universe let us contemplate the subject a little and we shall find that this adjustment if attained by matter of a seeming stability in the forms with a real and perpetual revolution or motion of parts affords a plausible if not a true solution of the difficulty  it is in vain therefore to insist upon the uses of the parts in animals or vegetables and their curious adjustment to each other i would fain know how an animal could subsist unless its parts were so adjusted do we not find that it immediately perishes whenever this adjustment ceases and that its matter corrupting tries some new form it happens indeed that the parts of the world are so well adjusted that some regular form immediately lays claim to this corrupted matter and if it were not so could the world subsist must it not dissolve as well as the animal and pass through new positions and situations till in a great but finite succession it fall at last into the present or some such order  it is well replied cleanthes you told us that this hypothesis was suggested on a sudden in the course of the argument had you had leisure to examine it you would soon have perceived the insuperable objections to which it is exposed no form you say can subsist unless it possess those powers and organs requisite for its subsistence some new order or economy must be tried and so on without intermission till at last some order which can support and maintain itself is fallen upon but according to this hypothesis whence arise the many conveniences and advantages which men and all animals possess two eyes two ears are not absolutely necessary for the subsistence of the species human race might have been propagated and preserved without horses dogs cows sheep and those innumerable fruits and products which serve to our satisfaction and enjoyment if no camels had been created for the use of man in the sandy deserts of africa and arabia would the world have been dissolved if no loadstone had been framed to give that wonderful and useful direction to the needle would human society and the human kind have been immediately extinguished though the maxims of nature be in general very frugal yet instances of this kind are far from being rare and any one of them is a sufficient proof of design and of a benevolent design which gave rise to the order and arrangement of the universe  at least you may safely infer said philo that the foregoing hypothesis is so far incomplete and imperfect which i shall not scruple to allow but can we ever reasonably expect greater success in any attempts of this nature or can we ever hope to erect a system of cosmogony that will be liable to no exceptions and will contain no circumstance repugnant to our limited and imperfect experience of the analogy of nature your theory itself cannot surely pretend to any such advantage even though you have run into authropomorphism the better to preserve a conformity to common experience let us once more put it to trial in all instances which we have ever seen ideas are copied from real objects and are ectypal not archetypal to express myself in learned terms you reverse this order and give thought the precedence in all instances which we have ever seen thought has no influence upon matter except where that matter is so conjoined with it as to have an equal reciprocal influence upon it no animal can move immediately any thing but the members of its own body and indeed the equality of action and reaction seems to be an universal law of nature but your theory implies a contradiction to this experience these instances with many more which it were easy to collect particularly the supposition of a mind or system of thought that is eternal or in other words an animal ingenerable and immortal these instances i say may teach all of us sobriety in condemning each other and let us see that as no system of this kind ought ever to be received from a slight analogy so neither ought any to be rejected on account of a small incongruity for that is an inconvenience from which we can justly pronounce no one to be exempted  all religious systems it is confessed are subject to great and insuperable difficulties each disputant triumphs in his turn while he carries on an offensive war and exposes the absurdities barbarities and pernicious tenets of his antagonist but all of them on the whole prepare a complete triumph for the skeptic who tells them that no system ought ever to be embraced with regard to such subjects for this plain reason that no absurdity ought ever to be assented to with regard to any subject a total suspense of judgment is here our only reasonable resource and if every attack as is commonly observed and no defense among theologians is successful how complete must be his victory who remains always with all mankind on the offensive and has himself no fixed station or abiding city which he is ever on any occasion obliged to desend  part ix but if so many difficulties attend the argument a posteriori part ix said demea had we not better adhere to that simple and sublime argument a priori which by offering to us infallible demonstration cuts off at once all doubt and difficulty by this argument too we may prove the infinity of the divine attributes which i am afraid can never be ascertained with certainty from any other topic for how can an effect which either is finite or for aught we know may be so how can such an effect i say prove an infinite cause the unity too of the divine nature it is very difficult if not absolutely impossible to deduce merely from contemplating the works of nature nor will the uniformity alone of the plan even were it allowed give us any assurance of that attribute whereas the argument a priori  you seem to reason demea interposed cleanthes as if those advantages and conveniences in the abstract argument were full proofs of its solidity but it is first proper in my opinion to determine what argument of this nature you choose to insist on and we shall afterward from itself better than from its useful consequences endeavor to determine what value we ought to put upon it  the argument replied demea which i would insist on is the common one whatever exists must have a cause or reason of its existence it being absolutely impossible for any thing thing to produce itself or be the cause of its own existence in mounting up therefore from effects to causes we must either go on in tracing an infinite succession without any ultimate cause at all or must at last have recourse to some ultimate cause that is necessarily existent now that the first supposition is absurd may be thus proved in the infinite chain or succession of causes and effects each single effect is determined to exist by the power and efficacy of that cause which immediately preceded but the whole eternal chain or succession taken together is not determined or caused by any thing and yet it is evident that it requires a cause or reason as much as any particular object which begins to exist in time the question is still reasonable why this particular succession of causes existed from eternity and not any other succession or no succession at all if there be no necessarilyexistent being any supposition which can be formed is equally possible nor is there any more absurdity in nothings having existed from eternity than there is in that succession of causes which constitutes the universe what was it then which determined something to exist rather than nothing and bestowed being on a particular possibility exclusive of the rest external causes there are supposed to be none chance is a word without a meaning was it nothing but that can never produce any thing we must therefore have recourse to a necessarilyexistent being who carries the reason of his existence in himself and who cannot be supposed not to exist without an express contradiction there is consequently such a being that is there is a deity  i shall not leave it to philo said cleanthes though i know that the starting objections is his chief delight to point out the weakness of this metaphysical reasoning it seems to me so obviously illgrounded and at the same time of so little consequence to the cause of true piety and religion that i shall myself venture to show the fallacy of it  i shall begin with observing that there is an evident absurdity in pretending to demonstrate a matter of fact or to prove it by any arguments a priori nothing is demonstrable unless the contrary implies a contradiction nothing that is distinctly conceivable implies a contradiction whatever we conceive as existent we can also conceive as nonexistent there is no being therefore whose nonexistence implies a contradiction consequently there is no being whose existence is demonstrable i propose this argument as entirely decisive and am willing to rest the whole controversy upon it  it is pretended that the deity is a necessarilyexistent existent being and this necessity of his existence is attempted to be explained by asserting that if we knew his whole essence or nature we should perceive it to be as impossible for him not to exist as for twice two not to be four but it is evident that this can never happen while our faculties remain the same as at present it will still be possible for us at any time to conceive the nonexistence of what we formerly conceived to exist nor can the mind ever lie under a necessity of supposing any object to remain always in being in the same manner as we lie under a necessity of always conceiving twice two to be four the words therefore necessary existence have no meaning or which is the same thing none that is consistent  but farther why may not the material universe be the necessarilyexistent being according to this pretended explication of necessity we dare not affirm that we know all the qualities of matter and for aught we can determine it may contain some qualities which were they known would make its nonexistence appear as great a contradiction as that twice two is five i find only one argument employed to prove that the material world is not the necessarilyexistent being and this argument is derived from the contingency both of the matter and the form of the world any particle of matter it is said dr clarke may be conceived to be annihilated and any form may be conceived to be altered such an annihilation or alteration therefore is not impossible but it seems a great partiality not to perceive that the same argument extends equally to the deity so far as we have any conception of him and that the mind can at least imagine him to be nonexistent or his attributes to be altered it must be some unknown inconceivable qualities which can make his nonexistence appear impossible or his attributes unalterable and no reason can be assigned why these qualities may not belong to matter as they are altogether unknown and inconceivable they can never be proved incompatible with it  add to this that in tracing an eternal succession of objects it seems absurd to enquire for a general cause or first author how can any thing that exists from eternity have a cause since that relation implies a priority in time and a beginning of existence  in such a chain too or succession of objects each part is caused by that which preceded it and causes that which succeeds it where then is the difficulty but the whole you say wants a cause i answer that the uniting of these parts into a whole like the uniting of several distinct counties into one kingdom or several distinct members into one body is performed merely by an arbitrary act of the mind and has no influence on the nature of things did i show you the particular causes of each individual in a collection of twenty particles of matter i should think it very unreasonable should you afterward ask me what was the cause of the whole twenty that is sufficiently explained in explaining the cause of the parts  though the reasonings which you have urged cleanthes may well excuse me said philo from starting any farther difficulties yet i cannot forbear insisting still upon another topic it is observed by arithmeticians that the products of   compose always either   or some lesser product of   if you add together all the characters of which any of the former products is composed thus of          which are products of   you make   by adding   to     to     to   thus     is a product also of   and if you add     and   you make    a lesser product of   republique des lettres aout       to a superficial observer so wonderful a regularity may be admired as the effect either of chance or design but a skilful algebraist immediately concludes it to be the work of necessity and demonstrates that it must for ever result from the nature of these numbers is it not probable i ask that the whole economy of the universe is conducted by a like necessity though no human algebra can furnish a key which solves the difficulty and instead of admiring the order of natural beings may it not happen that could we penetrate into the intimate nature of bodies we should clearly see why it was absolutely impossible they could ever admit of any other disposition so dangerous is it to introduce this idea of necessity into the present question and so naturally does it afford an inference directly opposite to the religious hypothesis  but dropping all these abstractions continued philo and confining ourselves to more familiar topics i shall venture to add an observation that the argument a priori has seldom been found very convincing except to people of a metaphysical head who have accustomed themselves to abstract reasoning and who finding from mathematics that the understanding frequently leads to truth through obscurity and contrary to first appearances have transferred the same habit of thinking to subjects where it ought not to have place other people even of good sense and the best inclined to religion feel always some deficiency in such arguments though they are not perhaps able to explain distinctly where it lies a certain proof that men ever did and ever will derive their religion from other sources than from this species of reasoning  part x it is my opinion i own replied demea that each man feels in a manner the truth of religion within his own breast and from a consciousness of his imbecility and misery part x rather than from any reasoning is led to seek protection from that being on whom he and all nature is dependent so anxious or so tedious are even the best seenes of life that futurity is still the object of all our hopes and fears we incessantly look forward and endeavor by prayers adoration and sacrifice to appease those unknown powers whom we find by experience so able to afflict and oppress us wretched creatures that we are what resource for us amidst the innumerable ills of life did not religion suggest some methods of atonement and appease those terrors with which we are incessantly agitated and tormented  i am indeed persuaded said philo that the best and indeed the only method of bringing every one to a due sense of religion is by just representations of the misery and wickedness of men and for that purpose a talent of eloquence and strong imagery is more requisite than that of reasoning and argument for is it necessary to prove what every one feels within himself it is only necessary to make us feel it if possible more intimately and sensibly  the people indeed replied demea are sufficiently convinced of this great and melancholy truth the miseries of life the unhappiness of man the general corruptions of our nature the unsatisfactory enjoyment of pleasures riches honors these phrases have become almost proverbial in all languages and who can doubt of what all men declare from their own immediate feeling and experience  in this point said philo the learned are perfectly agreed with the vulgar and in all letters sacred and profane the topic of human misery has been insisted on with the most pathetic eloquence that sorrow and melancholy could inspire the poets who speak from sentiment without a system and whose testimony has therefore the more authority abound in images of this nature from homer down to dr young the whole inspired tribe have ever been sensible that no other representation of things would suit the feeling and observation of each individual  as to authorities replied demea you need not seek them look round this library of cleanthes i shall venture to affirm that except authors of particular sciences such as chemistry or botany who have no occasion to treat of human life there is scarce one of those innumerable writers from whom the sense of human misery has not in some passage or other extorted a complaint and confession of it at least the chance is entirely on that side and no one author has ever so far as i can recollect been so extravagant as to deny it  there you must excuse me said philo leibnitz has denied it and is perhaps the first that sentiment had been maintained by dr king and some few others before leibnitz though by none of so great fame as that german philosopher  who ventured upon so bold and paradoxical an opinion at least the first who made it essential to his philosophical system  and by being the first replied demea might he not have been sensible of his error for is this a subject in which philosophers can propose to make discoveries especially in so late an age and can any man hope by a simple denial for the subject scarcely admits of reasoning to bear down the united testimony of mankind founded on sense and consciousness  and why should man added he pretend to an exemption from the lot of all other animals the whole earth believe me philo is cursed and polluted a perpetual war is kindled amongst all living creatures necessity hunger want stimulate the strong and courageous fear anxiety terror agitate the weak and infirm the first entrance into life gives anguish to the newborn infant and to its wretched parent weakness impotence distress attend each stage of that life and it is at last finished in agony and horror  observe too says philo the curious artifices of nature in order to imbitter the life of every living being the stronger prey upon the weaker and keep them in perpetual terror and anxiety the weaker too in their turn often prey upon the stronger and vex and molest them without relaxation consider that innumerable race of insects which either are bred on the body of each animal or flying about infix their stings in him these insects have others still less than themselves which torment them and thus on each hand before and behind above and below every animal is surrounded with enemies which incessantly seek his misery and destruction  man alone said demea seems to be in part an exception to this rule for by combination in society he can easily master lions tigers and bears whose greater strength and agility naturally enable them to prey upon him  on the contrary it is here chiefly cried philo that the uniform and equal maxims of nature are most apparent man it is true can by combination surmount all his real enemies and become master of the whole animal creation but does he not immediately raise up to himself imaginary enemies the demons of his fancy who haunt him with superstitious terrors and blast every enjoyment of life his pleasure as he imagines becomes in their eyes a crime his food and repose give them umbrage and offense his very sleep and dreams furnish new materials to anxious fear and even death his refuge from every other ill presents only the dread of endless and innumerable woes nor does the wolf molest more the timid flock than superstition does the anxious breast of wretched mortals  besides consider demea this very society by which we surmount those wild beasts our natural enemies what new enemies does it not raise to us what woe and misery does it not occasion man is the greatest enemy of man oppression injustice contempt contumely violence sedition war calumny treachery fraud by these they mutually torment each other and they would soon dissolve that society which they had formed were it not for the dread of still greater ills which must attend their separation  but though these external insults said demea from animals from men from all the elements which assault us form a frightful catalogue of woes they are nothing in comparison of those which arise within ourselves from the distempered condition of our mind and body how many lie under the lingering torment of diseases hear the pathetic enumeration of the great poet  intestine stone and ulcer colicpangs daemoniac frenzy moping melancholy and moonstruck madness pining atrophy marasmus and widewasting pestilence dire was the tossing deep the groans despair tended the sick busiest from couch to couch and over them triumphant death his dart shook but delayed to strike though often invoked with vows as their chief good and final hope the disorders of the mind continued demea though more secret are not perhaps less dismal and vexatious remorse shame anguish rage disappointment anxiety fear dejection despair who has ever passed through life without cruel inroads from these tormentors how many have scarcely ever felt any better sensations labor and poverty so abhorred by every one are the certain lot of the far greater number and those few privileged persons who enjoy ease and opulence never reach contentment or true felicity all the goods of life united would not make a very happy man but all the ills united would make a wretch indeed and any one of them almost and who can be free from every one nay often the absence of one good and who can possess all is sufficient to render life ineligible  were a stranger to drop on a sudden into this world i would show him as a specimen of its ills an hospital full of diseases a prison crowded with malefactors and debtors a field of battle strowed with carcases a fleet foundering in the ocean a nation languishing under tyranny famine or pestilence to turn the gay side of life to him and give him a notion of its pleasures whither should i conduct him to a ball to an opera to court he might justly think that i was only showing him a diversity of distress and sorrow  there is no evading such striking instances said philo but by apologies which still farther aggravate the charge why have all men i ask in all ages complained incessantly of the miseries of life  they have no just reason says one these complaints proceed only from their discontented repining anxious disposition  and can there possibly i reply be a more certain foundation of misery than such a wretched temper  but if they were really as unhappy as they pretend says my antagonist why do they remain in life   not satisfied with life afraid of death this is the secret chain say i that holds us we are terrified not bribed to the continuance of our existence  it is only a false delicacy he may insist which a few refined spirits indulge and which has spread these complaints among the whole race of mankind  and what is this delicacy i ask which you blame is it any thing but a greater sensibility to all the pleasures and pains of life and if the man of a delicate refined temper by being so much more alive than the rest of the world is only so much more unhappy what judgment must we form in general of human life  let men remain at rest says our adversary and they will be easy they are willing artificers of their own misery  no reply i an anxious languor follows their repose disappointment vexation trouble their activity and ambition  i can observe something like what you mention in some others replied cleanthes but i confess i feel little or nothing of it in myself and hope that it is not so common as you represent it  if you feel not human misery yourself cried demea i congratulate you on so happy a singularity others seemingly the most prosperous have not been ashamed to vent their complaints in the most melancholy strains let us attend to the great the fortunate emperor charles v when tired with human grandeur he resigned all his extensive dominions into the hands of his son in the last harangue which he made on that memorable occasion he publicly avowed that the greatest prosperities which he had ever enjoyed had been mixed with so many adversities that he might truly say he had never enjoyed any satisfaction or contentment but did the retired life in which he sought for shelter afford him any greater happiness if we may credit his sons account his repentance commenced the very day of his resignation  ciceros fortune from small beginnings rose to the greatest luster and renown yet what pathetic complaints of the ills of life do his familiar letters as well as philosophical discourses contain and suitably to his own experience he introduces cato the great the fortunate cato protesting in his old age that had he a new life in his offer he would reject the present  ask yourself ask any of your acquaintance whether they would live over again the last ten or twenty years of their life no but the next twenty they say will be better and from the dregs of life hope to receive what the first sprightly running could not give   thus at last they find such is the greatness of human misery it reconciles even contradictions that they complain at once of the shortness of life and of its vanity and sorrow  and is it possible cleanthes said philo that after all these reflections and infinitely more which might be suggested you can still persevere in your anthropomorphism and assert the moral attributes of the deity his justice benevolence mercy and rectitude to be of the same nature with these virtues in human creatures his power we allow infinite whatever he wills is executed but neither man nor any other animal are happy therefore he does not will their happiness his wisdom is infinite he is never mistaken in choosing the means to any end but the course of nature tends not to human or animal felicity therefore it is not established for that purpose through the whole compass of human knowledge there are no inferences more certain and infallible than these in what respect then do his benevolence and mercy resemble the benevolence and mercy of men  epicuruss old questions are yet unanswered  is he willing to prevent evil but not able then is he impotent is he able but not willing then is he malevolent is he both able and willing whence then is evil  you ascribe cleanthes and i believe justly a purpose and intention to nature but what i beseech you is the object of that curious artifice and machinery which she has displayed in all animals the preservation alone of individuals and propagation of the species it seems enough for her purpose if such a rank be barely upheld in the universe without any care or concern for the happiness of the members that compose it no resource for this purpose no machinery in order merely to give pleasure or ease no fund of pure joy and contentment no indulgence without some want or necessity accompanying it at least the sew phenomena of this nature are overbalanced by opposite phenomena of still greater importance  our sense of music harmony and indeed beauty of all kinds gives satisfaction without being absolutely necessary to the preservation and propagation of the species but what racking pains on the other hand arise from gouts gravels megrims toothachs rheumatisms where the injury to the animalmachinery is either small or incurable mirth laughter play frolic seem gratuitous satisfactions which have no farther tendency spleen melancholy discontent superstition are pains of the same nature how then does the divine benevolence display itself in the sense of you anthropomorphites none but we mystics as you were pleased to call us can account for this strange mixture of phenomena by deriving it from attributes infinitely perfect but incomprehensible  and have you at last said cleanthes smiling betrayed your intentions philo your long agreement with demea did indeed a little surprise me but i find you were all the while crecting a concealed battery against me and i must confess that you have now fallen upon a subject worthy of your noble spirit of opposition and controversy if you can make out the present point and prove mankind to be unhappy or corrupted there is an end at once of all religion for to what purpose establish the natural attributes of the deity while the moral are still doubtful and uncertain  you take umbrage very easily replied demea at opinions the most innocent and the most generally received even amongst the religious and devout themselves and nothing can be more surprising than to find a topic like this concerning the wickedness and misery of man charged with no less than atheism and profaneness have not all pious divines and preachers who have indulged their rhetoric on so fertile a subject have they not easily i say given a solution of any difficulties which may attend it this world is but a point in comparison of the universe this life but a moment in comparison of eternity the present evil phenomena therefore are rectified in other regions and in some future period of existence and the eyes of men being then opened to larger views of things see the whole connection of general laws and trace with adoration the benevolence and rectitude of the deity through all the mazes and intricacies of his providence  no replied cleanthes no these arbitrary suppositions can never be admitted contrary to matter of fact visible and uncontroverted whence can any cause be known but from its known effects whence can any hypothesis be proved but from the apparent phenomena to establish one hypothesis upon another is building entirely in the air and the utmost we ever attain by these conjectures and fictions is to ascertain the bare possibility of our opinion but never can we upon such terms establish its reality  the only method of supporting divine benevolence and it is what i willingly embrace is to deny absolutely the misery and wickedness of man your representations are exaggerated your melancholy views mostly fictitious your inferences contrary to fact and experience health is more common than sickness pleasure than pain happiness than misery and for one vexation which we meet with we attain upon computation a hundred enjoyments  admitting your position replied philo which yet is extremely doubtful you must at the same time allow that if pain be less frequent than pleasure it is infinitely more violent and durable one hour of it is often able to outweigh a day a week a month of our common insipid enjoyments and how many days weeks and months are passed by several in the most acute torments pleasure scarcely in one instance is ever able to reach ecstasy and rapture and in no one instance can it continue for any time at its highest pitch and altitude the spirits evaporate the nerves relax the fabric is disordered and the enjoyment quickly degenerates into fatigue and uneasiness but pain often good god how often rises to torture and agony and the longer it continues it becomes still more genuine agony and torture patience is exhausted courage languishes melancholy seizes us and nothing terminates our misery but the removal of its cause or another event which is the sole cure of all evil but which from our natural folly we regard with still greater horror and consternation  but not to insist upon these topics continued philo though most obvious certain and important i must use the freedom to admonish you cleanthes that you have put the controversy upon a most dangerous issue and are unawares introducing a total skepticism into the most essential articles of natural and revealed theology what no method of fixing a just foundation for religion unless we allow the happiness of human life and maintain a continued existence even in this world with all our present pains infirmities vexations and follies to be eligible and desirable but this is contrary to every ones feeling and experience it is contrary to an authority so established as nothing can subvert no decisive proofs can ever be produced against this authority nor is it possible for you to compute estimate and compare all the pains and all the pleasures in the lives of all men and of all animals and thus by your resting the whole system of religion on a point which from its very nature must for ever be uncertain you tacitly confess that that system is equally uncertain  but allowing you what never will be believed at least what you never possibly can prove that animal or at least human happiness in this life exceeds its misery you have yet done nothing for this is not by any means what we expect from infinite power infinite wisdom and infinite goodness why is there any misery at all in the world not by chance surely from some cause then is it from the intention of the deity but he is perfectly benevolent is it contrary to his intention but he is almighty nothing can shake the solidity of this reasoning so short so clear so decisive except we assert that these subjects exceed all human capacity and that our common measures of truth and falsehood are not applicable to them a topic which i have all along insisted on but which you have from the beginning rejected with scorn and indignation  but i will be contented to retire still from this intrenchment for i deny that you can ever force me in it i will allow that pain or misery in man is compatible with infinite power and goodness in the deity even in your sense of these attributes what are you advanced by all these concessions a mere possible compatibility is not sufficient you must prove these pure unmixt and uncontrollable attributes from the present mixed and confused phenomena and from these alone a hopeful undertaking were the phenomena ever so pure and unmixt yet being finite they would be insufficient for that purpose how much more where they are also so jarring and discordant  here cleanthes i find myself at ease in my argument here i triumph formerly when we argued concerning the natural attributes of intelligence and design i needed all my skeptical and metaphysical subtilty to elude your grasp in many views of the universe and of its parts particularly the latter the beauty and fitness of final causes strike us with such irresistible force that all objections appear what i believe they really are mere cavils and sophisms nor can we then imagine how it was ever possible for us to repose any weight on them but there is no view of human life or of the condition of mankind from which without the greatest violence we can infer the moral attributes or learn that infinite benevolence conjoined with infinite power and infinite wisdom which we must discover by the eyes of faith alone it is your turn now to tug the laboring oar and to support your philosophical subtilties against the dictates of plain reason and experience  part xi i scruple not to allow said cleanthes that i have been apt to suspect the frequent repetition of the word infinite which we meet with in all theological writers to favor more of panegyric than of philosophy and that any purposes of reasoning and even of religion would be better served were we to rest contented with more accurate and more moderate expressions the terms admirable excellent superlatively great wise and holy these sufficiently fill the imaginations of men and any thing beyond besides that it leads into absurdities has no influence on the affections or sentiments thus in the present subject if we abandon all human analogy as seems your intention demea i am afraid we abandon all religion  retain no conception of the great object of our adoration part xi if we preserve human analogy we must for ever find it impossible to reconcile any mixture of evil in the universe with infinite attributes much less can we ever prove the latter from the former but supposing the author of nature to be finitely perfect though far exceeding mankind a satisfactory account may then be given of natural and moral evil and every untoward phenomenon be explained and adjusted a less evil may then be chosen in order to avoid a greater inconveniences be submitted to in order to reach a desirable end and in a word benevolence regulated by wisdom and limited by necessity may produce just such a world as the present you philo who are so prompt at starting views and reflections and analogies i would gladly hear at length without interruption your opinion of this new theory and if it deserve our attention we may afterward at more leisure reduce it into form  my sentiments replied philo are not worth being made a mystery of and therefore without any ceremony i shall deliver what occurs to me with regard to the present subject it must i think be allowed that if a very limited intelligence whom we shall suppose utterly unacquainted with the universe were assured that it were the production of a very good wise and powerful being however finite he would from his conjectures form beforehand a different notion of it from what we find it to be by experience nor would he ever imagine merely from these attributes of the cause of which he is informed that the effect could be so full of vice and misery and disorder as it appears in this life supposing now that this person were brought into the world still assured that it was the workmanship of such a sublime and benevolent being he might perhaps be surprised at the disappointment but would never retract his former belief if founded on any very solid argument since such a limited intelligence must be sensible of his own blindness and ignorance and must allow that there may be many solutions of those phenomena which will for ever escape his comprehension but supposing which is the real case with regard to man that this creature is not antecedently convinced of a supreme intelligence benevolent and powerful but is left to gather such a belief from the appearances of things this entirely alters the case nor will he ever find any reason for such a conclusion he may be fully convinced of the narrow limits of his understanding but this will not help him in forming an inference concerning the goodness of superior powers since he must form that inference from what he knows not from what he is ignorant of the more you exaggerate his weakness and ignorance the more diffident you render him and give him the greater suspicion that such subjects are beyond the reach of his faculties you are obliged therefore to reason with him merely from the known phenomena and to drop every arbitrary supposition or conjecture  did i show you a house or palace where there was not one apartment convenient or agreeable where the windows doors fires passages stairs and the whole economy of the building were the source of noise confusion fatigue darkness and the extremes of heat and cold you would certainly blame the contrivance without any farther examination the architect would in vain display his subtilty and prove to you that if this door or that window were altered greater ills would ensue what he says may be strictly true the alternation of one particular while the other parts of the building remain may only augment the inconveniences but still you would assert in general that if architect had had skill and good intentions he might have formed such a plan of the whole and might have adjusted the parts in such a manner as would have remedied all or most of these inconveniences his ignorance or even your own ignorance of such a plan will never convince you of the impossibility of it if you find many inconveniences and deformities in the building you will always without entering into any detail condemn the architect  in short i repeat the question is the world considered in general and as it appears to us in this life different from what a man or such a limited being would beforehand expect from a very powerful wise and benevolent deity it must be strange prejudice to assert the contrary and form thence i conclude that however consistent the world may be allowing certain suppositions and conjectures with the idea of such a deity it can never afford us an inference concerning his existence the consistence is not absolutely denied only the inference conjectures especially where infinity is excluded from the divine attributes may perhaps be sufficient to prove a consistence but can never be foundations for any inference  there seem to be four circumstances on which depend all or the greatest part of the ills that molest sensible creatures and it is not impossible but all these circumstances may be necessary and unavoidable we know so little beyond common life or even of common life that with regard to the economy of a universe there is no conjecture however wild which may not be just nor any one however plausible which may not be erroneous all that belongs to human understanding in this deep ignorance and obscurity is to be skeptical or at least cautious and not to admit of any hypothesis whatever much less of any which is supported by no appearance of probability now this i assert to be the case with regard to all the causes of evil and the circumstances on which it depends none of them appear to human reason in the least degree necessary or unavoidable nor can we suppose them such without the utmost license of imagination  the first circumstance which introduces evil is that contrivance or economy of the animal creation by which pains as well as pleasures are employed to excite all creatures to action and make them vigilant in the great work of selfpreservation now pleasure alone in its various degrees seems to human understanding sufficient for this prupose all animals might be constantly in a state of enjoyment but when urged by any of the necessities of nature such as thirst hunger weariness instead of pain they might feel a diminution of pleasure by which they might be prompted to seek that object which is necessary to their subsistence men pursue pleasure as eagerly as they avoid pain at least might have been so constituted it seems therefore plainly possible to carry on the business of life without any pain why then is any animal ever rendered susceptible of such a sensation if animals can be free from it an hour they might enjoy a perpetual exemption from it and it required as particular a contrivance of their organs to produce that feeling as to endow them with sight hearing or any of the senses shall we conjecture that such a contrivance was necessary without any appearance of reason and shall we build on that conjecture as on the most certain truth  but a capacity of pain would not alone produce pain were it not for the second circumstance viz the conducting of the world by general laws and this seems no wise necessary to a very perfect being it is true if every thing were conducted by particular volitions the course of nature would be perpetually broken and no man could employ his reason in the conduct of life but might not other particular volitions remedy this inconvenience in short might not the deity exterminate all ill wherever it were to be found and produce all good without any preparation or long progress of causes and effects  besides we must consider that according to the present economy of the world the course of nature though supposed exactly regular yet to us appears not so and many events are uncertain and many disappoint our expectations health and sickness calm and tempest with an infinite number of other accidents whose causes are unknown and variable have a great influence both on the fortunes of particular persons and on the prosperity of public societies and indeed all human life in a manner depends on such accidents a being therefore who knows the secret springs of the universe might easily by particular volitions turn all these accidents to the good of mankind and render the whole world happy without discovering himself in any operation a fleet whose purposes were salutary to society might always meet with a fair wind good princes enjoy sound health and long life persons born to power and authority be framed with good tempers and virtuous dispositions a few such events as these regularly and wisely conducted would change the face of the world and yet would no more seem to disturb the course of nature or confound human conduct than the present economy of things where the causes are secret and variable and compounded some small touches given to caligulas brain in his infancy might have converted him into a trajan one wave a little higher than the rest by burying caesar and his fortune in the bottom of the ocean might have restored liberty to a considerable part of mankind there may for aught we know be good reasons why providence interposes not in this manner but they are unknown to us and though the mere supposition that such reasons exist may be sufficient to save the conclusion concerning the divine attributes yet surely it can never be sufficient to establish that conclusion  if every thing in the universe be conducted by general laws and if animals be rendered susceptible of pain it scarcely seems possible but some ill must arise in the various shocks of matter and the various concurrence and opposition of general laws but this ill would be very rare were it not for the third circumstance which i proposed to mention viz the great frugality with which all powers and faculties are distributed to every particular being so well adjusted are the organs and capacities of all animals and so well fitted to their preservation that as far as history or tradition reaches there appears not to be any single species which has yet been extinguished in the universe every animal has the requisite endowments but these endowments are bestowed with so scrupulous an economy that any considerable diminution must entirely destroy the creature wherever one power is increased there is a proportional abatement in the others animals which excel in swiftness are commonly defective in force those which possess both are either imperfect in some of their senses or are oppressed with the most craving wants the human species whose chief excellency is reason and fagacity is of all others the most necessitous and the most deficient in bodily advantages without clothes without arms without food without lodging without any convenience of life except what they owe to their own skill and industry in short nature seems to have formed an exact calculation of the necessities of her creatures and like a rigid master has afforded them little more powers or endowments than what are strictly sufficient to supply those necessities an indulgent parent would have bestowed a large stock in order to guard against accidents and secure the happiness and welfare of the creature in the most unfortunate concurrence of circumstances every course of life would not have been so surrounded with precipices that the least departure from the true path by mistake or necessity must involve us in misery and ruin some reserve some fund would have been provided to ensure happiness nor would the powers and the necessities have been adjusted with so rigid an economy the author of nature is inconceivably powerful his force is supposed great if not altogether inexhaustible nor is there any reason as far as we can judge to make him observe this strict frugality in his dealings with his creatures it would have been better were his power extremely limited to have created fewer animals and to have endowed these with more faculties for their happiness and preservation a builder is never esteemed prudent who undertakes a plan beyond what his stock will enable him to finish  in order to cure most of the ills of human life i require not that man should have the wings of the eagle the swiftness of the stag the force of the ox the arms of the lion the scales of the crocodile or rhinoceros much lefs do i demand the sagacity of an angel or cherubim i am contented to take an increase in one single power or faculty of his soul let him be endowed with a greater propensity to industry and labor a more vigorous spring and activity of mind a more constant bent to business and application let the whole species possess naturally an equal diligence with that which many individuals are able to attain by habit and reflection and the most beneficial consequences without any allay of ill is the immediate and necessary result of this endowment almost all the moral as well as natural evils of human life arise from idleness and were our species by the original constitution of their frame exempt from this vice or infirmity the perfect cultivation of land the improvement of arts and manufactures the exact execution of every office and duty immediately follow and men at once may fully reach that state of society which is so imperfectly attained by the bestregulated government but as industry is a power and the most valuable of any nature seems determined suitably to her usual maxims to bestow it on men with a very sparing hand and rather to punish him severely for his deficiency in it than to reward him for his seize she has so contrived his frame that nothing but the most violent necessity can oblige him to labor and she employs all his other wants to overcome at least in part the want of diligence and to endow him with some share of a faculty of which she has thought fit naturally to bereave him here our demands may be allowed very humble and therefore the more reasonable if we required the endowments of superior penetration and judgment of a more delicate taste of beauty of a nicer sensibility to benevolence and friendship we might be told that we impiously pretend to break the order of nature that we want to exalt ourselves into a higher rank of being that the presents which we require not being suitable to our state and condition would only be pernicious to us but it is hard i dare to repeat it it is hard that being placed in a world so full of wants and necessities where almost every being and element is either our foe or refuses its assistance  we should also have our own temper to struggle with and should be deprived of that faculty which can alone fence against these multiplied evils  the fourth circumstance whence arises the misery and ill of the universe is the inaccurate workmanship of all the springs and principles of the great machine of nature it must be acknowledged that there are few parts of the universe which seem not to serve some purpose and whose removal would not produce a visible defect and disorder in the whole the parts hang all together nor can one be touched without affecting the rest in a greater or less degree but at the same time it must be observed that none of these parts or principles however useful are so accurately adjusted as to keep precisely within those bounds in which their utility consists but they are all of them apt on every occasion to run into the one extreme or the other one would imagine that this grand production had not received the last hand of the maker so little finished is every part and so coarse are the strokes with which it is executed thus the winds are requisite to convey the vapors along the surface of the globe and to assist men in navigation but how often rising up to tempests and hurricanes do they become pernicious rains are necessary to nourish all the plants and animals of the earth but how often are they defective how often excessive heat is requisite to all life and vegetation but is not always found in the due proportion on the mixture and secretion of the humors and juices of the body depend the health and prosperity of the animal but the parts perform not regularly their proper function what more useful than all the passions of the mind ambition vanity love anger but how often do they break their bounds and cause the greatest convulsions in society there is nothing so advantageous in the universe but what frequently becomes pernicious by its excess or defect nor has nature guarded with the requisite accuracy against all disorder or confusion the irregularity is never perhaps so great as to destroy any species but is often sufficient to involve the individuals in ruin and misery  on the concurrence then of these four circumstances does all or the greatest part of natural evil depend were all living creatures incapable of pain or were the world administered by particular volitions evil never could have found access into the universe and were animals endowed with a large stock of powers and faculties beyond what strict necessity requires or were the several springs and principles of the universe so accurately framed as to preserve always the just temperament and medium there must have been very little ill in comparison of what we feel at present what then shall we pronounce on this occasion shall we say that these circumstances are not necessary and that they might easily have been altered in the contrivance of the universe this decision seems too presumptuous for creatures so blind and ignorant let us be more modest in our conclusions let us allow that if the goodness of the deity i mean a goodness like the human could be established on any tolerable reasons a priori these phenomena however untoward would not be sufficient to subvert that principle but might easily in some unknown manner be reconcilable to it but let us still assert that as this goodness is not antecedently established but must be inferred from the phenomena there can be no grounds for such an inference while there are so many ills in the universe and while these ills might so easily have been remedied as far as human understanding can be allowed to judge on such a subject i am skeptic enough to allow that the bad appearances notwithstanding all my reasonings may be compatible with such attributes as you suppose but surely they can never prove these attributes such a conclusion cannot result from skepticism but must arise from the phenomena and from our confidence in the reasonings which we deduce from these phenomena  look round this universe what an immense profusion of beings animated and organized fensible and active you admire this prodigious variety and fecundity but inspect a little more narrowly these living existences the only beings worth regarding how hostile and destructive to each other how insufficient all of them for their own happiness how contemptible or odious to the spectator the whole presents nothing but the idea of a blind nature impregnated by a great vivifying principle and pouring forth from her lap without discernment or parental care her maimed and abortive children  here the manichaean system occurs as a proper hypothesis to solve the difficulty and no doubt in some respects it is very specious and has more probability than the common hypothesis by giving a plausible account of the strange mixture of good and ill which appears in life but if we consider on the other hand the perfect uniformity and agreement of the parts of the universe we shall not discover in it any marks of the combat of a malevolent with a benevolent being there is indeed an opposition of pains and pleasures in the feelings of sensible creatures but are not all the operations of nature carried on by an opposition of principles of hot and cold moist and dry light and heavy the true conclusion is that the original source of all things is entirely indifferent to all these principles and has no more regard to good above ill than to heat above cold or to drought above moisture or to light above heavy  there may four hypotheses be framed concerning the first causes of the universe that they are endowed with perfect goodness that they have perfect malice that they are opposite and have both goodness and malice that they have neither goodness nor malice mixed phenomena can never prove the two former unmixt principles and the uniformity and steadiness of general laws seems to oppose the third the fourth therefore seems by far the most probable  what i have said concerning natural evil will apply to moral with little or no variation and we have no more reason to infer that the rectitude of the supreme being resembles human rectitude than that his benevolence resembles the human nay it will be thought that we have still greater cause to exclude from him moral sentiments such as we feel them since moral evil in the opinion of many is much more predominant above moral good than natural evil above natural good  but even though this should not be allowed and though the virtue which is in mankind should be acknowledged much superior to the vice yet so long as there is any vice at all in the universe it will very much puzzle you anthropomorphites how to account for it you must assign a cause for it without having recourse to the first cause but as every effect must have a cause and that cause another you must either carry on the progression in infinitum or rest on that original principle who is the ultimate cause of all things   hold hold cried demea whither does your imagination hurry you i joined in alliance with you in order to prove the incomprehensible nature of the divine being and refute the principles of cleanthes who would measure every thing by a human rule and standard but i now find you running into all the topics of the greatest libertines and infidels and betraying that holy cause which you seemingly espoused are you secretly then a more dangerous enemy than cleanthes himself  and are you so late in perceiving it replied cleanthes believe me demea your friend philo from the beginning has been amusing himself at both our expense and it must be confessed that the injudicious reasoning of our vulgar theology has given him but too just a handle of ridicule the total infirmity of human reason the absolute incomprehensibility of the divine nature the great and universal misery and still greater wickedness of men these are strange topics surely to be so fondly cherished by orthodox divines and doctors in ages of stupidity and ignorance indeed these principles may safely be espoused and perhaps no views of things are more proper to promote superstition than such as encourage the blind amazement the diffidence and melancholy of mankind but at present   blame not so much interposed philo the ignorance of these reverend gentlemen they know how to change their style with the times formerly it was a most popular theological topic to maintain that human life was vanity and misery and to exaggerate all the ills and pains which are incident to men but of late years divines we find begin to retract this position and maintain though still with some hesitation that there are more goods than evils more pleasures than pains even in this life when religion stood entirely upon temper and education it was thought proper to encourage melancholy as indeed mankind never have recourse to superior powers so readily as in that disposition but as men have now learned to form principles and to draw consequences it is necessary to change the batteries and to make use of such arguments as will endure at least some scrutiny and examination this variation is the same and from the same causes with that which i formerly remarked with regard to skepticism  thus philo continued to the last his spirit of opposition and his censure of established opinions but i could observe that demea did not at all relish the latter part of the discourse and he took occasion soon after on some pretense or other to leave the company  part xii after demeas departure part xii cleanthes and philo continued the conversation in the following manner our friend i am afraid said cleanthes will have little inclination to revive this topic of discourse while you are in company and to tell truth philo i should rather wish to reason with either of you apart on a subject so sublime and interesting your spirit of controversy joined to your abhorrence of vulgar superstition carries you strange lengths when engaged in an argument and there is nothing so sacred and venerable even in your own eyes which you spare on that occasion  i must confess replied philo that i am less cautious on the subject of natural religion than on any other both because i know that i can never on that head corrupt the principles of any man of common sense and because no one i am confident in whose eyes i appear a man of common sense will ever mistake my intentions you in particular cleanthes with whom i live in unreserved intimacy you are sensible that notwithstanding the freedom of my conversation and my love of singular arguments no one has a deeper sense of religion impressed on his mind or pays more profound adoration to the divine being as he discovers himself to reason in the inexplicable contrivance and artifice of nature a purpose an intention a design strikes every where the most careless the most stupid thinker and no man can be so hardened in absurd systems as at all times to reject it that nature does nothing in vain is a maxim established in all the schools merely from the contemplation of the works of nature without any religious purpose and from a firm conviction of its truth an anatomist who had observed a new organ or canal would never be satisfied till he had also discovered its use and intention one great foundation of the copernican system is the maxim that nature acts by the simplest methods and chooses the most proper means to any end and astronomers often without thinking of it lay this strong foundation of piety and religion the same thing is observable in other parts of philosophy and thus all the sciences almost lead us insensibly to acknowledge a first intelligent author and their authority is often so much the greater as they do not directly profess that intention  it is with pleasure i hear galen reason concerning the structure of the human body the anatomy of a man says he de formatione foetus  discovers above  00 different muscles and whoever duly considers these will find that in each of them nature must have adjusted at least ten different circumstances in order to attain the end which she proposed proper figure just magnitude right disposition of the several ends upper and lower position of the whole the due insertion of the several nerves veins and arteries so that in the muscles alone above  000 several views and intentions must have been formed and executed the bones he calculates to be     the distinct purposes aimed at in the structure of each above forty what a prodigious display of artifice even in these simple and homogeneous parts but if we consider the skin ligaments vessels glandules humors the several limbs and members of the body how must our astonishment rise upon us in proportion to the number and intricacy of the parts so artificially adjusted the farther we advance in these researches we discover new scenes of art and wisdom but descry still at a distance farther scenes beyond our reach in the fine internal structure of the parts in the economy of the brain in the fabric of the seminal vessels all these artifices are repeated in every different species of animal with wonderful variety and with exact propriety suited to the different intentions of nature in framing each species and if the infidelity of galen even when these natural sciences were still imperfect could not withstand such striking appearances to what pitch of pertinacious obstinacy must a philosopher in this age have attained who can now doubt of a supreme intelligence  could i meet with one of this species who i thank god are very rare i would ask him supposing there were a god who did not discover himself immediately to our senses were it possible for him to give stronger proofs of his existence than what appear on the whole face of nature what indeed could such a divine being do but copy the present economy of things render many of his artifices so plain that no stupidity could mistake them afford glimpses of still greater artifices which demonstrate his prodigious superiority above our narrow apprehensions and conceal altogether a great many from such imperfect creatures now according to all rules of just reasoning every fact must pass for undisputed when it is supported by all the arguments which its nature admits of even though these arguments be not in themselves very numerous or forcible how much more in the present case where no human imagination can compute their number and no understanding estimate their cogency  i shall farther add said cleanthes to what you have so well urged that one great advantage of the principle of theism is that it is the only system of cosmogony which can be rendered intelligible and complete and yet can throughout preserve a strong analogy to what we every day see and experience in the world the comparison of the universe to a machine of human contrivance is so obvious and natural and is justified by so many instances of order and design in nature that it must immediately strike all unprejudiced apprehensions and procure universal approbation whoever attempts to weaken this theory cannot pretend to succeed by establishing in its place any other that is precise and determinate it is sufficient for him if he start doubts and difficulties and by remote and abstract views of things reach that suspense of judgment which is here the utmost boundary of his wishes but besides that this state of mind is in itself unsatisfactory it can never be steadily maintained against such striking appearances as continually engage us into the religious hypothesis a false absurd system human nature from the force of prejudice is capable of adhering to with obstinacy and perseverance but no system at all in opposition to a theory supported by strong and obvious reason by natural propensity and by early education i think it absolutely impossible to maintain or defend  so little replied philo do i esteem this suspense of judgment in the present case to be possible that i am apt to suspect there enters somewhat of a dispute of words into this controversy more than is usually imagined that the works of nature bear a great analogy to the productions of art is evident and according to all the rules of good reasoning we ought to infer if we argue at all concerning them that their causes have a proportional analogy but as there are also considerable differences we have reason to suppose a proportional difference in the causes and in particular ought to attribute a much higher degree of power and energy to the supreme cause than any we have ever observed in mankind here then the existence of a deity is plainly ascertained by reason and if we make it a question whether on account of these analogies we can properly call him a mind or intelligence notwithstanding the vast difference which may reasonably be supposed between him and human minds what is this but a mere verbal controversy no man can deny the analogies between the effects to restrain ourselves from enquiring concerning the causes is scarcely possible from this enquiry the legitimate conclusion is that the causes have also an analogy and if we are not contented with calling the first and supreme cause a god or deity but desire to vary the expression what can we call him but mind or thought to which he is justly supposed to bear a considerable resemblance  all men of sound reason are disgusted with verbal disputes which abound so much in philosophical and theological enquiries and it is found that the only remedy for this abuse must arise from clear definitions from the precision of those ideas which enter into any argument and from the strict and uniform use of those terms which are employed but there is a species of controversy which from the very nature of language and of human ideas is involved in perpetual ambiguity and can never by any precaution or any definitions be able to reach a reasonable certainty or precision these are the controversies concerning the degrees of any quality or circumstance men may argue to all eternity whether hannibal be a great or a very great or a superlatively great man what degree of beauty cleopatra possessed what epithet of praise livy or thucidydes is entitled to without bringing the controversy to any determination the disputants may here agree in their sense and differ in the terms or vice versa yet never be able to define their terms so as to enter into each others meaning because the degrees of these qualities are not like quantity or number susceptible of any exact mensuration which may be the standard in the controversy that the dispute concerning theism is of this nature and consequently is merely verbal or perhaps if possible still more incurably ambiguous will appear upon the slightest enquiry i ask the theist if he does not allow that there is a great and immeasurable because incomprehensible difference between the human and the divine mind the more pious he is the more readily will he assent to the affirmative and the more will he be disposed to magnify the difference he will even assert that the difference is of a nature which cannot be too much magnified i next turn to the atheist who i assert is only nominally so and can never possibly be in earnest and i ask him whether from the coherence and apparent sympathy in all the parts of this world there be not a certain degree of analogy among all the operations of nature in every situation and in every age whether the rotting of a turnip the generation of an animal and the structure of human thought be not energies that probably bear some remote analogy to each other it is impossible he can deny it he will readily acknowledge it having obtained this concession i push him still farther in his retreat and i ask him if it be not probable that the principle which first arranged and still maintains order in this universe bears not also some remote inconceivable analogy to the other operations of nature and among the rest to the economy of human mind and thought however reluctant he must give his assent where then cry i to both these antagonists is the subject of your dispute the theist allows that the original intelligence is very different from human reason the atheist allows that the original principle of order bears some remote analogy to it will you quarrel gentlemen about the degrees and enter into a controversy which admits not of any precise meaning nor consequently of any determination if you should be so obstinate i should not to be surprised to find you insensibly change sides while the theist on the one hand exaggerates the dissimilarity between the supreme being and frail imperfect variable fleeting and mortal creatures and the atheist on the other magnifies the analogy among all the operations of nature in every period every situation and every position consider then where the real point of controversy lies and if you cannot lay aside your disputes endeavor at least to cure yourselves of your animosity  and here i must also acknowledge cleanthes that as the works of nature have a much greater analogy to the effects of our art and contrivance than to those of our benevolence and justice we have reason to infer that the natural attributes of the deity have a greater resemblance to those of man than his moral have to human virtues but what is the consequence nothing but this that the moral qualities of man are more defective in their kind than his natural abilities for as the supreme being is allowed to be absolutely and entirely perfect whatever differs most from him departs the farthest from the supreme standard of rectitude and perfection it seems evident that the dispute between the skeptics and dogmatists is entirely verbal or at least regards only the degrees of doubt and assurance which we ought to indulge with regard to all reasoning and such disputes are commonly at the bottom verbal and admit not of any precise determination no philosophical dogmatist denies that there are difficulties both with regard to the senses and to all science and that these difficulties are in a regular logical method absolutely insolveable no skeptic denies that we lie under an absolute necessity notwithstanding these difficulties of thinking and believing and reasoning with regard to all kind of subjects and even of frequently assenting with confidence and security the only difference then between these sects if they merit that name is that the skeptic from habit caprice or inclination insists most on the difficulties the dogmatist for like reasons on the necessity   these cleanthes are my unfeigned sentiments on this subject and these sentiments you know i have ever cherished and maintained but in proportion to my veneration for true religion is my abhorrence of vulgar superstitions and i indulge a peculiar pleasure i confess in pushing such principles sometimes into absurdity sometimes into impiety and you are sensible that all bigots notwithstanding their great aversion to the latter above the former are commonly equally guilty of both  my inclination replied cleanthes lies i own a contrary way religion however corrupted is still better than no religion at all the doctrine of a future state is so strong and necessary a security to morals that we never ought to abandon or neglect it for if finite and temporary rewards and punishments have so great an effect as we daily find how much greater must be expected from such as are infinite and eternal  how happens it then said philo if vulgar superstition be so salutary to society that all history abounds so much with accounts of its pernicious consequences on public assairs factions civil wars persecutions subversions of government oppression slavery these are the dismal consequences which always attend its prevalency over the minds of men if the religious spirit be ever mentioned in any historical narration we are sure to meet afterward with a detail of the miseries which attend it and no period of time can be happier or more prosperous than those in which it is never regarded or heard of  the reason of this observation replied cleanthes is obvious the proper office of religion is to regulate the heart of men humanize their conduct infuse the spirit of temperance order and obedience and as its operation is silent and only enforces the motives of morality and justice it is in danger of being overlooked and confounded with these other motives when it distinguishes itself and acts as a separate principle over men it has departed from its proper sphere and has become only a cover to faction and ambition  and so will all religion said philo except the philosophical and rational kind your reasonings are more easily eluded than my facts the inference is not just because finite and temporary rewards and punishments have so great influence that therefore such as are infinite and eternal must have so much greater consider i beseech you the attachment which we have to present things and the little concern which we discover for objects so remote and uncertain when divines are declaiming against the common behavior and conduct of the world they always represent this principle as the strongest imaginable which indeed it is and describe almost all human kind as lying under the influence of it and sunk into the deepest lethargy and unconcern about their religious interests yet these same divines when they refute their speculative antagonists suppose the motives of religion to be so powerful that without them it were impossible for civil society to subsist nor are they ashamed of so palpable a contradiction it is certain from experience that the smallest grain of natural honesty and benevolence has more effect on mens conduct than the most pompous views suggested by theological theories and systems a mans natural inclination works incessantly upon him it is for ever present to the mind and mingles itself with every view and consideration whereas religious motives where they act at all operate only by starts and bounds and it is scarcely possible for them to become altogether habitual to the mind the force of the greatest gravity say the philosephers is infinitely small in comparison of that of the least impulse yet it is certain that the smallest gravity will in the end prevail above a great impulse because no strokes or blows can be repeated with such constancy as attraction and gravitation  another advantage of inclination it engages on its side all the wit and ingenuity of the mind and when set in opposition to religious principles seeks every method and art of eluding them in which it is almost always successful who can explain the heart of man or account for those strange salvos and excuses with which people satisfy themselves when they follow their inclinations in opposition to their religious duty this is well understood in the world and none but fools ever repose less trust in a man because they hear that from study and philosophy he has entertained some speculative doubts with regard to theological subjects and when we have to do with a man who makes a great profession of religion and devotion has this any other effect upon several who pass for prudent than to put them on their guard lest they be cheated and deceived by him  we must farther consider that philosophers who cultivate reason and reflection stand less in need of such motives to keep them under the restraint of morals and that the vulgar who alone may need them are utterly incapable of so pure a religion as represents the deity to be pleased with nothing but virtue in human behavior the recommendations to the divinity are generally supposed to be either frivolous observances or rapturous ecstasies or a bigoted credulity we need not run back into antiquity or wander into remote regions to find instances of this degeneracy amongst ourselves some have been guilty of that atrociousness unknown to the egyptian and grecian superstitions of declaiming in express terms against morality and representing it as a sure forfeiture of the divine favor if the least trust or reliance be laid upon it  but even though superstition or enthusiasm should not put itself in direct opposition to morality the very diverting of the attention the raising up a new and frivolous species of merit the preposterous distribution which it makes of praise and blame must have the most pernicious consequences and weaken extremely mens attachment to the natural motives of justice and humanity  such a principle of action likewise not being any of the familiar motives of human conduct acts only by intervals on the temper and must be rouzed by continual efforts in order to render the pious zealot satisfied with his own conduct and make him fulfill his devotional task many religious exercises are entered into with seeming fervor where the heart at the time feels cold and languid a habit of dissimulation is by degrees contracted and fraud and falsehood become the predominant principle hence the reason of that vulgar observation that the highest zeal in religion and the deepest hypocrisy so far from being inconsistent are often or commonly united in the same individual character  the bad effects of such habits even in common life are easily imagined but where the interests of religion are concerned no morality can be forcible enough to bind the enthusiastic zealot the sacredness of the cause sanctifies every measure which can be made use of to promote it  the steady attention alone to so important an interest as that of eternal salvation is apt to extinguish the benevolent affections and beget a narrow contracted selfishness and when such a temper is encouraged it easily eludes all the general precepts of charity and benevolence  thus the motives of vulgar superstition have no great influence on general conduct nor is their operation very favorable to morality in the instances where they predominate  is there any maxim in politics more certain and infallible than that both the number and authority of priests should be confined within very narrow limits and that the civil magistrate ought for ever to keep his fasces and axes from such dangerous hands but if the spirit of popular religion were so salutary to society a contrary maxim ought to prevail the greater number of priests and their greater authority and riches will always augment the religious spirit and though the priests have the guidance of this spirit why may we not expect a superior sanctity of life and greater benevolence and moderation from persons who are set apart for religion who are continually inculcating it upon others and who must themselves imbibe a greater share of it whence comes it then that in fact the utmost a wise magistrate can propose with regard to popular religions is as far as possible to make a saving game of it and to prevent their pernicious consequences with regard to society every expedient which he tries for so humble a purpose is surrounded with inconveniences if he admits only one religion among his subjects he must sacrifice to an uncertain prospect of tranquillity every consideration of public liberty science reason industry and even his own independency if he gives indulgence to several sects which is the wiser maxim he must preserve a very philosophical indifference to all of them and carefully restrain the pretensions of the prevailing sect otherwise he can expect nothing but endless disputes quarrels factions persecutions and civil commotions  true religion i allow has no such pernicious consequences but we must treat of religion as it has commonly been found in the world nor have i any thing to do with that speculative tenet of theism which as it is a species of philosophy must partake of the beneficial influence of that principle and at the same time must lie under a like inconvenience of being always confined to very few persons  oaths are requisite in all courts of judicature but it is a question whether their authority arises from any popular religion it is the solemnity and importance of the occasion the regard to reputation and the reflecting on the general interests of society which are the chief restraints upon mankind customhouse oaths and political oaths are but little regarded even by some who pretend to principles of honesty and religion and a quakers asseveration is with us justly put upon the same footing with the oath of any other person i know that polybius lib   cap    ascribes the infamy of greek faith to the prevalency of the epicurean philosophy but i know also that punic faith had as bad a reputation in ancient times as irish evidence has in modern though we cannot account for these vulgar observations by the same reason not to mention that greek faith was infamous before the rise of the epicurean philosophy and euripides iphigenia in tauride  in a passage which i shall point out to you has glanced a remarkable stroke of satire against his nation with regard to this circumstance  take care philo replied cleanthes take care push not matters too far allow not your zeal against false religion to undermine your veneration for the true forfeit not this principle the chief the only great comfort in life and our principal support amidst all the attacks of adverse fortune the most agreeable reflection which it is possible for human imagination to suggest is that of genuine theism which represents us as the workmanship of a being perfectly good wise and powerful who created us for happiness and who having implanted in us immeasureable desires of good will prolong our existence to all eternity and will transfer us into an infinite variety of scenes in order to satisfy those desires and render our felicity complete and durable next to such a being himself if the comparison be allowed the happiest lot which we can imagine is that of being under his guardianship and protection  these appearances said philo are most engaging and alluring and with regard to the true philosopher they are more than appearances but it happens here as in the former case that with regard to the greater part of mankind the appearances are deceitful and that the terrors of religion commonly prevail above its comforts  it is allowed that men never have recourse to devotion so readily as when dejected with grief or depressed with sickness is not this a proof that the religious spirit is not so nearly allied to joy as to sorrow  but men when afflicted find consolation in religion replied cleanthes sometimes said philo but it is natural to imagine that they will form a notion of those unknown beings suitably to the present gloom and melancholy of their temper when they betake themselves to the contemplation of them accordingly we find the tremendous images to predominate in all religions and we ourselves after having employed the most exalted expression in our descriptions of the deity fall into the flattest contradiction in affirming that the damned are infinitely superior in number to the elect  i shall venture to affirm that there never was a popular religion which represented the state of departed souls in such a light as would render it eligible for human kind that there should be such a state these fine models of religion are the mere product of philosophy for as death lies between the eye and the prospect of futurity that event is so shocking to nature that it must throw a gloom on all the regions which lie beyond it and suggest to the generality of mankind the idea of cerberus and furies devils and torrents of fire and brimstone  it is true both fear and hope enter into religion because both these passions at different times agitate the human mind and each of them forms a species of divinity suitable to itself but when a man is in a cheerful disposition he is fit for business or company or entertainment of any kind and he naturally applies himself to these and thinks not of religion when melancholy and dejected he has nothing to do but brood upon the terrors of the invisible world and to plunge himself still deeper in affliction it may indeed happen that after he has in this manner ingraved the religious opinions deep into his thought and imagination there may arrive a change of health or circumstances which may restore his good humor and raising cheerful prospects of futurity make him run into the other extreme of joy and triumph but still it must be acknowledged that as terror is the primary principle of religion it is the passion which always predominates in it and admits but of short intervals of pleasure  not to mention that these fits of excessive enthusiastic joy by exhausting the spirits always prepare the way for equal fits of superstitious terror and dejection nor is there any state of mind so happy as the calm and equable but this state it is impossible to support where a man thinks that he lies in such profound darkness and uncertainty between an eternity of happiness and an eternity of misery no wonder that such an opinion disjoints the ordinary frame of the mind and throws it into the utmost confusion and though that opinion is seldom so steady in its operation as to influence all the actions yet is it apt to make a considerable breach in the temper and to produce that gloom and melancholy so remarkable in all devout people  it is contrary to common sense to entertain apprehensions or terrors upon account of any opinion whatsoever or to imagine that we run any risk hereafter by the freest use of our reason such a sentiment implies both an absurdity and an inconsistency it is an absurdity to believe that the deity has human passions and one of the lowest of human passions a restless appetite for applause it is an inconsistency to believe that since the deity has this human passion he has not others also and in particular a disregard to the opinions of creatures so much inferior  to know god says seneca is to worship him all other worship is indeed absurd superstitious and even impious it degrades him to the low condition of mankind who are delighted with entreaty solicitation presents and slattery yet is this impiety the smallest of which superstition is guilty commonly it depresses the deity far below the condition of mankind and represents him as a capricious demon who exercises his power without reason and without humanity and were that divine being disposed to be offended at the vices and follies of silly mortals who are his own workmanship ill would it surely fare with the votaries of most popular superstitions nor would any of human race merit his favor but a very few the philosophical theists who entertain or rather indeed endeavor to entertain suitable notions of his divine perfections as the only persons entitled to his compassion and indulgence would be the philosophical skeptics a sect almost equally rare who from a natural diffidence of their own capacity suspend or endeavor to suspend all judgment with regard to such sublime and such extraordinary subjects  if the whole of natural theology as some people seem to maintain resolves itself into one simple though somewhat ambiguous at least undefined proposition that the cause or causes of order in the universe probably bear some remote analogy to human intelligence if this proposition be not capable of extension variation or more particular explication if it affords no inference that affects human life or can be the source of any action or forbearance and if the analogy imperfect as it is can be carried no farther than to the human intelligence and cannot be transferred with any appearance of probability to the other qualities of the mind if this really be the case what can the most inquisitive contemplative and religious man do more than give a plain philosophical assent to the proposition as often as it occurs and believe that the arguments on which it is established exceed the objections which lie against it some astonishment indeed will naturally arise from the greatness of the object some melancholy from its obscurity some contempt of human reason that it can give no solution more satisfactory with regard to so extraordinary and magnificent a question but believe me cleanthes the most natural sentiment which a welldisposed mind will feel on this occasion is a longing desire and expectation that heaven would be pleased to dissipate at least alleviate this profound ignorance by affording some more particular revelation to mankind and making discoveries of the nature attributes and operations of the divine object of our faith a person seasoned with a just sense of the imperfections of natural reason will fly to revealed truth with the greatest avidity while the haughty dogmatist persuaded that he can erect a complete system of theology by the mere help of philosophy disdains any farther aid and rejects this adventitious instructor to be a philosophical skeptic is in a man of letters the first and most essential step toward being a sound believing christian a proposition which i would willingly recommend to the attention of pamphilus and i hope cleanthes will forgive me for interposing so far in the education and instruction of his pupil  cleanthes and philo pursued not this conversation much farther and as nothing ever made greater impression on me than all the reasonings of that day so i confess that upon a serious review of the whole i cannot but think that philos principles are more probable than demeas but that those of cleanthes approach still nearer to the truth  finis
