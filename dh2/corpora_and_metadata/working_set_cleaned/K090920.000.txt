port lost no time in carrying the orders i had brought into execution so that on the morning of the ninth the detachment of marines were on board with all the baggage but the next day being ushered in with a very heavy gale of wind      march made it impracticable to remove the convicts from on board the dunkirk prisonship where they were confined so violent was the gale that his majestys ship the druid of thirtytwo guns was forced to cut away her mainmast to prevent her driving on shore  the weather being moderate the following day the convicts were put on board the transports and placed in the different apartments allotted for them all secured in irons except the women in the evening as there was but little wind we were towed by the boats belonging to the guardships out of the hamaoze where the dunkirk lay into plymouth sound when this duty was completed the boats returned and the wind now freshening so as to enable us to clear the land we proceeded to spithead where we arrived the seventeenth and anchored on the mother bank among the rest of the transports and victuallers intended for the same expedition under the conduct of his majestys ship the sirius as soon as the ship came to anchor i visited all the other transports and was really surprised to find the convicts on board them so very healthy when i got on board the alexander i found there a medical gentleman from portsmouth among whose acquaintance i had not the honor to be numbered he scarcely gave me time to get upon the quarter deck before he thus addressed me  i am very glad you are arrived sir for your people have got a malignant disease among them of a most dangerous kind and it will be necessary for their preservation to get them immediately relanded surprised at such a salutation and alarmed at the purport of it i requested of my assistant mr balmain an intelligent young man whom i had appointed to this ship for the voyage to let me see the people who were ill sir returned mr balmain taking me aside you will not find things by any means so bad as this gentleman represents them to be they are made much worse by him than they really are unlike a person wishing to administer comfort to those who are afflicted either in body or in mind he has publicly declared before the poor creatures who are ill that they must inevitably fall a sacrifice to the malignant disorder with which they are afflicted  the malignity of which appears to me to exist only in his own imagination i did not however continued mr balmain think proper to contradict the gentleman supposing from the consequence he assumed and the ease with which he had given his opinion or more properly his directions that he was some person appointed by the secretary of state to officiate for you till your arrival when you go among the people you will be better able to judge of the propriety of what i have said mr balmain had no sooner concluded than i went between decks and found every thing just as he had represented it to be there were several in bed with slight inflammatory complaints some there were who kept their bed to avoid the inconvenience of the cold which was at this time very piercing and whose wretched clothing was but a poor defense against the rigor of it others were confined to their bed through the effects of long imprisonment a weakened habit and lowness of spirits which was not a little added to by the declaration of the medical gentleman above mentioned whom they concluded to be the principal surgeon to the expedition however on my undeceiving them in that point and at the same time confirming what mr balmain had from the first told them viz that their complaints were neither malignant nor dangerous their fears abated to this i added that i would immediately give orders for such as were in want of clothing to be supplied with what was needful a power delegated to me by captain phillip together with the liberty of giving such other directions as i thought would tend to the recovery or preservation of their health and further as they had been nearly four months on board and during that time had been kept upon salt provisions i would endeavor to get fresh for them while in port this short conversation had so sudden an effect on those i addressed and was of so opposite a tendency to that of the gentleman alluded to that before we got from between decks i had the pleasure to see several of them put on such clothes as they had and look a little cheerful i then pointed out to lieutenant johnson commanding officer of the marines on board and to the master of the ship the necessity there was of admitting the convicts upon the deck one half at a time during the course of the day in order that they might breathe a purer air as nothing would conduce more to the preservation of their health to this these gentlemen readily assented adding that they had no objection to the whole number coming upon deck at once if i thought it necessary as they were not apprehensive of any danger from the indulgence on returning to the quarter deck i found my new medical acquaintance still there and before i could give some directions to mr balmain as i was about to do he thus once more addressed me  i suppose you are now convinced of the dangerous disease that prevails among these people and of the necessity of having them landed in order to get rid of it not a little hurt at the absurd part the gentleman had acted and at his repeated importunity i replied with some warmth that i was very sorry to differ so essentially in opinion from him as to be obliged to tell him that there was not the least appearance of malignity in the disease under which the convicts labored but that it wholly proceeded from the cold and was nearly similar to a complaint then prevalent even among the better sort of people in and about portsmouth notwithstanding this he still persisted so much in the propriety of their being landed and the necessity there was for an application to the secretary of state upon the occasion that i could no longer keep my temper and i freely told him that the idea of landing them was as improper as it was absurd and in order to make him perfectly easy on that head i assured him that when any disease rendered it necessary to call in medical aid he might rest satisfied i would not trouble him but would apply to doctor lind physician to the royal hospital at hasler a gentleman as eminently distinguished for his professional abilities as his other amiable qualities or else to some of the surgeons of his majestys ships in portsmouth harbor or at spithead most of whom i had the pleasure of knowing and on whose medical knowledge i was certain i could depend this peremptory declaration had the desired effect the gentleman took his leave to my great satisfaction and thereby gave me an opportunity of writing by that evenings post to inform the secretary of state and captain phillip of the real state of the sick and at the same time to urge the necessity of having fresh provisions served to the whole of the convicts while in port as well as a little wine for those who were ill fresh provisions i dwelt most on as being not only needful for the recovery of the sick but otherwise essential in order to prevent any of them commencing so long and tedious a voyage as they had before them with a scorbutic taint a consequence that would most likely attend their living upon salt food and which added to their needful confinement and great numbers would in all probability prove fatal to them and thereby defeat the intention of government  the return of the post brough me an answer and likewise an order to the contractor for supplying the marines and convicts daily with fresh beef and vegetables while in port a similar order i found had been given long before my arrival but by some strange mistake or other had not been complied with the salutary effect of this change of diet with the addition of some wine and other necessaries ordered for the sick through the humanity of lord sydney manifested itself so suddenly that in the space of a fortnight on comparing my list of sick with that of a surgeon belonging to one of the guardships allowing for the disproportion of numbers mine did not exceed his and yet notwithstanding this which is a well known fact the report of a most malignant disease still prevailed and so industriously was the report promulgated and kept alive by some evilminded people who either wished to throw an odium on the humane promoters of the plan or to give uneasiness to the friends and relations of those engaged in the expedition that letters from all quarters were pouring in upon us commiserating our state the newspapers were daily filled with alarming accounts of the fatality that prevailed among us and the rumor became general notwithstanding every step was taken to remove these fears by assurances which were strictly true that the whole fleet was in as good a state of health and as few in it would be found to be ill at that cold season of the year as even in the most healthy situation on shore the clearest testimony that there was more malignity in the report than in the disease may be deduced from the very inconsiderable number that have died since we left england which i may safely venture to say is much less than ever was known in so long a voyage the numbers being proportionate even though not laboring under the disadvantages we were subject to and the crowded state we were in  during the absence of captain phillip i mentioned to captain hunter of the sirius that i thought whitewashing with quick lime the parts of the ships where the convicts were confined would be the means of correcting and preventing that unwholesome dampness which usually appeared on the beams and sides of the ships and was occasioned by the breath of the people captain hunter agreed with me on the propriety of the step and with that obliging  may    his majestys ship the hyaena joined us this day and put herself under the command of captain phillip who had instructions to take her with him as far as he should think needful in the evening the sirius made the signal to weigh and attempted to get down to st helens but the wind shifting and several of the convoy not getting under way through some irregularity in the seamen she was obliged to anchor when this was done captain phillip sent lieutenant king on board the ships which had occasioned the detention who soon adjusted the difficulties that had arisen as they were found to proceed more from intoxication than from any nautical causes    th this morning the sirius and her convoy weighed again with an intention of going through st helens but the wind being fair for the needles we run through them with a pleasant breeze the charlotte captain gilbert on board of which i was sailing very heavy the hyaena took us in tow until she brought us ahead of the sirius and then cast us off    th an accident of a singular nature happened today corporal baker of the marines on laying a loaded musket down which he had just taken out of the arms chest was wounded by it in the inner ankle of the right foot the bones after being a good deal shattered turned the ball which taking another direction had still force enough left to go through a harnesscask full of beef at some distance and after that to kill two geese that were on the other side of it extraordinary as this incident may appear it is no less true the corporal being a young man and in a good habit of body i had the pleasure contrary to the general expectation of seeing him return to his duty in three months with the perfect use of the wounded joint   0th a discovery of a futile scheme formed by the convicts on board the scarborough was made by one of that body who had been recommended to captain hunter previous to our sailing they had laid a plan for making themselves masters of the ship but being prevented by this discovery two of the ringleaders were carried on board the sirius where they were punished and afterward put on    th departed this life ismael coleman a convict who worn out by lowness of spirits and debility brought on by long and close confinement resigned his breath without a pang   0th in the forenoon passed to the southward of madeira and saw some turtle of the hawksbill kind  june  d saw and passed the salvages these islands are not laid down in any of the charts we had on board except a small one by hamilton moore in the possession of the second mate they lie by our observation in lat  0  0 n long      w   d this evening after seeing many small fish in our way from the salvages we arrived at teneriffe and anchored in santa cruz road about a mile to the n e of the town of that name in sixteen fathom water some of the ships came to in twenty fathom we were visited the same night as is the custom of the port by the harbor master and gained permission to water and procure such refreshments as the island afforded the marines were now served with wine in lieu of spirits a pound of fresh beef was likewise daily distributed to them as well as to the convicts together with a pound of rice instead of bread and such vegetables as could be procured of the latter indeed the portion was rather scanty little besides onions being to be got and still less of fruit it being too early in the season   th captain phillip as governor of his majestys territories in new south wales and commander in chief of the expedition accompanied by twenty of the principal officers paid his respects to the marquis de brancifort governor of this and the other canary islands we were received by his excellency with great politeness and cordiality and after the ceremony of introduction was over he entered into familiar conversation with captain phillip on general topics in person the marquis is genteel he is rather above the middle size but cannot boast of much embonpoint his countenance is animated his deportment easy and graceful and both his appearance and manners perfectly correspond with the idea universally entertained of the dignity of a grandee of spain this accomplished nobleman as i have been informed is not a spaniard by birth but a sicilian and descended from some of the princes of that island on this ancestry and descent it is visible that he prides himself not a little the people he is placed over will have it that he carries himself with too much stateliness to be long a favorite there they cannot however help acknowledging that he preserves a degree of disinterestedness moderation and justice in his conduct toward them that is not to be objected to   th a convict named james clark died of a dropsy he had been tapped ten days before and discharged twelve quarts of water   th during the night while the people were busily employed in taking in water on board the alexander a service in which some of the convicts assisted one of them of the name of powel found means to drop himself unperceived into a small boat that lay alongside and under cover of the night to cast her off without discovery he then drifted to a dutch east indiaman that had just come to an anchor to the crew of which he told a plausible story and entreated to be taken on board but though they much wanted men they would have nothing to do with him having committed himself again to the waves he was driven by the wind and the current in the course of the night to a small island lying to leeward of the ships where he was the next morning taken the boat and oars which he could not conceal led to a discovery otherwise he would probably have effected his escape when brought back by the party sent after him captain phillip ordered him into irons in which state he remained for some time but at length by an artful petition he got written for him he so wrought on the governors humanity as to procure a release from his confinement  as you approach the island of teneriffe and even when you are near to it the appearance from the sea conveys no very favorable idea of its fertility one rugged barren hill or mountain terminating in another until it forms the famous peak the town of santa cruz is large and populous but very irregular and ill built some of the private houses however are spacious convenient and well constructed although this town is not considered as the capital laguna enjoying that preeminence yet i cannot help thinking it ought to be so not only from its being more frequented by ships of various nations and having a greater share of trade than any other port in the canaries but on account of its being the residence of the governorgeneral  among other steps for its improvement the marquis set on foot a contribution and from the produce of it has caused to be built an elegant and commodious mole or pier about the center of the town to this pier water of an excellent quality is conveyed by pipes so that boats may come alongside and by applying a hose to the cocks placed there for this purpose fill the casks without the usual trouble and fatigue the landing or shipping of goods is likewise by means of this pier rendered both convenient and expeditious in short i think i may safely recommend this port as a very good one for ships undertaking long voyages to water at and refresh their crews more especially in the time of the fruit season  about four or five miles inland from santa cruz stands the city of laguna so called from a lake near which it is situated this lake during the winter or in rainy weather is full of stagnant water that in a little time becomes putrid and in very dry hot weather is totally exhaled i have before observed that laguna is considered as the capital of the island and added my reasons for thinking this an illjudged distinction the road from santa cruz to it is a pretty steep ascent until you approach the town which is situated at the extremity or rather on a corner of a plain three or four miles long this city has two churches one of them richly ornamented and several convents both of friars and nuns it has likewise three hospitals two of which were originally instituted for the wise but ineffectual purpose of eradicating the lues venerea a disease that has long been and still continues to be very common in this island i was however informed that persons afflicted with other disorders are now received into these two charitable institutions and that the third is appropriated to the reception of foundlings besides the foregoing there are some other public as well as private buildings that tend to improve the appearance of the town there is very little trade carried on at laguna it being rather the retired residence of the gentry of the island and of the merchants of santa cruz which is the principal seat of commerce the officers of justice likewise reside here such as the corrigedor lieutenant of the police etc and a judge whose business it is to regulate commercial affairs an office of inquisition with the proper officers delegated from and subject to the tribunal of the holy office held at grand canary is besides established here  the present natives of this island seem to have in them very little of the stock from whence they sprung intermarriages with the spaniards have nearly obliterated all traces of the original stamina they are of a middle stature inclining to be slender and of a dark complexion with large animated black eyes the peasants in general are wretchedly clothed when they do appear better they are habited in the spanish fashion the men in a genteeler line dress very gaily and are seldom seen without long swords it is remarked that few of them walk with dignity and ease which may be attributed to the long cloaks they usually wear except on particular occasions  the women wear veils those worn by the lower ranks are of black stuff those of the higher of black silk and such among the latter as have any claim to beauty are far from being over careful in concealing their faces by them the young ladies some of whom i saw that were really pretty wear their fine long black hair plaited and fastened with a comb or a ribbon on the top of the head  the common people and in this they resemble the inhabitants of most of the islands in the pacific ocean lately discovered have a strong spice of furacity in them they are besides lazy and the most importunate beggars in the world i observed likewise that the itch was so common among them and had attained such a degree of virulence that one would almost be led to believe it was epidemic there  some of the women are so abandoned and shameless that it would be doing an injustice to the prostitutes met with in the streets of london to say they are like them the females of every degree are said to be of an amorous constitution and addicted to intrigue for which no houses could be better adapted than those in teneriffe  the manufactures carried on here are very few and the product of them little more than sufficient for their own consumption they consist of taffeties gauze coarse linens blankets a little silk and curious garters the principal dependence of the inhabitants is on their wine their staple commodity oil corn and every kind of stock for shipping with these the island abounds and in their season produces not only the tropical fruits but the vegetable productions of the european gardens in the greatest plenty teneriffe enjoys an agreeable and healthful mediocrity of climate indeed i know of none better adapted for the restoration of a valetudinarian as by going into the mountains he may graduate the air and choose that state of it which best suits his complaint but although the inhabitants are thus healthy and have so little occasion for medical aid they loudly complain of the want of knowledge in the professional gentlemen of the island  the present governor has established a manufactory of silk and woollen goods in the suburbs of santa cruz which is carried on by poor children old and infirm people and by abandoned females with a view to reclaiming them an institution that will ever do honor both to his excellency and to those who have liberally aided him in so laudable a scheme  like the inhabitants of most catholic countries the people of this island are very profuse in decorating their churches and even their dwellinghouses on the festivals held in honor of their saints this being corpus christi a day of much solemnity and parade i went on shore with lieutenant ball of the supply to see the procession incident to the occasion before we landed we formed a resolution to avoid as much as lay in our power giving offense even to the most zealous devotee but we found this was not to be done when we arrived at the church from whence the procession commenced the host was just making its appearance a circumstance that is announced by ringing of bells and firing of guns as it passed by us we fell on our knees as we observed those around us to do but it unfortunately happening that the spot we knelt upon consisted of sand intermixed with small rough pebbles the posture we were in soon became so exceedingly painful that in order to procure a momentary ease we only let one knee remain on the ground this heretical act did not escape the observation of one of the holy fathers all of whom were intent on the exact performance of every ceremonious etiquette it procured for us a frown from him and treatment that was not of the most civil kind so that in order to pacify him we again dropped on both knees he did not however pass on without exhibiting strong marks of ill nature and resentment in his countenance at this trivial and unintended breach of respectful attention to the religious rights of the country the procession in which the governor and all the principal inhabitants joined having passed through most of the streets returned with the same solemnity to the church it had set out from which was richly ornamented and splendidly illuminated with large wax tapers upon the occasion during our stay here his excellency the governor entertained captain phillip and all the officers belonging to the expedition with a very elegant dinner  before we sailed from the motherbank a sporatic disease had appeared among the marines and convicts on its first appearance it resembled the mumps or swellings of the chaps and as that distemper sometimes terminates in a translation of the inflammation to the testicles so this complaint after the swelling and induration of the jaws had subsided which usually happened on the sixth or seventh day never in one instance failed to fix on those parts and that in so very obstinate a manner as not to give way to the treatment generally found effectual in similar inflammations one of the convicts thus affected was seized with an intermitting fever between the paroxysm i gave him an emetic which had such a sudden and wonderful effect on this strange complaint that i was induced to repeat it and i found it effectual in this as well as in all subsequent cases as soon as we got to sea the motion of the ship acted on all those who were affected to the number of seventeen in a most surprising and extraordinary manner indeed it was so sudden that it was like a placebo i could never account with any satisfaction to myself for the origin of this uncommon disease though much acquainted with those incident to seamen nor did i ever see or hear of any that resembled it the most steady and prudent of the mariners even those who had their wives on board were equally affected with those who led more irregular lives at first i attributed it to the verdigrease that might gather on the copper utensils wherein the provisions were cooked but i am now fully persuaded that this was not the source from which it proceeded for at the very time it was most prevalent and attended with the greatest degree of inveteracy the coppers were cleaned and made as bright as they could be every day under my own inspection another proof and a very strong one that it did not proceed from the beforementioned cause is that the provisions still continued to be dressed in the same coppers when the smallest trace of the disease was no longer to be perceived which was the case after being four or five days at sea   th p m the sirius made the signal for all officers to repair on board their respective ships an officer was likewise sent to the governor to inform him that we intended to put to sea in the morning and at the same time to thank him for the civilities and politeness he had shown us his excellency returned in answer to this message that his best and most sincere good wishes should attend us and that he should ever feel a very particular interest in our success which he hoped would answer the intention of government and the expectations of those who had so cheerfully entered as volunteers on so novel and very uncertain a service   0th this morning the fleet got under way with a light breeze which carried us out of santa cruz but left us two days becalmed between teneriffe and the grand canary after this a fine breeze sprung up from the northeast and no occurrence worthy of notice happened for some days we crossed the tropical line in     0 west longitude and was nearly pressed on board the lady penrhynn transport whose people did not attend to her steerage being deeply engaged in sluicing and ducking all those on board who had never crossed it    th in the morning saw a strange sail to the northward and at night the sirius made the signal for the convoy to shorten sail    th early this morning the sirius threw out the supplys signal to make sail and look out ahead she immediately obeyed and at eight oclock made the signal for seeing land which was repeated by the sirius to the convoy at eleven we passed the isle of sal in lat       n long      w and in the evening bonavista two of the cape de verd islands a cluster of islands so called from a cape of that name situated opposite to them on the continent of africa we passed the latter island so close that we saw the breakers which endangered captain cooks ship in his last voyage it blew at the time pretty fresh and was so hazy that we could make no other observation than that the land was high and the shore what we could perceive of it through the haze for the horizon line did not exceed two miles had a white appearance as if sand or chalk cliffs at six in the evening the sirius made a signal for the convoy to observe a close order of sailing and to shorten sail for the night and at twelve running under an easy sail she made the signal for the ships to bring to with their heads to the southeast    th at day break we made fail the supply being ahead on the lookout at eight oclock she made the signal for seeing land which proved to be the isle of mayo another of the cape de verd islands lying in lat     0 n long    w the sirius now made the signal to prepare to anchor which was followed by one that the boats from the victuallers and transports may land as soon as the ships came to an anchor without asking permission as at teneriffe we ran down the east side of the island close in with the shore on which we could perceive a high surf or rather the sea breaking violently among the rocks the haze still continued so thick that we could only observe the shore to be rough craggy and bold and that several parts of the island seemed high and mountainous at twelve through the haze saw the island of saint jago the principal of the cape de verd islands lying in lat       n long       w half after one the sirius leading into port praya bay on a sudden brought to as we imagined to wait for the sternmost ships which as they all came up likewise brought to on the outside of the entrance into the bay after the preparations which had been made for anchoring and the disposition shown by the sirius to run in we were not a little surprised to see her at two oclock throw out the signal for the convoy to keep nearer the commanding officer then make sail and bear away steering southwest at six in the evening we lost sight of the island running with a smart topgallant and steering sail breeze at northeast a small portugueze brig lay at anchor in por praya which was the only vessel of any kind at that time there this bay is rendered memorable by the action that took place there on the   th of april      between commodore johnstone and monsieur suffrein in giving an account of which the french admiral in a letter said to be written by him humorously thus observes in leading into the bay i was some time at a loss to distinguish which was the commodores ship but on getting more in i at length saw his pendant blushing through a forest of masts the romney being securely placed in shore of the merchant ships and smaller men of war  the entrance into this bay appeared to be about a mile between two bluff points which makes it secure from every wind except a southerly one and when that prevails a very high sea tumbles into it on an eminence in the center of the bay stands a fort where the portugueze colors were displayed many people appeared on the batteries looking at the ships which were probably more in number than had been seen there since the memorable   th of april the appearance of the town and the island from the distant view we had gave us no very favorable opinion of them the face of the country seemed to be sterile in the extreme the lifeless brown of the isle of mayo described by captain cook may very well be applied to this island for as far as my eye or glass could reach not the smallest trace of vegetation or verdure was to be perceived except at the west end of the fort on the left side of the bay where a few trees of the cocoa nut or palm kind appeared but notwithstanding the sterile picture it exhibits when viewed from the sea geographers and those who have been on shore describe it to be in many places well cultivated and very fertile producing sugar canes a little wine some cotton indian corn cocoa nuts and oranges with all the other tropical fruits in great plenty and point it out as a place where ships bound on long voyages may be conveniently supplied with water and other necessaries such as fowls goats and hogs all which are to be purchased at a very easy rate   0th this evening standing to the southward with all sail the wind moderate the air warm and damp with haze the sirius made the alexanders signal who had dropped considerably astern and reprimanded the master for hoisting out a boat without permission the two following days the weather was moderately warm with some flashes of lightning    d the weather became exceedingly dark warm and close with heavy rain a temperature of the atmosphere very common on approaching the equator and very much to be dreaded as the health is greatly endangered thereby every attention was therefore paid to the people on board the charlotte and every exertion used to keep her clean and wholesome between decks my first care was to keep the men as far as was consistent with a regular discharge of their duty out of the rain and i never suffered the convicts to come upon deck when it rained as they had neither linen nor clothing sufficient to make themselves dry and comfortable after getting wet a line of conduct which cannot be too strictly observed and enforced in those latitudes to this and to the frequent use of oil of tar which was used three times a week and oftener if found necessary i attribute in a great degree the uncommon good health we enjoyed i most sincerely wish oil of tar was in more general use throughout his majestys navy than it is if it were i am certain that the advantage accruing from it to the health of seamen that truly useful and valuable class of the community and for whose preservation too much cannot be done would soon manifest itself this efficacious remedy wonderfully resists putrefaction destroys vermin and insects of every kind wherever it is applied overcomes all disagreeable smells and is in itself both agreeable and wholesome  in the evening it became calm with distant peals of thunder and the most vivid flashes of lightning i ever remember the weather was now so immoderately hot that the female convicts perfectly overcome with it frequently fainted away and these faintings generally terminated in fits and yet notwithstanding the enervating effects of the atmospheric heat and the inconveniences they suffered from it so predominant was the warmth of their constitutions or the depravity of their hearts that the hatches over the place where they were confined could not be suffered to lay off during the night without a promiscuous intercourse immediately taking place between them and the seamen and marines what little wind there was which was only at intervals continuing adverse and the health of these wretches being still endangered by the heat captain phillip though anxious to prevent as much as possible this intercourse gave an order on my representing the necessity of it that a grating should be cut so as to admit a small wind sail being let down among them in some of the other ships the desire of the women to be with the men was so uncontrollable that neither shame but indeed of this they had long lost sight nor the fear of punishment could deter them from making their way through the bulk heads to the apartments assigned the seamen    th still inclinable to calms in lat    0 n long       w we perceived a strong current setting to the northwest so that on the following day though by our log we had run thirty miles south by east yet by observation we found ourselves in lat      which shows the current against us to be nearly a knot an hour i visited the different transports and found the troops and convicts    th still calm with loud thunder and incessant heavy rain    th a gentle breeze sprung up to the westward and the next day about eleven in the forenoon we saw a strange sail standing to the southwest at twelve she tacked stood toward us and hoisted portugueze colors the sirius spoke her after which we all made sail again steering southeast by east  july  d the wind continuing southerly in latitude      n and being still so far to the eastward as  0    w longitude the sirius made the signal for the convoy to tack and stood to the westward this day we saw some remarkable flights of flying fish they were so very numerous as to resemble flights of small birds the poor creatures were so closely pursued on all sides by their common enemy bonitoes albacores and skipjacks that their wings availed them little the succeeding night was a continuation of heavy rain every evening while we continued between nine and six degrees of north latitude we were baffled with calms and adverse winds for seven days together i observed that each day generally closed with heavy rains and some squalls of wind which were always remarked to be from the northward   th the wind southwest by south the fleet tacked by signal and stood to the eastward in the evening a more numerous shoal of porpoises than ever remembered to be seen by the oldest seaman on board presented themselves to our view they were as we conjectured in pursuit of some wounded fish and so very intent were they on the object of their chase that they passed through the fleet and close to some of the ships without showing any disposition to avoid them the sailors and mariners compared them to a numerous pack of hounds scouring through watery ground and indeed when the rays of the sun beamed upon them i know not what they resembled more the weather being moderate i went round the ships and was really surprised considering the damp and unfavourable weather we had had to find the people look so well and to be in so good a state of health   th in lat      n long       w the wind s s w we tacked by signal and in the course of the day spoke a sloop bound to the coast of africa belonging to the house of mether in london had been out four months and was then standing to the westward  the wind continuing adverse and the fleet making little progress in their voyage captain phillip put the officers seamen marines and convicts to an allowance of three pints of water per day not including a quart allowed each man a day for boiling pease and oatmeal a quantity scarcely sufficient to supply that waste of animal spirits the body must necessarily undergo in the torrid zone from a constant and violent perspiration and a diet consisting of salt provisions necessity however has no law in this instance as well as in every other and i am fully persuaded the commander acted upon this occasion from the best of motives and for the good of the whole were it by any means possible people subject to long voyages should never be put to a short allowance of water for i am satisfied that a liberal use of it when freed from the foul air and made sweet by a machine now in use on board his majestys navy will tend to prevent a scorbutic habit as much if not more than any thing we are acquainted with my own experience in the navy has convinced me that when scorbutic patients are restrained in the use of water which i believe is never the case but through absolute necessity and they have nothing to live on but the ships provision the surgeons necessaries being illchosen and very inadequate to the wise and salutary purposes for which government intended them all the antiseptics and antiscorbutics we know of will avail very little in a disease so much to be guarded against and dreaded by seamen in one of his majestys ships i was liberally supplied with that powerful antiscorbutic essence of malt we had also sour krout and besides these every remedy that could be comprised in the small compass of a medicine chest yet when necessity forced us to a short allowance of water although aware of the consequence i freely administered the essence etc as a preservative the scurvy made its appearance with such hasty and rapid strides that all attempts to check it proved fruitless until good fortune threw a ship in our way who spared us a sufficient quantity of water to serve the sick with as much as they could use and to increase the ships allowance to the seamen this fortunate and very seasonable supply added to the free use of the essence of malt etc which i had before strictly adhered to made in a few days so sudden a change for the better in the poor fellows who had been covered with ulcers and livid blotches that every person on board was surprised at it and in a fortnight after when we got into port there was not a man in the ship though at the time we received the water the gums of some of them were formed into such a fungus as nearly to envelope the teeth but what had every appearance of health   th dark cloudy unpleasant sultry weather the wind fouth by east we saw many fish and caught two bonitoes the boatswain struck with a pair of grains out of the cabin window a most beautiful fish about ten pounds weight in shape it a good deal resembled a salmon with this difference that its tail was more forked it was in color of a lovely yellow and when first taken out of the water it had two beautiful stripes of green on each side which some minutes after changed to a delightful blue and so continued in the internal formation of this fish i observed nothing particular except that its heart was larger and its respirations contracted and dilated longer than i had ever seen before in any aquatic animal a tortoise not excepted as we were at a loss what appellation to give it having never met with a fish of this species and it being a nondescript the sailors gave it the name of the yellow tail   th the wind still s by e in lat      n long    w we saw a large vessel standing to the northward under a press of sail her colors though at a considerable distance were judged to be imperial again saw fish of various kinds in chase of the flying fish whose enemies seem to be innumerable in order to avoid being devoured by their pursuers they frequently sought for shelter in the ships but much oftener flew with such force against their sides as to drop lifeless into the water we caught three fine bonitoes and thereby rid the poor flying fish whose wings seemed to excite the enmity of all the larger finny race of three formidable enemies   th and  0th caught a great number of fish as did the alexander who was near us at night in the wake of the ship the sea appeared quite luminous a phenomenon we attributed to the spawn of the fish which surrounded us on all sides    th about five in the evening we crossed the equator without any wish or inclination being shown by the seamen to observe the ceremony usually practiced in passing under it the longitude was       w the wind at east the weather moderate and clear in lat      s long       w the boatswain caught sixteen fine bonitoes which proved a very seasonable and acceptable supply at night the sea all around the ship exhibited a most delightful sight this appearance was occasioned by the gambols of an incredible number of various kinds of fish who sported about us and whose sudden turnings caused an emanation which resembled flashes of lightning darting in quick succession what i before spoke of as the spawn i am now fully convinced were rather the fish themselves turning up their white bellies at some little distance below the surface of the water and these sudden evolutions were what gave the sea the luminous appearance observed on it before i can the more readily affirm this to be the cause as one evening when we had immense quantities about us i carefully attended to them till it became dark and was fully satisfied from the observations i was then able to make that it was the fish and not the spawn which occasioned the appearance for there was not an officer or person on board but what was able very plainly to perceive their frolicsome turnings and windings indeed some of them came so near the surface that we frequently attempted to strike them with a pair of grains    th being informed that several of the mariners and convicts on board the alexander were suddenly taken ill i immediately visited that ship and found that the illness complained of was wholly occasioned by the bilge water which had by some means or other risen to so great a height that the pannels of the cabin and the buttons on the clothes of the officers were turned nearly black by the noxious effluvia when the hatches were taken off the stench was so powerful that it was scarcely possible to stand over them how it could have got to this height is very strange for i well know that captain phillip gave strict orders which orders i myself delivered to the masters of the transports to pump the ships out daily in order to keep them sweet and wholesome and it was added that if the ships did not make water enough for that purpose they were to employ the convicts in throwing water into the well and pumping it out again until it became clear and untinged the peoples health however being endangered by the circumstance i found a representation upon the subject to captain phillip needful and accordingly went on board the sirius for that purpose captain phillip who upon every occasion showed great humanity and attention to the people with the most obliging readiness sent mr king one of his lieutenants on board the alexander with me in order to examine into the state of the ship charging him at the same time with the most positive and pointed instructions to the master of the ship instantly to set about sweetening and purifying her this commission mr king executed with great propriety and expedition and by the directions he gave such effectual means were made use of that the evil was soon corrected and not long after all the people who suffering from the effects of it were under mr balmain my assistants care got quite rid of the complaint i now returned to the sirius and solicited an increase of water which captain phillip with equal readiness complied with and as we had by this time got into a regular southeast trade wind our allowance served tolerably well every man having three quarts a day    d the weather moderate and cloudy in lat     s long      w we saw a noddy and two pintado birds at night the commanding officer of marines having received information that three men had made their way through the hole cut for the admission of the windsail into the apartment of the female convicts against an express order issued for that purpose he apprehended them and put them in confinement for trial    d the weather being dark and cloudy with heavy rain and strong breezes the sirius carried away her maintopsailyard in the slings which however in a little time she got replaced in the evening we saw some grampuses sporting about    th in latitude       south the sirius made the signal for the longitude by lunar observation which was found to be       w strong breezes and cloudy weather the borrowdale victualler carried away her foretopgallantmast this evening we observed some flying fish very different from those we had before seen they had wings on both the head and tail and when in the act of flying were said by our people to resemble a doubleheaded shot about six oclock the alexander brought to and hoisted out a boat in order to pick up a man who had fallen over board from the spanker boom but as he sunk before the boat could reach him the attempt proved ineffectual    th the sirius made the signal to close and keep nearer the commanding officer the weather rainy and unsettled with strong breezes and a heavy swell from the eastward    th fresh breezes and cloudy weather at ten in the morning the sirius made the supplys signal to come within hail and desired the commanding officer to acquaint the different transports that in the track we then were lat      s long      w there were some sunken rocks for which we were directed to keep a good lookout this signal was followed by one for the ships to take their proper stations in the order of sailing and for the lady penrhyn who was considerably to windward and astern withal to come into the wake of the sirius after these orders were complied with we bore away steering s by w the wind e s e   0th the supply hailed us and acquainted me that a female convict on board the prince of wales had met with an accident which endangered her life it being then nearly dark and the ships making quick way through the water it was judged imprudent to hoist a boat out lieutenant ball of the supply therefore promised to send a boat early  august  st in latitude       s captain phillip for the first time displayed his broad pendant and in the evening made the signal for the longitude which being considerably astern we could not discern   d early in the morning passed and spoke a portugueze brig steering the same course with us which was to the coast of brazil she sailed so very dull that we passed her as if she lay at anchor although we had not a fast sailing ship in the fleet at eight in the morning saw a ganet which are seldom seen out of soundings being now in expectation of soon seeing land the commodore made the supplys signal to look out ahead and the alexanders and prince of waless to take their station in the order of sailing being too far ahead at three in the afternoon the supply made the signal for seeing land which was repeated by the commodore to the convoy at nine at night being well in with cape frio we shortened sail running at an easy rate until morning when the wind was little and variable   d this evening finding it impossible to get hold of anchorage the commodore dispatched lieutenant king in the supply which sailed well in light winds to the viceroy with information that he was with his convoy arrived near the mouth of the harbor he then made the signal for the ships to bring to with their heads to the fouthward about six miles from the shore rio de janeiro sugar loaf bearing west half north distant about six leagues in the course of the day we saw many whales playing about   th this morning standing in for the harbor the wind headed us which obliged us to tack and stand out to sea a little in order to prevent our falling to leeward of the port which it would have been no easy matter to have regained   th still calm this morning a boat came alongside in which were three portugueze and six slaves from whom we purchased some oranges plantains and bread in trafficking with these people we discovered that one thomas barret a convict had with great ingenuity and address passed some quarter dollars which he assisted by two others had coined out of old buckles buttons belonging to the marines and pewter spoons during their passage from teneriffe the impression milling character in a word the whole was so inimitably executed that had their metal been a little better the fraud i am convinced would have passed undetected a strict and careful search was made for the apparatus wherewith this was done but in vain not the smallest trace or vestige of any thing of the kind was to be found among them how they managed this business without discovery or how they could effect it at all is a matter of inexpressible surprise to me as they never were suffered to come near a fire and a sentinel was constantly placed over their hatchway which one would imagine rendered it impossible for either fire or fused metal to be conveyed into their apartments besides hardly ten minutes ever elapsed without an officer of some degree or other going down among them the adroitness therefore with which they must have managed in order to complete a business that required so complicated a process gave me a high opinion of their ingenuity cunning caution and address and i could not help wishing that these qualities had been employed to more laudable purposes the officers of marines the master of the ship and myself fully explained to the injured portugueze what villians they were who had imposed upon them we were not without apprehensions that they might entertain an unfavourable opinion of englishmen in general from the conduct of these rascals we therefore thought it necessary to acquaint them that the perpetrators of the fraud were felons doomed to transportation by the laws of their country for having committed similar offenses there  about one oclock a gentle breeze from the east carried us within about a mile of the bar where at nine oclock we anchored in sixteen fathom water the calms had baffled the supply so much that she had only dropped her anchor a little while before us   th early this morning it being quite calm the commodore dispatched an officer to the viceroy who met with a courteous reception and about eleven oclock returned with the boat nearly full of fruit and vegetables sent as presents to the commodore from some of his old friends and acquaintance some years ago captain phillip was on this coast commander of a portugueze man of war during that time he performed several gallant acts which aided by his other amiable qualities rendered him extremely popular here and recommended him to the notice of the court of lisbon shortly after his own country having a claim to his services on the breaking out of a war he declined a command offered him by the portugueze and returned to the english navy where he served some time as lieutenant a rank he had held before he had engaged in the service of portugal on board the alexander under the command of that brave and exemplary character lord longford  about two oclock we got under way with a gentle seabreeze which ran us into the harbor in passing santa cruz fort the commodore saluted it with thirteen guns which was returned with an equal number this day a portugueze ship sailed for lisbon which gave us an opportunity of writing short letters to our friends in england   th in the forenoon the commodore attended by most of the officers on the expedition paid the viceroy a visit of ceremony on our landing we were received by an officer and a friar who conducted us to the palace as we passed the guard on duty there the colors were laid at the feet of the commodore than which nothing could have been a higher token of respect we then proceeded up stairs into a large antichamber crowded with officers soldiers and domestics here we were received by several officers belonging to the household and the surgeongeneral to the army who spoke good english having acquired his professional knowledge in london a few minutes after our arrival a curtain which hung over the door of the presence chamber was drawn aside and on our entrance we were individually introduced to the viceroy by the commodore the ceremony being ended and a short conversation having taken place we were ushered into another spacious room where we all sat down i could not help remarking that the viceroy placed himself in such a manner as to have his back turned on most of the officers i was told afterward that he apologized for this but i did not hear him though very near neither the room we were now in nor that into which we were first introduced exhibited any marks of magnificence or elegance i acknowledge that for my own part i was exceedingly disappointed from the parade without such as the number of guards etc i was led to suppose that we should find every thing within the palace proportionably magnificent and princely but this was by no means the case the only furniture i saw in the room we were in except chairs were six card tables and portraits of two of the sovereigns of portugal one of which was that of king sebastian the first the other of her present majesty the former placed in the center the latter at the upper end of the room the viceroy appeared to be of a middle age somewhere between forty and fifty stout and corpulent with a strong cast or defect in both his eyes he seemed to be a person of few words but at the same time civil and attentive i could not however help observing the very great difference there was between his excellencys manner and address and that of the elegant and accomplished marquis de brancifort   th the contract being settled the commissary supplied the troops and convicts with rice in lieu of bread with fresh beef vegetables and oranges which soon removed every symptom of the scurvy prevalent among them    th the commodore ordered six female convicts who had behaved well to be removed from the friendship into the charlotte and at the same time an equal number whose conduct was more exceptionable to be returned to the friendship in their stead the commodores view was a matter not easily accomplished to separate those whose decent behavior entitled them to some favor from those who were totally abandoned and obdurate    th cornelius connell a private in the marines was according to the sentence of a court martial punished with a hundred lashes for having an improper intercourse with some of the female convicts contrary to orders thomas jones was also sentenced to receive three hundred lashes for attempting to make a sentinel betray his trust in suffering him to go among the women but in consideration of the good character he bore previous to this circumstance the court recommended him to the clemency of the commanding officer and in consequence thereof he was forgiven john jones and james reiley privates accused of similar offenses to that of connells were acquitted for want of evidence there being no witnesses to support the charge except convicts whose testimony could not be admitted    th this being a day of great parade and gaiety with the portugueze the inhabitants of rio de janeiro arrayed in their best and richest attire as their custom is on regale days began to show themselves during the forenoon between the city and the church of st gloria which is about a mile distant and situated on a rising ground near the sea persons of all ranks as well in carriages as equestrians and pedestrians joined in the crowd but what was the purpose of this cavalcade or to what circumstances it owed its origin i am still at a loss to know gloria church which is rather neat than rich was decorated with various flowers in the disposal of which some taste was displayed and most brilliantly illuminated i observed that the multitude generally stopped here in succession and employed themselves in some religious ceremonies such as praying and singing hymns before they returned to the city this kind of parade was continued the whole day the better sort of people however made their appearance only in the afternoon returning with the rest of the crowd after it was dark to the town i perceived a small church in one of the bye streets richly ornamented and elegantly illuminated as i saw men women and children struggling for entrance i joined in the throng out of mere curiosity and with no little difficulty made my way in but all the satisfaction i reaped from being thus squeezed and jostled was seeing such as could gain admission fall on their knees and praying with more fervor to appearance than real devotion on one side of the church stood a shabby illlooking fellow selling to the multitude consecrated beads as did another on the outside of the door i own i could not help resembling them to mountebanks vending and distributing their nostrums there were many more of these religious hawkers in the streets from some of whom as i saw it was the custom i purchased a few of their beads at a little distance from the door of the church was erected a stage on which was placed a band of vocal and instrumental performers who exerted themselves with might and main to please the surrounding audience i cannot however say that they succeeded in pleasing me about ten oclock a display of fireworks and rockets of which the portugueze seem to be very fond concluded the entertainments of the day some intrigues i have reason to believe followed i was led to this conclusion from seeing many welldressed women in the crowd quite unattended and this was the only time during my stay in the country that i ever saw any circumstances which could warrant my forming such an opinion i know it has been asserted by some writers that the women of rio de janeiro are not uncensurable in this point they have affirmed that as soon as it became dark the generality of them exposed themselves at their doors and windows distinguishing by presents of nosegays and flowers those on whom they had no objection to bestow their favors a distinction in which strangers shared as well as their acquaintance that this might have been the case i will not take upon me to deny and impressed with the idea on my first arrival i considered every woman as a proper object of gallantry but a months residence among them convinced me that this imputed turn for intrigue is chiefly confined to the lower class and that in general the higher ranks are as undeserving of the imputation as the females of any other country  the popularity of our commodore with the viceroy and principal inhabitants here procured for the officers the liberty of going wherever they pleased it has always been the custom for a soldier to follow every foreign officer that landed at this port and it was scarcely ever dispensed with it was however unknown to us and this unaccustomed liberty gave us an opportunity of inspecting more minutely into the manners and disposition of the women as well as the men    st this being the prince of brazils birthday the commodore with most of his officers went to court to compliment the viceroy on the occasion as soon as we landed we were received by an officer who conducted us to the presence chamber where his excellency stood under a canopy of state receiving the compliments of the officers of the garrison the principal inhabitants and such foreigners as were in the place after having paid our respects we withdrew as did every other person except the principal officers of state some general and law officers and those of the governors household the sirius and one of the forts fired royal salutes the court was brilliant if a place where a female does not appear can be said to be brilliant but this i was informed is always the case here those gentlemen who appeared in the circle were richly and elegantly dressed the officers of the army and of the militia were particularly so and that in a style and fashion which did no small credit to their taste the viceroy wore a scarlet coat trimmed with very broad rich gold lace and his hair according to his usual mode of wearing it in a remarkable long queue with very little powder an article of dress to which i observed the portugueze were not very partial while on the contrary they were profuse in the use of pomatum the day ended without any other demonstrations of joy as the    st james baker a private marine received two hundred lashes agreeable to the sentence of a court martial for endeavoring to get passed on shore by means of one of the seamen a spurious dollar knowing it to be so and one he had undoubtedly got from some of the convicts as it was of a similar base metal to those which they had coined during the passage and had attempted to put off on our first arrival at this port  september  st having now procured every thing at rio de janeiro that we stood in need of and thoroughly recovered and refreshed our people the commodore with such officers of the fleet as could be spared from duty waited on the viceroy to take leave and to return our acknowledgments for the indulgence and attention shown us which i think we may say we experienced in a greater extent and latitude than any foreigners had ever before done on our landing the same officer who had attended us upon every other public occasion conducted us to the presence chamber as we passed every military and public honor was paid to the commodore the colors were laid at his feet as they hitherto had been whenever he landed in his public character a token of respect that is never bestowed on any person but the governor himself when we arrived at the palace an officer of the household who was waiting to receive us conducted us through a most delightful recess hung round with birdcages whose inhabitants seemed to vie with each other both in the melody of their notes and the beauty of their plumage the passage we walked through was adorned on each side with odoriferous flowers and aromatic shrubs which while they charmed the eye spread a delightful fragrance around this passage led to a private room on the outside of the door of which we were received by the viceroy who stood uncovered and noticed each person separately in the most friendly and polite manner his excellency preceded us into the room and having requested all of us to be seated placed himself by the commodore in a position that fronted us in return for our thanks and acknowledgments he said it gave him infinite pleasure and satisfaction to find that the place had afforded us the supplies we stood in need of to this he added that the attention of the inhabitants which we were good enough to notice was much short of his wishes we then arose and took our leave but not before his excellency had expressed a desire of hearing from the commodore with an account of his success in the establishment of the new colony he concluded with saying that he hoped nay did not doubt from the character the english bore for generosity of disposition but that those who had so cheerfully engaged in a service strange and uncertain in itself would meet with an adequate reward  a recompense that every one must allow they justly merited the room in which the governor received us was that wherein he usually sat in his retired moments it was furnished and painted in a neat and elegant style the roof displaying wellexecuted representations of all the tropical fruits and the most beautiful birds of the country the walls were hung round with prints chiefly on religious subjects  rio de janeiro is said to derive its name from being discovered on st januariuss day it is the capital of the portugueze settlements in south america and is situated on the west side of a river or more properly in my opinion of a bay except that part which fronts the water the city is surrounded by high mountains of the most romantic form the imagination can fashion to itself any idea of the plan on which it is built has some claim to merit the principal street called strait street runs from the viceroys palace which is near the southeast end of the town to the northwest extremity where it is terminated by a large convent belonging to the benedictine friars situated on an eminence the street is broad well built and has in it a great number of handsome shops all the others are much inferior to this being in general only wide enough to admit two carriages to pass each other in the center the pavement for footpassengers except in strait street which is without any is so very unsociably narrow that two persons cannot walk with convenience together the houses are commonly two and sometimes three stories high of which even though inhabited by the most wealthy and respectable families the lower part is always appropriated to shops and to the use of the servants and slaves who are here extremely numerous the family rather choosing to reside in the upper part that they might live in a less confined air to every house there is a balcony with latticework before it and the same before all the windows  the churches are very numerous elegant and richly decorated some of them are built and ornamented in a modern style and that in a manner which proclaims the genius taste and judgment of the architects and artists two or three of the handsomest are at this time either unfinished or repairing and they appear to go on but very slowly notwithstanding large sums are constantly collecting for their completion as they are erected or repaired by charitable contributions public processions are frequently made for that purpose and the mendicant friars belonging to them likewise exert themselves in their line at these processions which are not unfrequent persons of every age and description assist they usually take place after it is dark when those who join in it are dressed in a kind of cloak adapted to religious purposes and carry a lanthorn fixed at the end of a pole of a convenient length so that upon these occasions you sometimes see three or four hundred moving lights in the streets at the same time which has an uncommon and a pleasing effect considerable sums are collected by this mode at the corner of every street about ten feet from the ground is placed the image of a saint which is the object of the common peoples adoration  the town is well supplied with water from the neighboring mountains which is conveyed over a deep valley by an aqueduct formed of arches of a stupendous height and from thence distributed by pipes to many parts of the city the principal fountain is close to the sea in a kind of square near the palace where ships water at a good wharf nearly in the same manner as at teneriffe and with equal expedition and convenience on the opposite side of the fountain are cocks from which the people in the neighborhood are supplied this convenient and capital watering place is so near the palace that when disputes or contentions arise between the boats crews of different ships the slaves etc they are suppressed and adjusted by the soldiers on guard who in the portugueze service have great power and often treat the people with no little severity  while we staid at this place we made several short excursions into the country but did not go near the mines as we knew the attempt would not only prove hazardous but ineffectual and as the liberty and indulgence granted us was on the commodores account we never extended our trips beyond a few miles lest our doing so should appear suspicious and reflect discredit on him we considering him in some degree responsible for our conduct as far as we did go we experienced the same polite and attentive behavior we met with from the inhabitants of the city never was more distinguished urbanity shown to strangers than was shown to us by every rank  from its complicated state i could learn but few particulars relative to the government of brazil the viceroy is invested with great power and authority subject in some cases to an appeal to the court of lisbon but like a wise and prudent ruler he seldom exerts it unless in instances where sound judgment and true policy render it expedient and necessary he is a man of little parade and appears not to be very fond of pomp and grandeur except on public days when it is not to be dispensed with when he goes abroad for amusement or to take the air his guard consists only of seven dragoons but on public occasions he makes his appearance in a grander style i once saw him go in state to one of the courts of justice and though it was situated not a hundred yards from his palace he was attended by a troop of horse his state carriage is tolerably neat but by no means elegant or superb it was drawn by four horses irregularly mottled  carriages are pretty common at this place there is scarcely a family of respectability without one they are mostly of the chaise kind and drawn in general by mules which are found to answer better than horses being more indefatigable and surer footed consequently better calculated to ascend their steep hills and mountains  the military force of brazil consists of a troop of horse which serve as guards for the viceroy twelve regiments of regulars from europe and six raised in the country these last enlist men of a mixed color which the former are by no means suffered to do besides the foregoing there are twelve regiments of militia always embodied this whole force regulars and militia except those on outposts and other needful duties appear early in the morning on every first day of the month before the palace where they undergo a general muster and review of arms and necessaries the private men although they are considered as persons of great consequence by the populace are on the other hand equally submissive and obedient to their officers this strict discipline and regularity as the city is in a great measure under military orders renders the inhabitants extremely civil and polite to the officers who in return study to be on the most agreeable and happy terms with them  a captains guard independent of the cavalry who are always in readiness to attend the viceroy is mounted every day at the palace whenever commodore phillip passed which he did as seldom as possible the guard was turned out with colors etc and as i before observed the same mark of honor paid to him as to the governor to obviate this trouble and ceremony he most frequently landed and embarked at the northwest side of the town where his boat constantly waited for him  on both sides of the river which forms the bay or harbor the country is picturesque and beautiful to a degree abounding with the most luxuriant flowers and aromatic shrubs birds of a lovely and rich plumage are seen hopping from tree to tree in great numbers together with an endless variety of insects whose exquisite beauty and gaudy colors exceed all description there is little appearance of cultivation in the parts we visited the land seemed chiefly pasturage the cattle here are small and when killed do not produce such beef as is to be met with in england it is not however by any means so bad as represented by some travelers to be on the contrary i have seen and eat here tolerably good sweet and welltasted beef i never saw any mutton they have indeed a few sheep but they are small thin and lean the gardens furnish most sorts of european productions such as cabbages lettuce parsley leeks white radishes beans pease kidney beans turnips water melons excellent pumpkins and pineapples of a small and indifferent kind the country likewise produces in the most unbounded degree limes acid and sweet lemons oranges of an immense size and exquisite flavor plantains bananas yams cocoanuts cashoo apples and nuts and some mangos for the use of the slaves and poorer sort of people the capado is cultivated in great plenty but this cannot be done through a want of corn for bread as i never saw finer flour than at this place which is plentiful and remarkably cheap  brazil particularly toward the northern parts furnishes a number of excellent drugs in the shops of the druggists and apothecaries of rio de janeiro of which there are many hippo oil of castor balsam capiva with most of the valuable gums and all of an excellent quality are to be found but they are sold at a much dearer rate than could possibly have been conceived or expected in a country of which they are the natural produce  the riches of this country arising from the mines are certainly very great to go near or to get a sight of these inexhaustible treasuries is impossible as every pass leading to them is strongly guarded and even a person taken on the road unless he be able to give a clear and unequivocal account of himself and his business is imprisoned and perhaps compelled ever after to work in those subterraneous cavities which avarice or an illtimed and fatal curiosity may have prompted him to approach these circumstances made a trial to see them without permission and that permission i understand has never been granted the most favored foreigners too dangerous to be attempted  in addition to the above source of wealth the country produces excellent tobacco and likewise sugar canes from which the inhabitants make good sugar and draw a spirit called aquadente this spirit by proper management and being kept till it is of a proper age becomes tolerable rum as it is sold very cheap the commodore purchased a hundred pipes of it for the use of the garrison when arrived at new south wales precious and valuable stones are also found here indeed they are so very plenty that a certain quantity only is suffered to be collected annually at the jewellers and lapidaries of which occupation there are many in rio i saw some valuable diamonds and a great number of excellent topazes with many other sorts of stones of inferior value several topazes were purchased by myself and others but we chose to buy them wrought in order to avoid imposition which is not unfrequent when the stones are sold in a rough state one of the principal streets of this city is nearly occupied by jewellers and the workers of these stones and i observed that persons of a similar profession generally resided in the same street  the manufactures here are very few and those by no means extensive all kinds of european goods sell at an immoderate price notwithstanding the shops are well stored with them  the brazil or native indians are very adroit at making elegant cotton hammocks of various dies and forms it was formerly the custom for the principal people of rio to be carried about in these hammocks but that fashion is succeeded by the use of sedan chairs which are now very common among them but they are of a more clumsy form than those used in england the chair is suspended from an awkward piece of wood borne on the shoulders of two slaves and elevated sufficiently to be clear of the inequalities of the street in carrying the foremost slave takes the pavement and the other the street one keeping a little before the other so that the chair is moved forward in a sidelong direction and very unlike the procedure of the london chairmen these fellows who get on at a great rate never take the wall of the footpassengers nor incommode them in the smallest degree  the inhabitants in general are a pleasant cheerful people inclining more to corpulency than those of portugal and as far as we could judge very favorably inclined to the english the men are strait and wellproportioned they do not accustom themselves to high living nor indulge much in the juice of the grape  the women when young are remarkably thin pale and delicately shaped but after marriage they generally incline to be lusty without losing that constitutional pale or rather sallow appearance they have regular and better teeth than are usually observable in warm climates where sweet productions are plentiful they have likewise the most lovely piercing dark eyes in the captivating use of which they are by no means unskilled upon the whole the women of this country are very engaging and rendered more so by their free easy and unrestrained manner both sexes are extremely fond of suffering their hair which is black to grow to a prodigious length the ladies wear it plaited and tied up in a kind of club or large lump a mode of hairdressing that does not seem to correspond with their delicate and feminine appearance custom however reconciles us to the most outre fashions and what we thought unbecoming the portugueze considered as highly ornamental i was one day at a gentlemans house to whom i expressed my wonder at the prodigious quantity of hair worn by the ladies adding that i did not conceive it possible for it to be all of their own growth the gentleman assured me that it was and in order to convince me that it was so he called his wife and untied her hair which notwithstanding it was in plaits dragged at least two inches upon the floor as she walked along i offered my service to tie it up again which was politely accepted and considered as a compliment by both it has been said that the portugueze are a jealous people a disposition i never could perceive among any of those with whom i had the pleasure of forming an acquaintance on the contrary they seemed sensible of and pleased with every kind of attention paid to their wives or daughters  the current coin here is the same as that in portugal but silver as well as gold is coined at this place where they have an established mint the pieces of gold are of various sizes and have marked on them the number of thousand rees they are worth the most common coin is a  000 ree piece which passes for l     though not so heavy as an english guinea the silver pieces called petacks value two shillings are also marked with the number of rees they are worth you get ten of these in exchange for a guinea and for a spanish dollar two petacks five vintins and a half which is about four shillings and eightpence here as in portugal they have five ten and twenty thousand ree pieces a ree is a nominal coin twenty make a vintin value about three halfpence eight vintins make one shilling a petack is worth two shillings and of these there are some double pieces value four shillings sterling  one morning as i attended mr il de fonso surgeon general to the army and a man of ingenuity and abilities in his profession to a large public hospital a soldier was brought in with a wound in his left side the instrument had penetrated the abdomen without injuring the intestines and from its form and nature the wound must have been inflicted with the point of a knife or a stiletto the patient after being dressed acquainted us that the preceding night he had had some words with another man about a woman who notwithstanding blows had not passed stabbed him with some sharp instrument of what kind he could not see as it was then dark and afterward made his escape this account led me to believe that assassinations were not unfrequent in brazil but mr il de fonso assured me to the contrary telling me that such instances seldom happened except among the negroes whose vindictive and treacherous dispositions led them wonderful lengths to gratify their revenge whenever night and a convenient opportunity conspired at once to aid and to conceal their horrid acts  while we remained here the weather being cool and favorable i prevailed on the surgeon who was about to amputate a limb to allow me to take it off according to allensons method during the operation i could plainly see that he and his pupils did not seem much pleased with it and he afterward told me it was impossible it could ever answer a very short space of time however made them of a different opinion and in eighteen days after when we sailed i had the satisfaction to leave the patient with his stump nearly cicatrized to the no small joy of the surgeon who said that if the man had died he should have been heavily censured for making him the subject of experiments the circumstance of a mans leg being cut off and almost healed in as many days as it generally takes weeks soon became known and added very much to the estimation in which the people of this place held english surgeons whenever i visited the hospital afterward the objects of pity with which it was filled used to crowd around me in such a manner and in such numbers for my advice that i found it difficult to get from them and they now would readily have submitted to any operation i should have proposed but as i saw the surgeon did not much approve of my interference i gave up all ideas of it  the harbor of rio de janeiro lies in       south latitude and       west longitude about eighteen or twenty leagues to the westward of cape frio the entrance is good and cannot be mistaken on account of a remarkable hill resembling a sugar loaf that is on the left hand side and some islands before it one of which is oblong and does not at some distance look unlike a thatched house they lie from the mouth of the harbor s by w about two leagues ships going in may run on either side the bar over which we carried seven fathom water is not more than threefourths of a mile across and well defended by forts the strongest is called santa cruz built on a rock on the starboard side as you run in from which every shot fired at ships passing must take effect the other named fort lozia is smaller and built on an island or rock on the larboard side a little higher up and lying contiguous to the main land the tide in the harbor rarely ebbs and flows more than seven feet however ships if possible never anchor in this narrow pass between the forts as the bottom is foul and the tide runs with considerable rapidity all danger in going in or running out may be avoided by keeping the mid channel or a little bordering on the starboard shore after santa cruz fort is passed the course is nearly n by w and n n w but as i before observed the eye is the best pilot when you get within a mile of a strong fortified island which lies before the town only separated by a narrow pass called the isle of cobras you are then in the great road where we anchored in fifteen fathom water or should you have occasion to get nearer the town you may run round this island on the north side and anchor above it before the convent of benedictine friars at the n w end of the city before spoken of  the city and harbor are strongly defended and fortified but with very little judgment or regularity the hills are very high and so is the coast which has such strange romantic and almost inaccessible terminations that nature of her own accord without the aid of military skill seems disposed to defend them taking every thing into the account i think it one of the best harbors i have ever seen and upon the whole better calculated to supply the wants of people who have long been at sea and stand in need of refreshment than any part of the world every thing being so remarkably cheap beef may be purchased at seven farthings per pound hogs turkeys and ducks both english and muscovy were equally reasonable fowls were dearer but still sold at a lower rate than in england fish was not very plentiful but i was told that at other seasons they have a most excellent market for that article their market for vegetables however abounded with fruit roots and garden stuff of every kind notwithstanding it was not the best season for fruit it then being too early in the spring to expect abundance oranges which we had in the greatest plenty cost only fivepence the hundred  on a hill about half a mile s e of the city stands a convent named convento de santa theresa the nuns of which amounting to about forty are not allowed to unveil when they come to the grate and on a plain between this convent and the city stands another called convento a de juda a very large building governed by an abbess and several nuns all under the direction of a bishop here about seventy young ladies are placed to be educated who are subject to all the restrictions of a monastic life only they are permitted to be frequently at the grate and that unveiled but what is singular the nuns of this convent when they arrive at a proper age are allowed either to take a husband or to take the veil just as their inclination leads they are not however suffered to quit the convent on any other terms than that of marriage to which the consent and approbation of the bishop is always necessary if they do not get a husband early in life it is common for them to take the veil many of these young ladies were very agreeable both in person and disposition and by frequently conversing with them at the grate we formed as tender an intercourse with them as the bolts and bars between us would admit of myself and two other gentlemen belonging to the fleet singled out three of those who appeared to be the most free and lively to whom we attached ourselves during our stay making them such presents as we thought would prove most acceptable and receiving more valuable ones in return these little attentions were viewed by them in so favorable a light that when we took a last farewell they gave us many evident proofs of their concern and regret indeed every circumstance while we continued at this charming place except there being no inns or coffeehouses where a stranger could refresh himself or be accommodated when he chose to stay a night or two on shore conspired to make us pleased and delighted with it and i can truly say that i left it with reluctance which i believe was the case with many of my companions  september  d the commodore sent mr moreton the master of the sirius and two of his midshipmen who had been put on the invalid list aboard an english ship returning from the southern whale fishery to england which being leaky had been forced into rio as this ship was to sail in a few days it furnished us with an opportunity of writing to our friends about two in the afternoon the commodore made the signal for all officers to repair on board their respective ships and for the transports to hoist in their boats   th at six the fleet weighed with a light land breeze on the commodores approaching santa cruz fort he was saluted from the batteries with twentyone guns which he returned from the sirius with an equal number about ten oclock we got clear of the land steering to the eastward with a gentle breeze thomas brown a convict was punished with a dozen lashes

bay at the cape of good hope in seventeen fathom water abreast of cape town distant about a mile or a mile and half as soon as the sirius anchored the commodore and commissary went on shore and took up their residence in lodgings at the house of mrs de wit they were soon followed by such officers as could be spared from the duty of the fleet all wishing to prepare themselves by the comforts and refreshments to be enjoyed on shore for the last and longest stage of their voyage    th the contract for provisions being settled with messrs de wits and caston the troops men women and children were served with a pound and half of soft bread and an equal quantity of beef or mutton daily and with wine in lieu of spirits the convicts men women and children had the same allowance as the troops except wine    th commodore phillip attended by most of the officers of the fleet paid a complimentary visit to his excellency mynheer van graaf the dutch governor by whom we were received with extreme civility and politeness a few hours after we had taken leave he called on the commodore at his lodgings to return his visit and the next day returned the visit of such officers residing on shore as had paid their respects to him  notwithstanding this studied politeness several days elapsed before the commodore could obtain a categorical answer to the requisition he had made for the supplies he stood in need of for the expedition and had it not been for the judicious perseverance commodore phillip observed in urging his particular situation and the uncommon exigency of the service he was engaged in it was believed the governor fiscal and council would have sheltered their refusal under the pretense that a great scarcity had prevailed in the cape colony the preceding season particularly of wheat and corn which were the articles we stood most in want of this idea they wished to impress us with but as just observed the commodores sagacity and industrious zeal for the service subdued and got over the supineness shown by the governor etc and procured permission for the contractor to supply us with as much stock corn and other necessaries as we could stow it is however much to be lamented that the quantity we could find room for fell very short of what we ought to have taken in as the only spare room we had was what had been occasioned by the consumption of provisions etc since we left rio de janeiro and the removal of twenty female convicts from the friendship into the charlotte the lady penrhyn and the prince of wales  after the supplies had been granted his excellency governor graaf invited the commodore and many of the officers of the expedition to a very handsome dinner at his town residence the house at which we were entertained is delightfully situated nearly in the center of an extensive garden the property of the dutch east india company usefully planted and at the same time elegantly laid out the governors family make what use they please of the produce of the garden which is various and abundant but the original intention of the company in appropriating so extensive a piece of ground to this purpose was that their hospital which is generally pretty full when their ships arrive after long voyages may be well supplied with fruits and vegetables and likewise that their ships may receive a similar supply  this garden is as public as st jamess park and for its handsome pleasant and wellshaded walks is much frequented by persons of every description but particularly by the fashionable and gay there are many other agreeable walks about cape town but none to be compared with these at the upper end of the principal of them is a small space walled in for the purpose of confining some large ostriches and a few deer a little to the right of this is a small menagery in which the company have half a dozen wild animals and about the same number of curious birds  as you approach the cape of good hope a very remarkable mountain may in clear weather be discovered at a considerable distance it is called the table land from its flat surface which resembles that piece of furniture mr dawes lieutenant of marines on board the sirius an ingenious and accurate observer who has undertaken during the voyage the astronomical observations accompanied by messrs fowell and waterhouse midshipmen of the sirius lieutenant de wit of the dutch navy and myself went to the top of this mountain an undertaking which we found to be of a far more serious nature than we at first were aware of for my own part i suffered so much from heat and thirst that had not the fear of shame urged me on my companions being determined to accomplish it at all events i should most certainly have given it up before i reached the top during this sultry and fatiguing expedition i found great benefit toward alleviating my thirst by keeping a small pebble in my mouth and sometimes by chewing rushes which we met with in our way but when we had reached the summit the delightful and extensive prospect we there enjoyed the weather being uncommonly fine fully atoned for the trouble fatigue and every suffering we had undergone from this elevation we could overlook all the country about the cape  as soon as we got to the top our first business was to look out for water but all we could find was some stagnant rain which lay in the hollow of the stones our thirst however was so intolerable that the discovery even of this gave us inexpressible pleasure and notwithstanding we all perspired most violently and were sensible of the danger and impropriety of drinking a quantity of bad water in such a situation yet we could not refrain as for my own part it was utterly out of my power to listen at that time to the dictates of prudence and i believe it was equally difficult to my companions if i might judge from the avidity with which they drank out of the little pools lying on the ground at full length that being the only posture in which it was to be obtained  the regularity of the streets of the town which intersect each other at right angles the buildings gardens castle and forts with twentythree ships then at anchor in the bay all which appeared directly underneath us was a sight beautiful and pleasing beyond description the perpendicular height of this land is      feet from the surface of the water on the top of it we gathered several species of heath some wild celery a few shrubs and some nondescript plants we found also some little stones of a fine polish and singular whiteness  in our descent which proved nearly as difficult and troublesome as going up we saw some runaway negroes round a fire on the clift of a stupendous rock where it was entirely out of the power of their owners to get at them to look at their situation one would think it beyond the utmost stretch of human ingenuity to devise a way to reach it here they remain all day in perfect security and during the night make frequent excursions to the town and the parts adjacent committing great depredations on the inhabitants the whole subsistence of these fugitives depends on this precarious method and even this method would prove insufficient were it not for the assistance they receive from those who were once their fellow slaves nor is it always that they succeed in the depredatory trips which necessity thus urges them to take they are often betrayed by their quondam friends and when this happens as the dutch are not famed for their lenity in punishing crimes they are made horrid examples of but neither the fear of punishment nor hunger thirst cold and wretchedness to which they are often unavailably exposed can deter them from making table land their place of refuge from what they consider to be greater evils scarcely a day passes but a smoke may be seen from some of these inaccessible retreats  in the mild or summer season which commences in september and continues till march the table land is sometimes suddenly capped with a white cloud by some called the spreading of the tablecloth when this cloud seems to roll down the steep face of the mountain it is an unerring indication of an approaching gale of wind from the southeast which generally blows with great violence and sometimes continues a day or more but in common is of short duration on the first appearance of this cloud the ships in table bay begin to prepare for it by striking yards and topmasts and making every thing as snug as possible  a little to the westward of the table land divided by a small valley stands on the right hand side of table bay a round hill called the sugar loaf and by many the lions head as there is a continuance from it contiguous to the sea called the lions rump and when you take a general view of the whole it very much resembles that animal with his head erect the sugar loaf or lions head and the lions rump have each a flagstaff on them by which the approach of ships is made known to the governor particularizing their number nation and the quarter from which they come to the eastward separated by a small chasm from the table land stands charless mount well known by the appellation of the devils tower and so called from the violent gusts of wind supposed to issue from it when it partakes of the cap that covers the table land though these gusts are nothing more than a degree of force the wind acquires in coming through the chasm when this phenomenon appears in the morning which is by no means so frequent as in the evening the sailors have a saying as the devils tower is almost contiguous to the table land that the old gentleman is going to breakfast if in the middle of the day that he is going to dinner and if in the evening that the cloth is spread for supper  the foregoing high lands form a kind of amphitheatre about the table valley where the cape town stands from the shipping the town appears pleasantly situated but at the same time small a deception that arises from its being built in a valley with such stupendous mountains directly behind it on landing however you are surprised and agreeably disappointed to find it not only extensive but well built and in a good style the streets spacious and intersecting each other at right angles with great precision this exactness in the formation of the streets when viewed from the table land is observed to be very great the houses in general are built of stone cemented together with a glutinous kind of earth which serves as mortar and afterward neatly plastered and whitewashed with lime as to their height they do not in common exceed two stories on account of the violence of the wind which at some seasons of the year blows with great strength and fury indeed sometimes so violently as to shake the houses to the very foundation for the same reason thatch has been usually preferred to tiles or shingles but the bad effects that have proceeded from this mode when fires happen has induced the inhabitants in all their new buildings to give the preference to slates and tiles the lower parts of the houses according to the custom of the dutch nation are not only uncommonly neat and clean in appearance but they are really so and the furniture is rather rich than elegant but this is by no means the case with the bedrooms or upper apartments which are more barely and worse furnished than any i ever beheld and the streets seem to be much upon a par with them they being rough uneven and unpaved i was however upon the whole extremely well pleased with the town many of the houses have a space flagged before the door and others have trees planted before them which form a pleasant shade and give pleasing novelty to the streets  the only landingplace is at the east end of the town where there is a wooden quay running some paces into the sea with several cranes on it for the convenience of loading and unloading the scoots that come along side to this place excellent water is conveyed by pipes which makes the watering of ships both easy and expeditious  close to this quay on the left hand stands the castle and principal fortress a strong extensive work having excellent accommodations for the troops and for many of the civil officers belonging to the company within the gates the company have their principal stores which are spacious as well as convenient this fort covers and defends the east part of the town and harbor as amsterdam fort does the west part the latter which has been built since commodore johnstones expedition and whereon both french and dutch judgment have been united to render it effectual and strong is admirably planned and calculated to annoy and harass ships coming into the bay some smaller detached fortifications extend along the coast both to the east and west and make landing which was not the case before the late war hazardous and difficult in a word cape town is at this time fortified with strength regularity and judgment  there are two churches here one large plain and unadorned for the calvinists the prevailing sect and a smaller one for the lutherans  the hospital which is large and extensive is situated at the upper end of the town close to the companys garden it is an honor to that commercial body and no small ornament to the town the only objection that can be made to it as a building is its situation had it been erected on an eminence and a little detached from the town which might easily have been done no fault could have been found with it as it is the convalescents have free access to the companys gardens where they reap the benefit of a wholesome pure air perfumed with the exhalations of a great variety of rich fruit trees aromatic shrubs and odorous plants and flowers and likewise have the use of every production of it as before observed advantages that compensate in a great measure for the flat situation of the hospital  the inhabitants are all exceedingly fond of gardens which they keep in most excellent order the doing this is very little trouble to them the climate and soil being most benign and friendly to vegetation among the many which afforded me delight i must not forget that belonging to coloned gordon commander in chief of the dutch troops at the cape where not only the taste and ingenuity of the gardener but the skill and knowledge of the botanist are at once manifest the colonel is a man of science of an active and wellcultivated genius and who appropriates those hours he can spare from his military duties in which he is said to excel to a perusal of the book of nature and researches after useful knowledge these pursuits tend not only to this amusement but to his honor and they will doubtless at some time or other further conduce to the advancement of natural history and to the honor of his country as it is said he intends to publish the observations and remarks which have been the result of his researches those he has made on the hottentots caffres and the countries they inhabit will doubtlessly be valuable he having made himself better acquainted with the subject and penetrated farther into the interior parts than any traveller or naturalist that has hitherto visited the cape it is to be lamented that he has so long withheld from the world the gratification and improvement which most assuredly must be derived from the observations of a person so well and so extensively informed his polite attention and civility during our stay at the cape claim our most grateful acknowledgments  besides their hospital the dutch east india company have several other public buildings which tend to improve the appearance of the town the two principal of these are the stables and a house for their slaves the former is a handsome range of buildings capable of containing an incredible number of horses those they have at the cape are small spirited and full of life the latter is a building of considerable extent where the slaves both male and female have separate apartments in a very comfortable style to reside in after the fatigues and toil of the day which undoubtedly is great but by no means equal in my opinion to that endured by the slaves in our own colonies however severe and cruel the dutch may be considered in other respects they certainly treat their slaves with great humanity and kindness which i am sorry to say i scarcely ever saw done in the west indies during a residence there of three years on the contrary i have frequently been witness to the infliction of the most brutal cruel and wanton punishments on these poor creatures who are the source and immediate support of the splendor of the creoles the bare retrospect of the cruelties i have seen exercised there excites a kind of horror that chills my blood at the cape there are several officers placed over the slaves who have commodious apartments and treat them humanely  the first week after our arrival at this place the militia consisting both of horse and foot were embodied and held their annual meeting i say annual as that is the usual period but this was the first time of their assembling since the conclusion of the war in      the cape militia differ from the english in not receiving pay or wearing regimentals in fact they should rather be called volunteers who turn out for the protection of their own property and are not subject to strict military discipline most of them wore blue coats with white metal buttons aukwardly long and in the cut and shape of which uniformity had not been attended to neither was it visible in the other parts of their dress or accoutrements some wore powder others none so that upon the whole they made a very unmilitary appearance the officers are chosen annually from among themselves some of these indeed i observed to be very well dressed neglect nonattendance and every other breach of their military rules is punished by fine or forfeiture and not corporally at this burlesque on the profession of a soldier i could not help observing that many of them had either got intoxicated that morning or were not recovered from their overnights debauch notwithstanding which they marched to the field and went through their evolutions with a steadiness and regularity that was really astonishing considering the state they were in but it is said and i believe with some truth that a dutchman when half drunk is more capable of performing every kind of business than if he were perfectly sober after these annual exhibitions the members of the corpse meet their wives daughters etc who take care to be present that they may be witnesses of their military skill and achievements at some friends house where they crown the night in dancing of which they are uncommonly fond to dancing are added substantial suppers and potent libations in which they indulge not only upon this but on all other occasions a dutch supper to me at first was a matter of wonder as i could never see any kind of difference either in the quality or quantity between them and their dinners which were always abundant and consisting chiefly of heavy food  the inhabitants of the cape though in their persons large slout and athletic have not all that phlegm about them which is the characteristic of dutchmen in general the physical influence of climate may in some degree account for this for it is well known that in all southern latitudes the temper and disposition of the people are more gay and that they are more inclined to luxury and amusements of every kind than the inhabitants of the northern hemisphere  the ladies at the cape are lively good natured familiar and gay they resemble the women of england more than any foreigners i have ever seen english fashions prevail among them the female part of the governors family excepted who imitate the french notwithstanding their intercourse with france is now by far greater than with england the habits and customs of the women of this place are extremely contrasted to those of the inhabitants of rio de janeiro among the latter a great deal of reserve and modesty is apparent between the sexes in public those who are disposed to say tender and civil things to a lady must do it by stealth or breathe their soft sighs through the latticework of a window or the grates of a convent but at the cape if you wish to be a favorite with the fair as the custom is you must in your own defense if i may use the expression grapple the lady and paw her in a manner that does not partake in the least of gentleness such a rough and uncouth conduct together with a kiss ravished now and then in the most public manner and situations is not only pleasing to the fair one but even to her parents if present and is considered by all parties as an act of the greatest gallantry and gaiety in fact the dutch ladies here from a peculiar gay turn admit of liberties that may be thought reprehensible in england but perhaps as seldom overstep the bounds of virtue as the women of other countries  during my residence on shore whenever i heard of any hottentots being in town i made a point of endeavoring to get a sight of them in order to see whether their manners and appearance corresponded with the description given of them by travelers such as being besmeared with grease and decorated with the stinking entrails of animals on which they likewise when pressed by hunger are said to feed  i saw many of the men without being able to make any other remarks on them than that they were thin of rather a low stature but formed for activity and further that their hair which was short and woolly as well as their whole bodies was bedaubed with some unctuous or greasy substance which was very offensive they were of a dark brown color had a flat nose thick lips large full eyes and were ornamented with ivory rings and wore narrow strips of the skin of some animal devoid of its hair around their neck legs and arms the only female of that nation i could get a sight of was during a little excursion in the environs of cape town walking one evening with a dutch getleman to see a garden about a mile from the town i accidentally met one of these ladies who was equally as offensive as the male i had met  the heavy draft work about the cape is mostly performed by oxen which are here brought to an uncommon degree of usefulness and docility it is not uncommon to see fourteen sixteen and sometimes eighteen in one of their teams when the roads are heavy they sometimes though rarely yoke twenty all which the hottentots malayes and cape slaves have in the most perfect subjection and obedience one of these fellows places himself on the fore part of the wagon or when loaded on the top of the load and with a tremendous long whip which from its size he is obliged to hold in both his hands manages these creatures with inexpressible address i have often seen the driver when he has found expedition needful make them keep whatever pace he thought proper either trot or gallop a gait performed or kept up with difficulty by european oxen and that with as much ease as if he was driving horses this immense whip the only thing with which they guide the team the drivers use so dexterously that they make them turn a corner with the utmost nicety hitting even the leading pair in whatever part they please the blows thus given must inflict intolerable pain or these slow animals could never be brought to go with the velocity they do at the cape these sooty charioteers likewise manage horses with the same dexterity to see one of them driving three four five and sometimes six pair in hand with one of these long whips as i have often done with great surprise would make the most complete master of the whip in england cut a despicable figure carriages are not very numerous at the cape as the inhabitants in general travel in covered wagons which better suit the roughness of the country the governor and some few of the principal people keep coaches which are a good deal in the english style and always drawn by six horses the only chariot  november   th having got on board such animals provisions etc as we could stow the commodore with all the officers that had lodgings on shore embarked previous to the commodores embarkation he gave a public dinner to some of the gentlemen of the town and the officers of his fleet the dutch governor was to have been of the party but by some unforeseen event was detained in the country where he had been for some days before commodore phillip had his band of music on shore upon the occasion and the day was spent with great cheerfulness and conviviality    th about half past one oclock we sailed from the cape of good hope a small american ship had arrived during the forenoon bound on a trading voyage to china with several passengers on board we learnt from her that the hartwell east indiaman had been lost by bordering too close on the island of bonavista in order to land some recruits who had mutinied and occasioned great disorder and confusion in the ship it gave us pleasure to hear from the carpenter of the hartwell who was on board the american ship that no lives were lost by the accident the principal part of the crew we found had got to madeira on their return to england abreast of penguin island about three oclock we passed a large dutch ship from holland bound to the cape with troops on board a little before it was dark we spoke the kent whaler from london who had been four months out she with ourselves was endeavoring to get to the eastward on our first discovering her as she seemed desirous of joining or speaking to the fleet we were in hopes of her being from england probably to us or at least that we might get letters by her but our suspense on these points a suspense only to be conceived by persons on long voyages was soon put an end to by hearing she had been so many months out a few days before we left the cape some of the officers of the expedition received letters from england by the ranger east india packet captain buchanan who had put in to water and stop a leak both of which being soon accomplished she proceeded on her voyage    th this morning catherine pryor one of the convicts was delivered of a male child the officers seamen troops and convicts were put to an allowance of three quarts of water a day    th the wind variable inclining to the southward and eastward with hazy weather an epidemic dysentry appeared among the convicts which very soon made its way among the marines and prevailed with violence and obstinacy until about christmas when it was got under by an unremitting attention to cleanliness and every other method proper and essential for the removal and prevention of contagion it gives me pleasure to be able to add that we only lost one person by this disease violent and dangerous as it was and that was daniel cresswell one of the troops intended for the garrison who was seized on the   th of november and died the  0th of the same month the eleventh day of his illness from the commencement of his disorder he was in the most acute agonizing pain i ever was witness to nor was it in the power of medicine to procure him the shortest interval of ease his case being a very singular one i have transmitted it with some others to a medical friend in london with permission to make what use of them he may think proper the wind kept to the southward and eastward until the   st without veering a point in our favor which carried us far out of our way to the westward but that day it shifted    d we spoke the prince of wales who informed us that the preceding night one of the seamen had fallen from the topsail yard and was drowned indeed it was so dark and the ship went so fast through the water that all efforts to save him had any been made would have proved fruitless this day and the following running to eastward with the wind to the southward and westward we saw many aquatic birds    th the commodore removed into the supply armed tender and took with him lieutenant king of the sirius and mr dawes of the marines whom i had before occasion to mention as having undertaken the astronomical observations during the voyage having likewise selected some artificers from among the convicts he went on taking the alexander scarborough and friendship with him being fast sailing vessels leaving the heavy sailers both transports and victuallers under the direction of captain hunter of the sirius major ross commanding officer of the troops removed into the scarborough as did the adjutant  flying squadron as the seamen termed them the wind continued all this day at e s e with pleasant clear weather    th the wind shifted to the e n e the weather hazy

officer   th in the morning almost calm with a heavy swell in the evening a small breeze sprung up at the n e which next day shifted to the westward    th in lat      south long       east clear

0th wind variable inclining to the south i visited the prince of wales where i found some of the female convicts with evident symptoms of the scurvy brought on by the damp and cold weather we had lately experienced the two succeeding days the wind to the westward though at times variable with dark wet gloomy weather in lat       south long  0   east we saw and passed some sea weed on those days the scurvy began to show itself in the charlotte mostly among those who had the dysentery to a violent degree but i was pretty well able to keep it under by a liberal use of the essence of malt and some good wine which ought not to be classed among the    th the weather still dark and gloomy had several birds round the ship of the albatross and peteral kind with what appeared to me to be something of the seahawk species    th dark hazy weather with some light squalls we passed more sea weed some gulls and many of the beforementioned birds about the ship   0th and   st strong breezes with unsettledlooking weather birds still about us and likewise some whales  january  st      the new year was introduced with a pretty heavy gale of wind from the northward and westward which was the first we had encountered since we left england it began a little before    oclock the preceding night and continued till seven this evening the sirius was the whole day under her staysails and the convoy under their foresail and staysails   d and  d smart gales with dark gloomy weather some seals and oceanic birds about the ship   th cloudy weather in latitude      s the sirius made the signal for the longitude by lunar observation which was found to be      0 east in the evening some birds called mother carys chickens were round the ship   th the weather cold and clear the wind n w passed some sea weed in the morning the third mate thought he saw some diverse but as they were not seen by any other person not much attention was paid to the report at night we had some squalls with light showers of rain   th early in the morning the lady penrhyn made the signal for seeing land but it only proved to be a fogbank a circumstance that often deceives the anxious mariner about two oclock in the afternoon the prince of wales being the headmost ship made the same signal the charlotte being next in succession the signal was scarcely displayed before we also discovered it very plainly through the haze and repeated the signal which was answered by the sirius by our last lunar observation this land appears to be well laid down in maskelynes tables and in the journals of the celebrated cook but to the surprise of every one on board we found a small chart published by steel and which was held in little estimation to be not only accurate as to the situation but also to give a tolerable appearance and description of van diernans land indeed such as may prove extremely useful to ships coming this way and fully sufficient to enable them to avoid all danger if the weather be clear for my own part i see no hazard that attends making this land by day such an attempt by night would be very incautious and absurd as nature has been very particular in pointing out where it lies by rocks which jutt out of the sea like so many beacons i believe a convoy was never conducted with more care or made the land with greater accuracy and certainty than this indeed ability and experienced nautical knowledge were never more fully evinced on all occasions than by captain hunter who i may venture to pronounce without much risk of having my veracity called in question one of the most assiduous and accurate observers and able navigators the present day furnishes his appointment to this expedition by lord how is strongly marked with that prudence and wisdom which are known to govern his lordships conduct captian hunter has a pretty turn for drawing which will enable him no doubt to give such a description of this coast as will do credit to himself and be of singular advantage as well to those whose lot it may to visit hereafter this extensive coast as to navigation at large the assistance of lieutenant bradley first of the sirius who likewise is an officer of more than common abilities as a navigator in conducting a convoy in a track so little known must have been pleasing to captain hunter  as we run in with the land which is pretty high we were surprised to see at this season of the year some small patches of snow the haze being dispersed by a gentle breeze at n n w we could observe and hear as we were not more than six or seven miles from the shore the surf beating high and loudly against some uneven rocks which jutted out in strange projections into the sea this part of the coast as far as we could see is bold irregular and craggy and very few trees or appearance of verdure to be seen at four in the afternoon being about six or eight miles to the eastward of the eastwardmost rock called the mewstone there being several others which we distinctly saw bearing n n w we discovered to the westward of them some eminences which probably might be islands or if not some land running a considerable way into the sea for my own part i am inclined to believe the latter to be the case though the distance was too great to hazard a conclusive opinion upon it as a large smoke was seen close to the innermost height  about seven steering to the eastward along shore nearly at the distance of four miles being well in with the westwardmost point of a very large bay called storm bay laid down in lat      s and long     e we discovered swilly bearing s e s and a little to the eastward of it a small rock rising out of the sea distinguished by the name of the eddystone from its resemblance to the eddystone lighthouse off plymouth which was very perceptible at the distance we were then from it our being close in with the land prevented us from seeing either of these before as they lie at least six or seven leagues out to sea from the s w cape which lies in lat       s and long      0 e to the s e cape which is admitted to be tasmans south cape is about the distance of fifteen or sixteen leagues as we got to the eastward we saw many trees mostly of a dwarf or stunted kind with a whitish bark and perfectly leafless this part of the country still continued to be a rough rugged uneven tract with very little appearance of fertility some small patches of verdure were discovered about storm bay and the trees seemed to increase in number and size between eight and nine at night we saw a large fire on the east point of land which forms this bay made by the natives none of whom could we see during the day though close in with the shore nor did we perceive any other indication of its being inhabited but this fire and the smoke mentioned to be seen on our first falling in with the land the distance between the smoke and the fire was eight leagues a space that would surely have exhibited some other proofs of populosity had it been thickly peopled  about  0 oclock off storm bay the weather moderately pleasant the ship was taken aback the lady penrhyn was then under our lee quarter which obliged us to tack after which we immediately wore brought the ship to the wind on the other tack and stood to sea with the rest of the ships the wind was then at n e which just enabled us to weather swilly and the eddystone as we got to sea the wind increased moderately   th the wind and weather variable could perceive nothing of the land i went on board the fishburne to see the boatswain who on the first night of the new year having probably drank more grog than he ought and the ship laboring much had fallen from the topsail yard by which he bruised himself in a dreadful manner the man being highly scorbutic the parts soon mortified and he died about half an hour after i got on board the master of the ship showed evident marks of great concern for this invaluable man as he termed him he declared to me that sooner than venture again on so long a voyage without a surgeon he would put to sea with less than half his complement of men for he was strongly of opinion that if the poor fellow had received immediate assistance he would have recovered i should have seen him sooner but was prevented by my own indifferent state of health how owners of ships can think of sending them through such a variety of climates and a voyage of so great a length without a surgeon is to me a matter of surprise the lady penrhyn owned by alderman curtis was the only merchant ship in our fleet that had a surgeon what the others will do on their return heaven only knows but this i well know that they would never have reached thus far but for the succor given them by myself and my assistants   th wind variable and weather hazy damp and dark with some vivid flashes of lightning succeeded by distant peals of loud thunder on the morning of this day died edward thomson a convict worn out with a melancholy and long confinement had he lived i think he would have proved a deserving member of society as he seemed sensible of the impropriety and imprudence of his former life and studious to atone for it   0th the wind variable and weather dark and gloomy with a very troublesome high sea about two oclock p m we had one of the most sudden gusts of wind i ever remember to have known in an instant it split our mainsail and but for the activity shown by the sailors in letting fly the sheets and lowering the topsails the masts must have gone over the side the prince of wales who was close to us had her main yard carried away in the slings fortunately for us the squall was of short duration otherwise the ships must have suffered considerably from the uncommon cross sea that was running which we had found to be the case ever since we reached this coast    th and   th the wind variable inclining to the southward and westward and still an unpleasant cross troublesome sea we saw a whale several seals and many large oceanous birds which we frequently fired at without their betraying the smallest symptom of fear either at the report or at the balls which frequently dropped close to them a conclusion may be drawn from hence that they had never been harassed with fire arms before if they had they would undoubtedly have shown some fear a sensation they seemed to be totally unacquainted with in all our firings we did not kill one of them    th in the evening we saw the land over red point bearing w by n the extremes of the land from s s w to n we were then about three leagues from the shore and finding it unlikely to get in that night captain hunter made the signal for the convoy to come within hail when he acquainted them that the entrance into botany bay bore n n w adding that for the night he intended to stand off and on and early in the morning make sail for the bay   0th at four in the morning the sirius and convoy made sail and at eight oclock anchored in eight fathom water cape banks e s e point solander s s e and the entrance of the bay between these two lands w s w we found here the supply tender which had arrived the   th and the alexander scarborough and friendship transports who had only arrived the day before to fee all the ships safe in their destined port without ever having by any accident been one hour separated and all the people in as good health as could be expected or hoped for after so long a voyage was a sight truly pleasing and at which every heart must rejoice as we sailed into the bay some of the natives were on the shore looking with seeming attention at such large moving bodies coming amongst them in the evening the boats were permitted to land on the north side in order to get water and grass for the little stock we had remaining an officers guard was placed there to prevent the seamen from straggling or having any improper intercourse with the natives captain hunter after anchoring waited on the governor on board the supply who with several other officers landed as they rowed along the shore some of the natives followed the boat but on her putting in for the snore they ran into the woods some of the gentlemen however before they returned on board obtained an interview with them during which they showed some distrust but upon the whole were civilly inclined the boats sent to haul the seine returned having had tolerable success the fish they caught were bream mullet large rays besides many other smaller species    st the governor captain hunter and the two masters of the men of war with a party of marines set off this morning in two rigged long boats to examine port jackson a harbor lying a little to the northward which was discovered by captain cook    d the party returned this evening full of praises on the extent and excellence of the harbor as well as the superiority of the ground water and situation to that of botany bay which i own does not in my opinion by any means merit the commendations bestowed on it by the muchlamented cook and others whose names and judgments are no less admired and esteemed during his excellencys absence the lieutenant governor had issued his orders to land all the artificers that could be found among the convicts and a party of others to clear the ground for the intended town to dig sawpits and to perform every thing that was essential toward the works purposed to be carried on although the spot fixed on for the town was the most eligible that could be chosen yet i think it would never have answered the ground around it being sandy poor and swampy and but very indifferently supplied with water the fine meadows talked of in captain cooks voyage i could never see though i took some pains to find them out nor have i ever heard of a person that has seen any parts resembling them while the people were employed on shore the natives came several times among them and behaved with a kind of cautious friendship one evening while the seine was hauling some of them were present and expressed great surprise at what they saw giving a shout expressive of astonishment and joy when they perceived the quantity that was caught no sooner were the fish out of the water than they began to lay hold of them as if they had a right to them or that they were their own upon which the officer of the boat i think very properly restrained them giving however to each of them a part they did not at first seem very well pleased with this mode of procedure but on observing with what justice the fish was distributed they appeared content  while we remained at botany bay as i was one morning on board the supply we saw twentynine of the natives on the beach looking toward the shipping upon which lieutenants ball and king mr dawes and myself went on shore landing at the place where they were they were friendly and pacific though each of them was armed with a spear or long dart and had a stick with a shell at the end used by them in throwing their weapons besides these some few had shields made of the bark of the cork tree of a plain appearance but sufficient to ward off or turn their own weapons some of which were pointed and barbed with the bones of fish fastened on with some kind of adhesive gum one of the most friendly and who appeared to be the most confident on signs being made to him stuck the end of his shield in the sand but could not be prevailed upon to throw his spear at it finding he declined it i fired a pistol ball through it the explosion frightened him as well as his companions a little but they soon got over it and on my putting the pistol into my pocket he took up the shield and appeared to be much surprised at finding it perforated he then by signs and gestures seemed to ask if the pistol would make a hole through him and on being made sensible that it would he showed not the smallest signs of fear on the contrary he endeavored as we construed his motions to impress us with an idea of the superiority of his own arms which he applied to his breast and by staggering and a show of falling seemed to wish us to understand that the force and effect of them was mortal and not to be resisted however i am well convinced that they know and dread the superiority of our arms notwithstanding this show of indifference as they on all occasions have discovered a dislike to a musket and so very soon did they make themselves acquainted with the nature of our military dress that from the first they carefully avoided a soldier or any person wearing a red coat which they seem to have marked as a fighting vesture many of their warriors or distinguished men we observed to be painted in stripes across the breast and back which at some little distance appears not unlike our soldiers cross belts    th the boats were employed in getting water and grass for the live stock as the governor finding port jackson more suited to his wishes had determined to remove to that place and form the settlement there while these preparations were making every person in the fleet were surprised to see in this part of the world two large ships plying hard in the offing to get into the bay it was seen in the evening that they had french colors flying but the wind blowing pretty strong out of the bay they were unable to get in and the weather becoming thick and hazy we soon lost sight of them    th nothing of the strange ships to be seen the governor with a detachment of marines sailed in the supply tender for port jackson leaving instructions with captain hunter to follow him with all the transports and victuallers as soon as the wind and weather would permit    th we again descried the french ships standing in for the bay with a leading wind upon which captain hunter sent his first lieutenant on board the commanding officers ship which was distinguished by a broad pendant to assist them in coming in soon after the lieutenants were returned to the sirius captain clonnard the french commodores captain who during the late war commanded the artois taken by the bienfaisant captain macbride waited on captain hunter and informed him that the ships were the astrolabe and the boussale which sailed from france in the year      under the command of messieurs de la perouse and de langle he further acquainted him that having touched at navigators isles they had had the misfortune to lose captain de langle the second in command with ten other officers and two boats crews all of whom were cut off by the natives of those islands who appeared to be numerous and warlike this accident induced them to put into this port in order to build some boats which they had in frames it also had afforded room for the promotion of monsieur clonnard who on their leaving france was only the commodores first lieutenant  at ten oclock the sirius with all the ships weighed and in the evening anchored in port jackson with a few trifling damages done to some of them who had run foul of each other in working out of botany bay port jackson i believe to be without exception the finest and most extensive harbor in the universe and at the same time the most secure being safe from all the winds that blow it is divided into a great number of coves to which his excellency has given different names that on which the town is to be built is called sydney cove it is one of the smallest in the harbor but the most convenient as ships of the greatest burden can with ease go into it and heave out close to the shore trincomale acknowledged to be one of the best harbors in the world is by no means to be compared to it in a word port jackson would afford sufficient and sase anchorage for all the navies of europe the supply had arrived the day before and the governor with every person that could be spared from the ship were on shore clearning the ground for the encampment in the evening when all the ships had anchored the english colors were displayed and at the foot of the flagstaff his majestys health and success to the settlement was drank by the governor many of the principal officers and private men who were present upon the occasion    th a number of convicts from the different transports were landed to assist in clearing the ground for the encampment his excellency marked the outlines and as much as possible to prevent irregularity and to keep the convicts from straggling the provost marshal aided by the patrole had orders to take into custody all convicts that should be found without the lines and to leave them in charge of the main or quarter guard the boats sent this day to fish were successful some of the natives came into the little bay or cove where the seine was hauled and behaved very friendly indeed they carried their civility so far although a people that appeared to be averse to work as to assist in dragging it ashore for this kind office they were liberally rewarded with fish which seemed to please them and give general satisfaction    th a convenient place for the cattle being found the few that remained were landed the frame and materials for the governors house constructed by smith in st georges fields were likewise sent on shore and some preparations made for erecting it this day captain hunter and lieutenant bradley began to take a survey of the harbor in the course of the last week all the marines their wives and children together with all the convicts male and female were landed the laboratory and sick tents were erected and i am sorry to say were soon filled with patients afflicted with the true camp dysentery and the scurvy more pitiable objects were perhaps never seen not a comfort or convenience could be got for them besides the very few we  february  st we had the most tremendous thunder and lightning with heavy rain i ever remember to have seen   d this morning five sheep belonging to the lieutenant governor and quartermaster were killed by the lightning under a tree at the foot of which a shed had been built for them the branches and trunk of the tree were shivered and rent in a very extraordinary manner   th a storehouse has been begun for the purpose of receiving the stores and provisions of the three transports bound to china on a muster of the convicts this morning some were found to be missing and supposed to have gone to botany bay in hopes of being received on board the french ships which are said to be short of hands and made more so by the loss they had recently sustained as before mentioned   th the governors commission and that for establishing a criminal court of judicature admiralty court etc were read after this was done the troops under arms fired three volleys when his excellency thanked the soldiers for their steady and good conduct which major ross caused to be inserted in the general order book the governor then addressed the convicts in a short speech extremely well adapted to the people he had to govern and who were then before him among many circumstances that would tend to their future happiness and comfort he recommended marriage assuring them that an indiscriminate and illegal intercourse would be punished with the greatest severity and rigor honesty obedience and industry he told them would make their situation comfortable whereas a contrary line of conduct would subject them to ignominy severities and punishment when the ceremony was concluded his excellency attended by all the officers of the colony withdrew to a tent pitched for the occasion where a cold dinner was laid out and after the cloth was removed many loyal and public toasts were drank   th a party of the gentlemen of the garrison set out by land to pay a visit to the french at botany bay from whom they met with the most hospitable polite and friendly reception and treatment many of the convicts who had been missing had been at botany bay they had offered themselves to the french navigators on any terms but not one of them had been received this refusal obliged them to return and when they came back they were real objects of pity conscious of the punishment that awaited so imprudent and improper an experiment they had stayed out as long as the cravings of nature would permit and were nearly half starved a woman named ann smith and a man have never since been heard of they are supposed to have missed their way as they returned and to have perished for want as the french commodore had given his honor that he would not admit any of them on board it cannot be thought he would take them the convict it is true was a frenchman named peter paris and it is possible on that account he might have been concealed through pity by his countrymen and carried off without the knowledge of the commanding officer at the very time the party from hence were gone by land to botany bay captain clonnard came round in a boat on a visit of ceremony from monsieur de la peyrouse to the governor he brought with him some dispatches which he requested might be forwarded to the french ambassador at the court of london by the first transports that sailed for england the captain stayed all night and returned the next morning this day for the first time a kangaroo was shot and brought into camp some of the natives passed pretty close to the sirius without seeming to express by their countenance or actions either fear curiosity or surprise during the course of this week fourteen marriages were solemnized the criminal court consisting of six officers of his majestys forces by land or sea with the judge advocate sat for the first time before whom several convicts were tried for petty larceny some of them were acquitted others sentenced to receive corporal punishment and one or two were by the decision of the court ordered to a barren rock or little island in the middle of the harbor there to remain on bread and water for a stated time    th the commissions were read a second time at the desire of some of the officers whose situation with the battalion prevented them from being present at the first reading after which the lieutenant governor and judge advocate were sworn in justices of the peace and lieutenant king second of the sirius superintendant and commanding officer of new norfolk island an appointment given him by the governor    th the supply sailed for norfolk island with lieutenant king and his detachment consisting of mr cunningham masters mate and mr jameson surgeons first mate of the sirius two marines and twelve male and female convicts the governor furnished him with provisions and stores of every kind for six months and with tools for cutting down timber which last employment was the purpose of his mission    th thomas barrett henry lovel and joseph hall were brought before the criminal court and tried for feloniously and fraudulently taking away from the public store beef and pease the property of the crown they were convicted on the clearest evidence and sentence of death being passed on them they were about six oclock the same evening taken to the fatal tree where barrett was launched into eternity after having confessed to the rev mr johnson who attended him that he was guilty of the crime and had long merited the ignominious death which he was about to suffer and to which he said he had been brought by bad company and evil example lovel and hall were respited until six oclock the next evening when that awful hour arrived they were led to the place of execution and just as they were on the point of ascending the ladder the judge advocate arrived with the governors pardon on condition of their being banished to some uninhabited place    th daniel gordon and john williams were tried and convicted of stealing wine the property of mr zachariah clarke williams being an ignorant black youth the court recommended him to the governor as a proper object of mercy and he was accordingly pardoned gordon who was another black had his sentence of death while at the gallows changed to banishment with lovel and hall  cassomary of new south wales depiction of bird   0th john freeman was tried for stealing from another convict seven pounds of flour he was convicted and sentenced to be hanged but while under the ladder with the rope about his neck he was offered his free pardon on condition of performing the duty of the common executioner as long as he remained in this country which after some little pause he reluctantly accepted william sheerman his accomplice was sentenced to receive on his bare back with a catoninetails three hundred lashes which were inflicted  a new holland cassowary was brought into camp this bird stands seven feet high measuring from the ground to the upper part of the head and in every respect is much larger than the common cassowary of all authors and differs so much therefrom in its form as to clearly prove it a new species the color of the plumage is greatly similar consisting of a mixture of dirty brown and gray on the belly it was somewhat whiter and the remarkable structure of the feathers in having two quills with their webs arising out of one shaft is seen in this as well as the common sort it differs materially in wanting the horny appendage on the top of the head the head and beak are much more like those of the ostrich than the common cassowary both in shape and size upon the upper part of the head the feathers with which it is but thinly covered are very small looking more like hair than feathers and in having the neck pretty well clothed with them except the chin and throat which are so thinly covered that the skin which is there of a purplish color may be seen clearly the small wings are exceedingly short which form a ridiculous contrast with the body as they are even less than those of the cassowary they have no large quills in them being only covered with the small feathers that grow all over the body another singularity also presents itself in this species which is in respect to the legs as to the back part of them the whole length is indented or sawed in a remarkable manner the toes are three in number the middle one long the other two short with strong claws not unlike the same part of the common species on examining the viscera they differed from that of every other species of the feathered kind which i had ever seen particularly in having no gizzard or second stomach and the liver was so very small that it did not exceed in size that of a blackbird  this bird is supposed to be not uncommon in new holland as it has been frequently seen by our settlers both at botany bay and port jackson but is exceedingly shy and runs faster than a greyhound one of them however has been shot a drawing was taken from this bird of which an engraving is annexed it has been lately sent to england by the governor as a present to lord sydney who through the medium of sir joseph banks has deposited it in the collections of natural history of mr john hunter in leicester square   march  th the governor with two long boats manned and armed returned from broken bay situated a little to the northward which he had been exploring for several days it affords good shelter for shipping and the entrance is bold it cannot however be compared to port jackson while he was there he saw a great many of the natives some of whom he thinks he had observed before either at botany bay or in the neighborhood of port jackson one of the females happened to fall in love with his great coat and to obtain it she used a variety of means first she danced and played a number of antic tricks but finding this mode ineffectual she had recourse to tears which she shed plentifully this expedient not answering she ceased from weeping and appeared as cheerful as any of the party around her from this little incident it may be seen that they are not a people devoid of art at broken bay many of the females young and old had the first joint of the little finger on their left hand cut off as this was the case with those who were married or appeared to be so from their having young children as well as with those who were too young for a connection of that nature it was not possible to account for the cause of such an amputation thefts and depredations on one another have become so very frequent and glaring among the convicts that scarcely a day passes without some of these miserable delinquents being punished so hardened in wickedness and depravity are many of them that they seem insensible to the fear of corporal punishment or even death itself  the principal business going forward at present is erecting cabbagetree huts for the officers soldiers and convicts some storehouses etc and a very good hospital all which in the completion will cost a great deal of time and trouble as the timber of this country is very unfit for the purpose of building nor do i know any one purpose for which it will answer except for firewood and for that it is excellent but in other respects it is the worst wood that any country or climate ever produced although some of the trees when standing appear fit for any use whatever masts for shipping not excepted strange as it may be imagined no wood in this country though sawed ever so thin and dried ever so well will float repeated trials have only served to convince me that immediately on immersion it sinks to the bottom like a stone  the stone of this country is excellent for building could any kind of cement be found to keep it together there is not any limestone i believe in new south wales the governor notwithstanding that he had collected together all the shells which could be found for the purpose of obtaining from them the lime necessary to the construction of a house for his own residence did not procure even a fourth part of the quantity which was wanted the foundation stone of a private house for him has been laid and a plate of copper with the following inscription engraved on it is to be placed in the wall arthur phillip esquire captain general in and over his majestys territory of new south wales and its dependencies arrived in this country on the   th day of january      with the first settlers and on the   th day of may in the same year the first of these stones was laid  the supply tender returned from norfolk island where with great difficulty and danger the stores sent with lieutenant king were landed on account of the rockyness of its shore and the violence of the surf that almost continually beats upon it in her passage there she fell in with an island in lat       s long       e never before discovered to which lieutenant ball who commanded the supply on this occasion gave the name of lord howes island on her return to this port she stopped at it and found the landing nearly if not quite as difficult as at norfolk island the shore in many places was covered with excellent turtle eighteen of which were brought here and proved a seasonable supply to the convicts afflicted with the scurvy many of whom were in a deplorable situation  the smallest turtle brought from lord howes island did not weigh less than   0lb they also found on it in great plenty a kind of fowl resembling much the guinea fowl in shape and size but widely different in color they being in general all white with a red fleshy substance rising like a cocks comb from the head and not unlike a piece of sealingwax these not being birds of flight nor in the least wild the sailors availing themselves of their gentleness and inability to take wing from their pursuits easily struck them down with sticks there were also many birds of the dove kind as tame as the former and caught with equal facility some of them were brought alive to this place besides these the shore abounded with sea    th the scarborough lady penrhyn and charlotte transports being cleared of government stores were discharged from the service and are shortly to depart for china in order to load home with tea they being chartered by the east india company for that purpose  april   th his excellency attended by lieutenant ball of the navy lieutenant george johnston of the marines the judge advocate myself three soldiers and two seamen landed in manly cove so called from the manly conduct of the natives when the governor first visited it on the north side of the entrance into port jackson harbor in order to trace to its source a river which had been discovered a few days before we however found this impracticable owing to a thicket and swamp which ran along the side of it the governor anxious to acquire all the knowledge of the country in his power forded the river in two places and more than up to our waists in water in hopes of being able to avoid the thicket and swamp but notwithstanding all his perseverance we were at length obliged to return and to proceed along the sea shore a mile or two to the northward depiction of bird at the end of this we fell in with a small salt water lagoon on which we found nine birds that whilst swimming most perfectly resembled the rara avis of the ancients  a black swan we discharged several shot at them but the distance was too great for execution our frequent firing however caused them to take wing and they flew toward the sea which was very near in the order that wild geese generally preserve the one before the other had we not raised them we should certainly have concluded that they were black swans but their flight gave us an opportunity of seeing some white feathers which terminated the tip of each wing in every other part they were perfectly black their size appeared not equal to that of an european swan but the shape exactly corresponded except about the wings which seemed rather small for the body we not long after discovered the great brown kings fisher of which a plate is annexed this bird has been discribed by mr latham in his general synopsis of birds vol ii p  0  nearly to the following purport  the length eighteen inches the bill black above and white beneath the feathers of the head narrow and pretty long so as to form a kind of crest they are of a brown color streaked with paler brown the back and wings in general brown the lower part of the back and rump pale bluegreen the outer edges of the quills blue within and the tips black on the wing covert is a patel of glossy bluegreen the tail is barred with ferruginous and steelblack glossed with purple the end for one inch white the under part of the body is white transversely streaked with dusky lines legs yellow claws black  this bird is not uncommon in many islands of the south seas being pretty frequent at new guinea from whence the specimen came from which mr latham took his description it is also an inhabitant of new holland from whence several have been sent over to england  we rounded this lagoon and proceeded four or five miles westward along the banks of a small fresh water river which emptied itself into it and had for its source only a swamp or boggy ground after we had passed this swamp we got into an immense wood the trees of which were very high and large and a considerable distance apart with little under or brush wood the ground was not very good although it produced a luxuriant coat of a kind of sour grass growing in tufts or bushes which at some distance had the appearance of meadow land and might be banksian cockatoo depiction of bird mistaken for it by superficial examiners here we pitched our tents without which the governor never traveled for the night near a swamp out of which we were supplied with water not indeed either of the best or clearest kind the night being cold and a heavy dew falling we kept up a large fire before the tents which though in one respect an excellent precaution far from chasing away seemed to allure the musquitos which tormented us inexpressibly during the whole night we this day discovered the banksian cockatoo this species was first described by mr latham in his seventh volume or supplement to the general synopsis of birds and the one in the plate annexed differs from that in some few particulars  in mr lathams figure the general color is dusky black the feathers of the head longer than the rest forming a crest and each of those on the head back of the neck and major part of the wings have a spot of buffcolour at the tips the under parts of the body barred with narrow bars of buffcolour the tail is black at the bottom and ends of the feathers but the middle of a fine red barred irregularly with black  in our specimen the general color of the bird is olive or rusty black the head feathers pretty long and about the sides of the head and top of it is a mixture of fine yellow but none of the feathers are marked with buff at the tips nor is the under part of the body crossed with buffcolour in the tail it differs scarcely at all from mr lathams figure  these birds have been met with in several parts of new holland  we likewise saw several bluebellied parrots this is a very beautiful bird and mr latham whose leave we have to copy the account of it from his syn vol i p     no    b describes it thus the length is fifteen inches the bill is reddish orbits black head and throat dark blue with a mixture of lighter blue feathers back part of the head green toward the throat yellow green back and wings green prime quills dusky barred with yellow breast red mixed with yellow belly of a fine blue thighs green and yellow tail cuneiform the two middle feathers green the others the same but bright yellow on the outer edges legs dusky  this bird is a very common species in various parts of new holland and in great plenty both at botany bay and port jackson it is found to differ much in plumage several other varieties having been met with which are natives of amboina and others of the molucca islands    th we pursued our route westward proceeding many miles inland without being able to trace by a single vestige that the natives had been recently in those parts we saw however some proofs of their ingenuity in various figures cut on the smooth surface of some large stones they consisted chiefly of representations of themselves in different attitudes of their canoes of several sorts of fish and animals and considering the rudeness of the instruments with which the figures must have been executed they seemed to exhibit tolerably strong likenesses on the stones where the natives had been thus exercising their abilities in sculpture were several weatherbeaten shells the country all around this place was rather high and rocky and the soil arid parched and inhospitable  in the evening after a long and fatiguing march we fell in with the northwest branch of port jackson harbor here the two seamen overcome with fatigue and having their shoes torn from their feet through the ruggedness of the road along which we had traveled could proceed no further this circumstance induced the governor to consign them to the care of lieutenant ball and a marine supplying them with provisions sufficient to last them till they reached the ships his excellency with the rest of the party pushed on to the westward by the water side in hopes of finding better land and a more open country about four oclock in the afternoon we came to a steep valley where the flowing of the tide ceased and a fresh water stream commenced here in the most desert wild and solitary seclusion that the imagination can form any idea of we took up our abode for the night dressed our provisions washed our shirts and stockings and turned our inconvenient situation to the best advantage in our power saw this day the anomalous hornbill of which a plate is annexed this bird is so very singular in its several characteristics that it can scarcely be said to which of the present known genera to refer it in the bill it seems most allied to the hornbill but the legs are those of a toucan and the tongue is more like that of a crow than any other it must therefore be left to future ornithologists to determine the point resting here satisfied with describing its external appearance  the size of the body is not much less than that of a crow the bill is very large and bent particularly at the tip of the anamolous hernbill depiction of bird upper mandible the nostrils and space round the eyes are bare and red the head neck and all beneath are of a pale gray crossed over the thighs with dusky lines the back and wings dusky leadcolour with the end of each feather black the tail is long and wedgeshaped the feathers white at the ends near which is a bar of black the bill and legs are brown the toes are placed two before and two behind as in the parrot or toucan genus  this singular bird was met with at new holland from whence three or four specimens have found their way to england but whether it is a numerous species has not been mentioned  the next morning we hid our tents and the remains of our provisions and with only a little rum and a small quantity of bread made a forced march into the country to the westward of about fourteen miles without being able to succeed in the object of our search which was for good land well watered indeed the land here although covered with an endless wood was better than the parts which we had already explored finding it however very unlikely that we should be able to penetrate through this immense forest and circumstanced as we were it was thought more prudent to return we accordingly after an expeditious walk reached the stream from whence we had set out in the morning and taking up the tents and provisions which we had left proceeded a little farther down to the flowing of the tide and there pitched our tents for the night during which it rained very heavily with thunder and lightning the wattled beeeater of which a plate is annexed fell in our way during the course of the day this bird is the size of a missel thrush but much larger in proportion its total length being about fourteen inches the feathers on the upper part of the head longer than the rest give the appearance of a crest those of the under part are smooth the plumage for the most part is brown the feathers long and pointed and each feather has a streak of white down the middle under the eye on each side is a kind of wattle of an orange color the middle of the belly is yellow the tail is wedgeshaped similar to that of the magpie and the feathers tipped with white the bill and legs are brown  this bird seems to be peculiar to new holland and is undoubtedly a species which has not hitherto been described    th we began our progress early in the morning wattled be eater depiction of bird the wattled be eater female depiction of bird bending our course down the river some places along the shore where the tide had flowed so as to obstruct our passage we were obliged to ford and at times we were under the necessity of climbing heights nearly inaccessible at length after undergoing much fatigue we were agreeably surprised and cheered with the sight of two boats sent by captain hunter to meet us and just then coming up with the tide by them we learnt that lieutenant ball with his enfeebled party had arrived safe at the ship the day after they had quitted us we all went on board the boats and fell down the river till we got to a pleasant little cove where we dined with great satisfaction and comfort upon the welcome provisions which were sent in the boats by the governors steward after having refreshed ourselves we again embarked and about six oclock in the evening arrived in sydney cove  we were likewise able during this excursion to take one of the goldwinged pigeons of which a plate is annexed this bird is a curious and singular species remarkable for having most of the feathers of the wing marked with a brilliant spot of golden yellow changing in various reflections of light to green and copperbronze and when the wing is closed forming two bars of the same across it the general color of the bird otherwise is brown changing to vinaceous red on the breast in the manner of our domestic species the fore part of the head and chin are buff color with a streak of brownish red passing on each side through the eye the quills and tail are darker than the rest of the plumage but all the feathers of the last except the two middle ones incline to lead color with a bar of black near the tip the bill and legs are of a dull red  this species is a native of new south wales several of them having been sent from port jackson    d on the morning of this day the governor accompanied by the same party with the addition of lieutenant cresswell of the marines and six privates landed at the head of the harbor with an intention of penetrating into the country westward as far as seven days provisions would admit of every individual carrying his own allowance of bread beef rum and water the soldiers beside their own provisions carried a camp kettle and two tents with their poles etc thus equipped with the additional weight of spare shoes shirts trowsers together with a great coat or scotch played for the purpose of sleeping in as golden winged pidgeon depiction of bird the nights were cold we proceeded on our destination we likewise took with us a small hand hatchet in order to mark the trees as we went on those marks called in america blazing being the only guide to direct us in our return the country was so rugged as to render it almost impossible to explore our way by the assistance of the compass  in this manner we proceeded for a mile or two through a part well covered with enormous trees free from underwood we then reached a thicket of brushwood which we found so impervious as to oblige us to return nearly to the place from whence we had set out in the morning here we encamped near some stagnant water for the night during which it thundered lightened and rained about eleven oclock the governor was suddenly attacked with a most violent complaint in his side and loins brought on by cold and fatigue not having perfectly gotten the better of the last expedition the next morning being fine his excellency who was rather better though still in pain would not relinquish the object of his pursuit and therefore we proceeded and soon got round the wood or thicket which had harassed us so much the day before after we had passed it we fell in with an hitherto unperceived branch of port jackson harbor along the bank of which the grass was tolerably rich and succulent and in height nearly up to the middle interspersed with a plant much resembling the indigo we followed this branch westward for a few miles until we came to a small fresh water stream that emptied itself into it here we took up our quarters for the night as our halts were always regulated by fresh water an essential point by no means to be dispensed with and not very abundant or frequently to be met with in this country we made a kettle of excellent soup out of a white cockatoo and two crows which i had shot as we came along the land all around us was similar to that which we had passed at night we had thunder lightning and rain the governor though not free from pain was rather recovering    th as soon as the dew which is remarkably heavy in this country was off the ground we proceeded to trace the river or small arm of the sea the banks of it were now pleasant the trees immensely large and at a considerable distance from each other and the land around us flat and rather low but well covered with the kind of grass just mentioned here the tide ceased to flow and all further progress for boats was stopped by a flat space of large broad stones over which a fresh water stream ran just above this flat close to the waterside we discovered a quarry of slates from which we expected to derive great advantage in respect to covering our houses stores etc it being a material beyond conception difficult to be procured in this country but on trial it was found of no use as it proved to be of a crumbling and rotten nature on this fresh water stream as well as on the salt we saw a great many ducks and teal three of which we shot in the course of the day besides two crows and some loraquets about four in the afternoon being near the head of the stream and somewhat apprehensive of rain we pitched our tents before the grass became wet a circumstance which would have proved very uncomfortable during the night here we had our ducks picked stuffed with some slices of salt beef and roasted and never did a repast seem more delicious the salt beef serving as a palatable substitute for the want of salt gave it an agreeable relish the evening cleared up and the night proved dry during the latter we heard a noise which not a little surprised us on acoount of its resemblance to the human voice what it proceeded from we could not discover but i am of opinion that it was made by a bird or some animal the country round us was by no means so good or the grass so abundant as that which we had passed the water though neither clear nor in any great quantity was neither of a bad quality nor illtasted  the next day after having sowed some seeds we pursued our route for three or four miles west where we met with a mean hut belonging to some of the natives but could not perceive the smallest trace of their having been there lately close to this hut we saw a kangaroo which had come to drink at an adjacent pool of stagnated water but we could not get within shot of it a little farther on we fell in with three huts as deserted as the former and a swamp not unlike the american rice grounds near this we saw a tree in flames without the least appearance of any natives from which we suspected that it had been set on fire by lightning this circumstance was first suggested by lieutenant ball who had remarked as well as myself that every part of the country though the most inaccessible and rocky appeared as if at certain times of the year it had been all on fire indeed in many parts we met with very large trees the trunks of which and branches were evidently rent and demolished by lightning close by the burning tree we saw three kangaroos though by this time very much fatigued we proceeded about two miles farther on in hopes of finding some good water but without effect and about half past four oclock we took up our quarters near a stagnant pool the ground was so very dry and parched that it was with some difficulty we could drive either our tent pegs or poles into it the country about this spot was much clearer of underwood than that which we had passed during the day the trees around us were immensely large and the tops of them filled with loraquets and paroquets of exquisite beauty which chattered to such a degree that we could scarcely hear each other speak we fired several times at them but the trees were so very high that we killed but few    th we still directed our course westward and passed another tree on fire and others which were hollow and perforated by a small hole at the bottom in which the natives seemed to have snared some animal it was certainly done by the natives as the trees where these holes or perforations were had in general many knotches cut for the purpose of getting to the top of them after this we crossed a watercourse which shows that at some seasons the rain is very heavy here notwithstanding that there was at present but little water in it beyond the chasm we came to a pleasant hill the top of which was tolerably clear of trees and perfectly free from underwood his excellency gave it the name of belle veue from the top of this hill we saw a chain of hills or mountains which appeared to be thirty or forty miles distant running in a north and south direction the northernmost being conspicuously higher than any of the rest the governor called it richmond hill the next or those in the center lansdown hills and those to the southward which are by much the lowest carmarthen hills  in a valley below belle veue we saw a fire and by it found some chewed root of a saline taste which showed that the natives had recently been there the country hereabout was pleasant to the eye well wooded and covered with long sour grass growing in tufts at the bottom of this valley or flat we crossed another watercourse and ascended a hill where the wood was so very thick as to obstruct our view here finding our provisions to run short our return was concluded on though with great reluctance as it was our wish and had been our determination to reach the hills before us if it had been possible in our way back which we easily discovered by the marks made in the trees we saw a hollow tree on fire the smoke issuing out of the top part as through a chimney on coming near and minutely examining it we found that it had been set on fire by the natives for there was some dry grass lighted and put into the hole wherein we had supposed they used to snare or take the animal before alluded to in the evening where we pitched our tents we shot two crows and some loraquets for supper the night was fine and clear during which we often heard as before a sound like the human voice and from its continuance on one spot we concluded it to proceed from a bird perched on some of the trees near us    th we now found ourselves obliged to make a forced march back as our provisions were quite exhausted a circumstance rather alarming in case of losing our way which however we met with no difficulty in discovering by the marked trees by our calculation we had penetrated into the country to the westward not less than thirtytwo or thirtythree miles this day we saw the dung of an animal as large as that of a horse but it was more like the excrement of a hog intermixed with grass when we got as far back as the arm or branch of the sea which forms the upper part of port jackson harbor we saw many ducks but could not get within shot of any of them it was now growing late and the governor being apprehensive that the boats which he had ordered to attend daily might be for that day returning before we could reach them he sent lieutenants johnston and cresswell with a marine ahead in order to secure such provisions as might have been sent up and to give directions for the boats to come for us the next morning as it then appeared very unlikely that all the party who were without exception much fatigued could be there soon enough to save the tide down those gentlemen accordingly went forward and were so fortunate as to be just in time and they returned to us with a seasonable supply of bread beef rum and wine as soon as they had joined us we encamped for the night on a spot about the distance of a mile from the place where the boats were to take us up in the morning his excellency was again indisposed occasioned by a return of his complaint which had been brought on by a fall into a hollow place in the ground that being concealed by the long grass he was unable to discern we passed the next day in examining different inlets in the upper part of the harbor we saw there some of the natives who in their canoes came alongside of the boat to receive some trifles which the governor held out to them in the evening we returned to sydney cove  may  st james bennet a youth was executed for robbing a tent belonging to the charlotte transport of sugar and some other articles before he was turned off he confessed his guilt and acknowledged that young as he was he had been an old offender some other trifling thefts were brought before the court at the same time and those concerned in them sentenced to receive corporeal punishment  the supply tender sailed for lord howes island to fetch turtle as did the lady penrhyn transport for china the scarborough dropped down the harbor she was followed the next day by the charlotte and they sailed in company for    st william airs a convict who was in a state of convalescence and to whom i had given permission to go a little way into the country for the purpose of gathering a few herbs wherewith to make tea was after night brought to the hospital with one of the spears used by the natives sticking in his loins it had been darted at him as he was stooping and while his back was turned to the assailant the weapon was barbed and stuck so very fast that it would admit of no motion after dilating the wound to a considerable length and depth with some difficulty i extracted the spear which had penetrated the flesh nearly three inches after the operation he informed us that he received his wound from three of the natives who came behind him at a time when he suspected no person to be near him except peter burn whom he had met a little before employed on the same business as himself he added that after they had wounded him they beat him in a cruel manner and stripping the clothes from his back port jackson thrush depiction of bird carried them off making signs to him as he interpreted them to return to the camp he further related that after they had left him he saw burn in the possession of another party of the natives who were dragging him along with his head bleeding and seemingly in great distress while he himself was so exhausted with loss of blood that instead of being able to assist his companion he was happy to escape with his life  the port jackson thrush of which a plate is annexed inhabits the neighborhood of port jackson the top of the head in this species is blueishgrey from thence down the hind part of the neck and the back the color is a fine chocolate brown the wings and tail are lead color the edges of the feathers pale the tail itself pretty long and even at the end all the under parts from chin to vent are duskywhite except the middle of the neck just above the breast which inclines to chocolate the bill is of a dull yellow legs brown    th the supply arrived from lord howes island without a single turtle the object for which she was sent a dreadful disappointment to those who were languishing under the scurvy many of whom are since dead and there is great reason to fear that several others will soon share the same fate this disorder has now risen to a most alarming height without any possibility of checking it until some vegetables can be raised which from the season of the year cannot take place for many months and even then i am apprehensive that there will not be a sufficiency produced such are the labor and difficulty which attend the clearing of the ground it will scarcely be credited when i declare that i have known twelve men employed for five days in grubbing up one tree and when this has been effected the timber as already observed has been only fit for firewood so that in consequence of the great labor in clearing of the ground and the weak state of the people to which may be added the scarcity of tools most of those we had being either worn out by the hardness of the timber or lost in the woods among the grass through the carelessness of the convicts the prospect before us is not of the most pleasing kind all the stock that was landed both public and private seems instead of thriving to fall off exceedingly the number at first was but inconsiderable and even that number is at present much diminished the sheep in particular decreaser apidly very few being now alive in the colony although there were numbers the property of government or individuals when first landed    th two men of the sirius were brought before the criminal court and tried for assaulting and beating in a cruel manner another man belonging to the same vessel while employed on an island appropriated by the governor to the use of the ship they were sentenced to receive five hundred lashes each but could not undergo the whole of that punishment as like most of the persons in the colony they were much afflicted with the scurvy    th captain hunter his first lieutenant and the surgeon of the sirius went to the point of land which forms the north head of port jackson in going there they discovered an old man with a little girl about five years of age lying close to the ground watching their motions and at the same time endeavoring to conceal themselves the surgeon had his gun with him the effects of which he let the old man see by shooting a bird which fell at his feet the explosion at first greatly alarmed him but perceiving that they intended him no ill he soon got over his fears the bird was then given to him which having barely plucked and not more than half broiled it he devoured entrails bones and all the little girl was much frightened and endeavored to hide herself behind the old man to escape the least observation   0th captain campbell of the marines who had been up the harbor to procure some rushes for thatch brought to the hospital the bodies of william okey and samuel davis two rushcutters whom he had found murdered by the natives in a shocking manner okey was transfixed through the breast with one of their spears which with great difficulty and force was pulled out he had two other spears sticking in him to a depth which must have proved mortal his skull was divided and comminuted so much that his brains easily found a passage through his eyes were out but these might have been picked away by birds davis was a youth and had only some trifling marks of violence about him this lad could not have been many hours dead for when captain campbell found him which was among some mangrovetrees and at a considerable distance from the place where the other man lay he was not stiff nor very cold nor was he perfectly so when brought to the hospital from these circumstances we have been led to think that while they were dispatching okey he had crept to the yellow eared fly catcher depiction of bird trees among which he was found and that fear united with the cold and wet in a great degree contributed to his death what was the motive or cause of this melancholy catastrophe we have not been able to discover but from the civility shown on all occasions to the officers by the natives whenever any of them were met i am strongly inclined to think that they must have been provoked and injured by the convicts we this day caught a yelloweared flycatcher see annexed plate this bird is a native of new holland the size of a martin and nearly seven inches in length the bill is broad at the bottom and of a pale color the legs dusky the plumage is mostly brown mottled with paler brown the edges of the wing feathers yellowish the under part of the body white inclining to dusky about the chin and throat the tail is pretty long and when spread seems hollowed out at the tip beneath the eye on each side is an irregular streak growing wider and finishing on the ears of a yellow or gold color  early the next morning the governor lieutenants g johnston and kellow myself six soldiers and two armed convicts whom we took as guides went to the place where the murder had been committed in hopes by some means or other to be able to find out either the actual perpetrators or those concerned as most of their clothes and all their working tools were carried off we expected that these might furnish us with some clue but in this we were disappointed we could not observe a single trace of the natives ever having been there we then crossed the country to botany bay still flattering ourselves that we might be able to discover among a tribe at that place some proof that they had been concerned as the governor was resolved on whomsoever he found any of the tools or clothing to show them his displeasure and by every means in his power endeavor to convince them of his motives for such a procedure in our route we saw several kangaroos and shot a very fine teal a little before sunset after a long and fatiguing march we arrived at botany bay when we approached the bay we saw eleven canoes with two persons in each fishing most of them had a fire in their canoe a convenience which they seldom go without at any time or season but particularly at this as the weather was very cold here we pitched our tents for as i have before observed we never travel without them and kindled large fires both in front and rear still however the cold was so very intense that we could scarcely close our eyes during the night in the morning the grass was quite white with a hoar frost so as to crackle under our feet after breakfast we visited the grave of the french abbe who died whilst the count de peyrouse was here it was truly humble indeed being distinguished only by a common headstone stuck slightly into the loose earth which covered it against a tree just above it was nailed a board with the following inscription on it hic jacet le receveur ex f f minoribus gallia sacerdos physicus in circumnavigatione mundi duce d de la peyrouse obiit die   th febr anno      as the painting on the board could not be permanent governor phillip had the inscription engraved on a plate of copper and nailed to the same tree and at some future day he intends to have a handsome headstone placed at the grave we cut down some trees which stood between that on which the inscription is fixed and the shore as they prevented persons passing in boats from seeing it  between this and the harbours mouth we found fortynine canoes hauled upon the beach but not a native to be seen after we had passed them we fell in with an indian path and as it took a turn toward the camp we followed it about two miles when on a sudden in a valley or little bay to the northward of botany bay we were surprised at hearing the sound of voices which we instantly found to proceed from a great number of the natives sitting behind a rock who appeared to be equally astonished with ourselves as from the silence we observed they had not perceived us till we were within twenty yards of them every one of them as they got up armed himself with a long spear the short stick before described used in throwing it a shield made of bark and either a large club pointed at one end or a stone hatchet at first they seemed rather hostilely inclined and made signs with apparent tokens of anger for us to return but when they saw the governor advance toward them unarmed and with his hands opened wide a signal we had observed among them of amity and peace they with great confidence came up to him and received from him some trifles which he had in his pocket such as fishhooks beads and a lookingglass as there appeared not to be less than three hundred of them in this bay all armed the soldiers were ordered to fix their bayonets and to observe a close well connected order of march as they descended the hill these people as already mentioned seem to dislike red coats and those who carry arms but on the present occasion they showed very little fear or distrust on the contrary they in a few minutes mixed with us and conducted us to a very fine stream of water out of which some of them drank to show that it was good the women and children kept at some distance one or two more forward than the rest excepted who came to the governor for some presents while he was distributing his gifts the women danced an exercise every description of people in this country seem fond of and threw themselves into some not very decent attitudes  the men in general had their skins smeared all over with grease or some stinking oily substance some wore a small stick or fishbone fixed crossways in the division of the nose which had a very strange appearance others were painted in a variety of ways and had their hair ornamented with the teeth of fish fastened on by gum and the skin of the kangaroo as they conducted us to the water a toadstool was picked up by one of our company which some of the natives perceiving they made signs for us to throw it away as not being good to eat soon after i gathered some wood sorrel which grew in our way but none of them endeavored to prevent me from eating it on the contrary if a conclusion may be drawn from the signs which they made relative to the toadstool they showed by their looks that there was nothing hurtful in it  we halted but a short time with them as it was growing late and we had a long way to walk before we parted from them the governor gave them two small handaxes in exchange for some of their stone axes and two of their spears as we ascended a hill after our departure from them eight of them followed us until we had nearly reached the top where one of those who had been most familiar with us made signs for us to stop which we readily complying with he ran to the summit and made a strange kind of hallooing holding at the same time his hands open above his head as soon as we came up to him we discovered another large body of them in a bay about half a mile below us our new friend seemed anxious to carry us down to them but it not being in our way we declined his offer seeing us take another direction he halted and opened his hands in order as we supposed to put us in mind that he had received nothing from us upon which we presented him with a bird the only thing we had with which he returned to appearance fully content and satisfied we now proceeded toward the camp where we arrived about sunset  this was the greatest number of the natives we had ever seen together since our coming among them what could be the cause of their assembling in such numbers gave rise to a variety of conjectures some thought they were going to war among themselves as they had with them a temporary store of halfstinking fish and fernroot the latter of which they use for bread this we remarked as several of them were eating it at the time we were among them others conjectured that some of them had been concerned in the murder of our men notwithstanding we did not meet with the smallest trace to countenance such an opinion and that fearing we should revenge it they had formed this convention in order to defend themselves against us others imagined that the assemblage might be occasioned by a burial a marriage or some religious meeting  the tabuan parrot one of which was observed here and of which a plate is annexed is a bird about eighteen inches in length and bigger than the scarlet lory the head neck and under parts are of a fine scarlet the upper parts of the body and wings are of a beautiful green across the upper part of the wing coverts is an oblique bar of yellowish green more glossy than the rest the lower part of the back and rump is blue there is also a small patch of blue at the lower part of the neck behind between a scarlet and green dividing those colors the tail is pretty long and of an olive brown color the bill is reddish the legs deep brown nearly black  the female is mostly green the head neck and under parts olive brown belly red rump blue tail on the upper surface green beneath dusky  tabuan parrot depiction of bird  the tabuan parrot female depiction of bird  the above inhabits botany bay and seems much allied to the tabuan parrot described by mr latham in his synopsis of birds but in that the head neck and under parts incline to purplish or chocolate color both quills and tail are blue more or less edged with green and a crescent of blue at the back part of the neck it has also the under jaw surrounded with green feathers it is probable therefore that our bird is only a variety of the tabuan species  june  th this being the anniversary of his majestys birthday and the first celebration of it in new south wales his excellency ordered the sirius and supply to fire twentyone guns at sunrise at one oclock and at sunset immediately after the kings ships had ceased firing at one oclock the borrowdale friendship fishburne golden grove and prince of wales fired five guns each the battalion was under arms at twelve and fired three vollies succeeded by three cheers after this ceremony had taken place the lieutenant governor with all the officers of the settlement civil and military paid their respects to his excellency at his house at two oclock they all met there again to dinner during which the band of music pitted against any that ever conducted the affairs of great britain  when all the public toasts had gone round the governor nominated the district which he had taken possession of cumberland county and gave it such an extent of boundary as to make it the largest county in the whole world his excellency said that he had intended to have named the town and laid the first stone on this auspicious day but the unexpected difficulties which he had met with in clearing the ground and from a want of artificers had rendered it impossible he therefore put it off till a future day its name however we understand is to be albion the day was passed in cheerfulness and good humor but it was a little damped by our perceiving that the governor was in great pain from a return of his complaint though his countenance too plainly indicated the torture which he suffered he took every method in his power to conceal it lest it should break in upon the festivity and harmony of the day his excellency ordered every soldier a pint of porter besides his allowance of grog and every convict half a pint of spirits made into grog that they all may drink his majestys health and as it was a day of general rejoicing and festivity he likewise made it a day of forgiveness remitting the remainder of the punishment to which the sailors of the sirius were subject and pardoning lovel sideway hall and gordon who had been confined on a little sterile island or rather rock situated in the harbor until a place of banishment could be found this act of lenity and mercy added to many others which the governor had shown it is to be hoped will work some change on the minds of these men indeed some good may be expected from hall and gordon who since their sentence have appeared penitent but from lovel and sideway very little change for the better can be expected because they seem so truly abandoned and incorrigible at night every person attended an immense bonfire that was lighted for the occasion after which the principal officers of the settlement and of the men of war supped at the governors where they terminated the day in pleasantry good humor and cheerfulness  the next morning we were astonished at the number of thefts which had been committed during the general festivity by the villainous part of the convicts on one another and on some of the officers whose servants did not keep a strict lookout after their marquees availing themselves thus of the particular circumstances of the day is a strong instance of their unabated depravity and want of principle scarcely a day passes without an example being made of some one or other of these wretches but it seems to have no manner of effect upon them   0th john ascott and patrick burn two convicts were brought before the criminal court and prosecuted by lieutenant g william maxwell of the sirius and mr kelter the master of the same ship for having a few nights before in a riotous manner with many more of the convicts attacked some seamen belonging to the men of war and behaving in an insolent and contemptuous manner to them after a long and judicious hearing the prisoners were acquitted as the charge brought against them was by no means substantiated    th about four in the afternoon a slight shock of an earthquake was felt at sidney cove and its environs this incident had so wonderful an effect on edward corbett a convict who had eloped about three weeks before on a discovery being made of his having stolen a frock that he returned and gave himself up to justice a few days antecedent to his return he had been outlawed and was supposed to have driven off with him four cows the only animals of this kind in the colony this however he declared himself innocent of but confessed his having committed the theft laid to his charge the strictest search was made but in vain after the cows it is probable that they have strayed so far off in this endless wild as to be irrecoverably lost previously to the return of corbett he must have suffered very severely from hunger his eyes were sunk into his head and his whole appearance showed that he had been half starved while he was absent he says he frequently fell in with the natives who though they never treated him ill did not seem to like his company he informed us that in a bay adjacent to that where the governor and his party had met with so many of the natives he saw the head of one of the convicts lying near the place where the body had been burnt in a large fire this in all likelihood was burn who was carried off at the time airs was wounded as he has not been heard of since  the natives of this country though their mode of subsisting seems to be so very scanty and precarious are i am convinced not cannibals one of their graves which i saw opened the only one i have met with contained a body which had evidently been burned as small pieces of the bones lay in the bottom of it the grave was neatly made and well covered with earth and boughs of trees  the pennantian parrot of which see plate annexed was about this time first noticed the general color of the body in the male is crimson the feathers of the back black in their middle the chin and throat blue the wings blue with a bar of a paler color down the middle of them the tail is long and blue also and all but the two middle feathers have the ends very pale  the female differs in having the upper parts of the neck and body of a greenish color the top of the head red and a patch of the same under each eye the chin and pennantian parrot depiction of bird pennantian parrot female depiction of bird throat blue lower part of the neek and breast red as are the rump and vent the middle of the belly dusky green tail dark blue fringed with chestnut shoulders blue the rest of the wing the same but darker bill and legs as in the male    th the governor revoked the decree by which corbett was outlawed and he was tried by the criminal court simply for the theft he had committed and sentenced to be hanged samuel payton a convict likewise received the same sentence for feloniously entering the marquee of lieutenant fuzer on the night of the fourth of june and stealing from thence some shirts stockings and combs his trial had been put off to the present time on account of a wound in his head which he had received from captain lieutenant meredith who on his return from the bonfire found payton in his marquee when brought to the hospital in consequence of the wound which he had received he was perfectly senseless during the time he remained under my care i frequently admonished him to think of the perilous situation he then stood in and to make known the accomplices whom he was supposed to have but he firmly and uniformly denied his guilt and disclaimed his having any knowledge of or concern in robbing lieutenant fuzer he further said that he did not recollect how he came to captain lieutenant merediths tent or any circumstance relative to it however since he received his sentence he has confessed that he robbed lieutenant fuzer and gave him information where to find the articles he had been robbed of he at the same time acknowledged that he entered mr merediths marquee with an intention to rob him doubting not but he should be able to make his escape undiscovered as every one seemed so fully engaged on the pleasures of the day  when he and corbett were brought to the fatal tree they particularly payton addressed the convicts in a pathetic eloquent and welldirected speech he acknowledged the justice of his sentence a sentence which he said he had long deserved he added that he hoped and trusted that the ignominious death he was about to suffer would serve as a caution and warning to those who saw and heard him they both prayed most fervently begging forgiveness of an offended god they likewise hoped that those whom they had injured would not only forgive them as they themselves did all mankind but offer up their prayers to a merciful redeemer that though so great sinners they might be received into that bliss which the good and virtuous only can either deserve or expect they were now turned off and in the agonizing moments of the separation of the soul from the body seemed to embrace each other the execution of these unhappy youths the eldest of whom was not twentyfour years of age which seemed to make a greater impression on the convicts than any circumstance had done since their landing will induce them it is to be hoped to change their conduct and to adopt a better mode of life than i am sorry to say they have hitherto pursued  the principal business now going forward is the erecting huts for the marines and convicts with the cabbagetree we have been here nearly six months and four officers only as yet got huts when the rest will be provided with them seems uncertain but this i well know that living in tents as the rainy season has commenced is truly uncomfortable and likely to give a severe trial to the strongest and most robust constitution  the trees of this country are immensely large and clear of branches to an amazing height while standing many of them look fair and good to the eye and appear sufficient to make a mast for the largest ship but when cut down they are scarcely convertible to any use whatever at the heart they are full of veins through which an amazing quantity of an astringent red gum issues this gum i have found very serviceable in an obstinate dysentery that raged at our first landing and still continues to do so though with less obstinacy and violence when these trees are sawed and any way exposed to the sun the gum melts or gets so very brittle that the wood falls to pieces and appears as if the pieces had been joined together with this substance how any kind of houses except those built of the cabbage tree can be raised up the timber being so exceedingly bad it is impossible to determine  i have already said that the stone of this country is well calculated for building could any kind of cement be found to keep them together as for limestone we have not yet discovered any in the country and the shells collected for that purpose have been but inconsiderable from captain cooks account one would be led to suppose that oyster and cockle shells might be procured in such quantities as to make a sufficiency of lime for the purpose of constructing at least a few public buildings but this is by no means the case that great navigator notwithstanding his usual accuracy and candor was certainly too lavish of his praises on botany bay  the peculiarity i have mentioned relative to the wood of this place is strange there are only three kinds of it and neither of them will float on the water we have found another resin here not unlike the balsam tolu in smell and effect but differing widely in color being of a clear yellow which exudes from the tree this however is not to be met with in such quantities as the red gum before mentioned nor do i think that its medicinal virtues are by any means so powerful a kind of earth has been discovered which makes good bricks but we still are in want of a cement for them as well as for the stone  what animals we have yet met with have been mostly of the opossum kind the kangaroo so very accurately delineated by captain cook is certainly of that class and the largest animal seen in the country one has been brought into camp which weighed a hundred and fortynine pounds see plate annexed the conformation of this animal is peculiarly singular its hinder parts have great muscular power and are perhaps beyond all parallel out of proportion when compared with the fore parts as it goes it jumps on its two hind legs from twenty to twentyeight feet and keeps the two fore ones close to the breast these are small and short and it seems to use them much like a squirrel the tail of these animals is thick and long they keep it extended and it serves as a kind of counterpoise to the head which they carry erect when bounding at full speed the velocity of a kangaroo as far outstrips that of a greyhound as that animal exceeds in swiftness a common dog it is a very timid shy and inoffensive creature evidently of the granivorous kind upon our first discovering one of them as it does not use its fore feet to assist it in running or rather jumping many were of opinion that the tail which is immensely large and long was made use of by them in the act of progression but this is by no means the case had it been used in such a manner the hair would probably have been worn away from the part which of course must be applied to the ground the tail from its size and weight seems to serve it for a weapon both of defense and offense for it does not appear that nature has provided it with any other its mouth and head even when full grown are too small for it to do much execution with the teeth nor is the conformation of either at all calculated for the purpose indeed its fore feet which it uses as a squirrel or monkey to handle any thing with and which assist it in lying down are too small and out of proportion as are all the superior parts to admit of its either possessing or exerting much strength it has been reported by some convicts who were out one day accompanied by a large newfoundland dog that the latter seized a very large kangaroo but could not preserve its hold they observed that the animal effected its escape by the defensive use it made of its tail with which it struck its assailant in a most tremendous manner the blows were applied with such force and efficacy that the dog was bruised in many places till the blood flowed they observed that the kangaroo did not seem to make any use of either its teeth or fore feet but fairly beat off the dog with its tail and escaped before the convicts though at no great distance could get up to secure it  the female has a pouch or pocket like the opossum in which she carries her young some have been shot with a young one not larger than a walnut sticking to a teat in this pocket others with young ones not bigger than a rat one of which most perfectly formed with every mark and distinguishing characteristic of the kangaroo i have sent to mr wilson of gower street bedford square  there is a peculiar formation in the generative parts of this animal of its natural history we at present know little and therefore as we are so unacquainted with its habits haunts and customs to attempt particular and accurate descriptions of it might beget error which time or a fuller knowledge of its properties would directly contradict as to mere conjectures and such too often are imposed upon the public for incontestible facts it cannot be improper to suppress them  every animal in this country partakes in a great measure of the nature of the kangaroo we have the kangaroo opossum the kangaroo rat etc in fact every quadruped that we have seen except the flying squirrel and a spotted creature nearly the size of a martin resembles the kangaroo in the formation of the fore legs and feet which bear no proportion to the length of the hind legs  the scarcity of boats will prevent our being so well supplied with fish as otherwise might be expected fish is far from abounding at the cold season of the year but in the summer judging from the latter end of the last we have every reason to conclude that the little bays and coves in the harbor are well stored with them the fish caught here are in general excellent but several of them like the animals in some degree resembling the kangaroo partake of the properties of the shark the land the grass the trees the animals the birds and the fish in their different species approach by strong shades of similitude to each other a certain likeness runs through the whole  july  th a party of the natives came to the place where the siriuss boat had been to haul the seine and having beaten the crew took from them by force a part of the fish which they had caught it is a great misfortune to us that we cannot find proper wood in this place wherewith to build a boat particularly as fish is not only so very plentiful in the summer but the only change from salt provisions which we can procure there being neither wild nor domestic animals fit for food here where no other animal nourishment is to be procured the kangaroo is considered as a dainty but in any other country i am sure that such food would be thrown to  a few days since a civil court of jurisdiction which consisted of the judge advocate the reverend mr johnson and myself was convened by his excellency to hear a complaint made against duncan sinclair master of the alexander transport by henry coble and susannah his wife the norwich convicts who so much excited the public attention for the nondelivery of a parcel sent on board the alexander by mrs jackson of somerset street containing wearing apparel books and other things for the use of the said henry coble his wife and child value twenty pounds the parcel was proved and this even by the acknowledgment of the master to have been received on board and it likewise appeared in evidence that on moving it from one part of the ship to another the package had broken and the books had fallen out which books the convict said had been delivered to him the court after deducting five pounds the value of the books received gave a verdict in favor of the couple in whose cause the world had seemed so much to interest and in consequence of the authority unto them granted by act of parliament in such cases made and provided they adjudged the master of the transport fully to compensate the loss of the convicts amounting to fifteen pounds sinclair considered it as oppressive to be obliged to pay for that on account of which he had not received any freightage but this objection had no weight with the court as the ship was in the service of government and paid for the sole purpose of conveying these people and the little property which they possessed to this country  july   th the alexander friendship and prince of wales transports with the borrowdale victualler sailed for england his majestys brig the supply sailed at the same time for norfolk island with provisions etc for the people there    st i went down the harbor with the master of the golden grove victualler to look for a cabbage tree as a covering for my hut on our return we fell in with three canoes that had been out fishing we rowed toward them when the natives in them suddenly appeared intimidated and paddled away with all possible dispatch willing to convince them that they had nothing to dread from us we rowed after them in order to present them with some trifles which we had about us when we approached the canoes an old woman in one of them began to cast her fish overboard in great haste whether it was for fear that we should take them from her or whether she threw them to us we could not ascertain however when we came alongside our conduct soon convinced her that her alarms with respect to us were groundless she had in the canoe with her a young girl whom as she wore a complete apron we could not help considering as such an instance of female decency as we had not at any other time observed among the natives the girl did not betray the least sign of apprehension but rather seemed pleased at the interview she laughed immoderately either at us or at the petulance shown by the old woman who i believe was more terrified on the girls account than on her own after this we left them fully satisfied that we did non mean to offer them any injury  we discovered the new halland creeper see plate annexed the general color of the bird is black spotted in various parts with white the bill is dusky growing paler new holland creeper depiction of bird toward the tip the neck breast belly and sides are more or less streaked with white over the eye is also a white streak and the sides of the neck and beginning of the back have likewise some streaks of the same the quills and tail feathers are marked with yellow on the outer margins the last are rounded in shape and two or three of the outer feathers spotted within at the tip with white legs dusky is about the size of a nightingale and measures seven inches in length it is probably a nondescript species  a party of convicts who had crossed the country to botany bay to gather a kind of plant resembling balm which we found to be a good and pleasant vegetable were met by a superior number of the natives armed with spears and clubs who chased them for two miles without being able to overtake them but if they had succeeded in the pursuit it is probable that they would have put them to death for wherever persons unarmed or inferior in numbers have fallen in with them they have never failed to maltreat them the natives had with them some middling sized dogs somewhat resembling the species called in england foxdogs a servant of captain shea being one day out shooting he found a very young puppy belonging to the natives eating part of a dead kangaroo he brought it to the camp and it thrives much the dog in shape is rather short and well made has very fine hair of the nature of fur and a sagacious look when found though not more than a month old he showed some symptoms of ferocity it was a considerable time before he could be induced to eat any flesh that was boiled but he would gorge it raw with great avidity see plate annexed    d the blacksmiths shop which was built of common brush wood was burnt down very fortunately for us the bellows and the other tools were through the exertion of the people saved to effect this was no easy point as in the course of three or four minutes the wood being very dry every part of the shop was in flames    th one of the convicts was met by some of the natives who wounded him very severely in the breast and head with their spears they would undoubtedly have destroyed him had he not plunged into the sea near which he happened to be and by that means saved himself when he was brought to the hospital he was very faint from the loss of blood which had flowed plentifully from his wounds a piece of a broken spear had entered through the scalp and under his ear so that the extraction gave him great pain their spears are made of a kind of cane which grows out of the tree that produces the yellow gum they are ten or twelve feet long pointed and sometimes barbed with a piece of the same cane or the teeth of fish these they throw with the assistance of the snort stick already mentioned which has a shell made fast to the end of it with the yellow gum with this gum they likewise fasten their barbs to their spears and fishgigs the latter of these differ from the former by having four prongs and being always barbed which is not generally the case with the spears their spears the only weapon they are ever seen to have that may be considered in any degree as dangerous they throw thirty or forty yards with an unerring precision when equipped for any exploit they are also armed with a shield made of the bark of a tree with which they very dexterously ward off any thing thrown at them an humble kind of scymitar a bludgeon or club about twenty inches long with a large and pointed end and sometimes a stone hatchet make up the catalogue of their military implements  we this day shot a knobfronted beeeater see plate annexed this is about the size of a blackbird the plumage mostly brown above and white beneath the head and upper part of the neck are sparingly covered with narrow feathers almost like hairs but the fore part of the neck and breast are furnished with long ones of a white color and pointed at the ends the tail is pretty long and the feathers tipped with white the bill is about one inch in length and pale but what is most remarkable on the forehead just at the base of the bill is a short blunt knob about a quarter of an inch in length and of a brownish color the tongue is nearly of the length of the bill and bristly at the end the legs are brown this inhabits new south wales and is supposed to be a nondescript species  this day three canoes with a man and woman in each came behind the point on which the hospital is built to fish i went over to them as did two other gentlemen my assistants without their showing any fear at our coming on the contrary they manifested a friendly confidence knob fronted be eater depiction of bird we gave them some bread which they received with apparent pleasure but did not eat any of it while in our presence we likewise presented them with a lookingglass but this they received with indifference and feemed to hold in no kind of estimation i gave one of the women a pocket handkerchief which she immediately tied round hen head and showed great satisfaction she had a young child between her knees in the canoe the way in which they always carry their infants for whom she solicited something in the most suppliant tone of voice i ever heard the only thing i had about me was a narrow slip of linen which i gave her and trifling as it was she appeared to be perfectly satisfied with it and bound it round the childs head she would not come out of the came though alongside the rocks but the man quitted it and showed us some wild figs that grew near at hand such as were green and unripe he did not pull but after some search having found one that was tolerably ripe he made me pluck it and put it into his mouth he eat it with an apparent relish and smacked his lips after he had swallowed it to convince us how good it was  at some little distance from the place where we were a sheep lay dead as soon as he had discovered it he took it by the horns and as well as we could understand him he was extremely inquisitive and anxious to know what it was when his curiosity was satisfied he went into the canoe where the woman had been waiting for him about ten or twenty yards from the shore among the long grass in the shallow water he struck and took with his fishgig several good fish an acquisition to which at this season of the year it being cold and wet we were unequal while he was engaged in watching for them both he and the woman chewed something which they frequently spit into the water and which appeared to us from his immediately striking a fish to be a lure while they were thus employed one of the gentlemen with me sung some songs and when he had done the females in the canoes either sung one of their own songs or imitated him in which they succeeded beyond conception any thing spoken by us they most accurately recited and this in a manner of which we fell greatly short in our attempts to repeat their language after them  while we were thus amicably engaged all on a sudden sacred kings fisher depiction of bird they paddled away from us on looking about to discover the cause we perceived the gunner of the supply at some little distance with a gun in his hand an instrument of death against which they entertain an insuperable aversion as soon as i discovered him i called to him to stay where he was and not make a nearer approach or if he did to lay down his gun the latter request he immediately complied with and when the natives saw him unarmed they showed no further fear but returning to their employment continued alternately to sing songs and to mimic the gentlemen who accompanied me  we this day shot the sacred kingsfisher see plate

nostrils a rusty colored streak the chin the middle of the neck all round and all the under part of the body buffcolour more or less inclining to rust the upper part of the plumage chiefly blue but

prince of waless birthday the men of was fired a royal salute and all the officers in the colony civil and military dined with the governor the evening was spent in making bonfires and testifying such other demonstrations of joy as could be shown in this country the weather is now very wet and cold and has been so for the last six weeks several mornings we have had a hoar frost and a few distinct pelicles of ice were formed on shallow spots of water the thermometer frequently as low as the freezing point    th a convict who has been out gathering what they called sweet tea about a mile from the camp met a party of the natives consisting of fourteen by whom he was beaten and also slightly wounded with the shellstick used in throwing their spears they then made him strip and would have taken from him his clothes and probably his life had it not been for the report of two muskets which they no sooner heard than they ran away this party were returning from the wood with cork which they had been cutting either for their canoes or huts and had with them no other instruments than those that were necessary for the business on which they were engaged such as a stone hatchet and the shell stick before mentioned had they been armed with any other weapons the convict would probably have lost his life  that which we call the sweet tea is a creeping kind of vine running to a great extent along the ground the stalk is not so thick as the smallest honeysuckle nor is the leaf so large as the common bay leaf though something similar to it and the taste is sweet exactly like the liquorice root of the shops of this the convicts and soldiers make an infusion which is tolerably pleasant and serves as no bad succedaneum for tea indeed were it to be met with in greater abundance it would be found very beneficial to those poor creatures whose constant diet is salt provisions in using it for medical purposes i have found it to be a good pectoral and as i before observed not at all unpleasant see plate annexed we have also a kind of shrub in this country resembling the common broom which produces a small berry like a white current but in taste more similar to a very four green gooseberry this has proved a good antiscorbutic but i am sorry to add that the quantity to be met with is far from sufficient to remove the scurvy that disorder still prevails with great violence nor can we at present find any remedy against it notwithstanding that the country produces several sorts of plants and shrubs which in this place are considered as tolerable vegetables and used in common the most plentiful is a plant growing on the sea shore greatly resembling sage among it are often to be found samphire and a kind of wild spinach besides a small shrub which we distinguish by the name of the vegetable tree and the leaves of which prove rather a pleasant substitute for vegetables    d his excellency governor phillip lieutenant george johnston his adjutant of orders lieutenant cresswell of the marines myself and six soldiers landed in manly cove in order to examine the coast to broken bay at a short distance from the shore we saw sixteen canoes with two persons in each and in some three employed in fishing they seemed to take very little notice as we passed them so very intent were they on the business in which they were engaged on our landing we saw sixty more of the natives about two hundred yards distant from us some of them immediately came up to us and were very friendly a black man who carried our tents gave two of them a stocking each with which they seemed much pleased and pointing to the naked leg expressed a great desire to have that also clothed the morning was so cold that these poor wretches stood shivering on the beach and appeared to be very sensible of the comfort and advantage of being clothed  we sent back our boats and proceeded northward along the coast about six miles where we were forced to halt for near two hours until the tide had run out of a lagoon or piece of water so as to admit of its being forded while we were detained here an old native came to us and in the most friendly manner pointed out the shallowest part of the water we had to cross but the tide ran with too much rapidity at that time for us to attempt it after we had waded through one of our company shot a very fine duck which we had dressed for supper on a little eminence by the side of a cabbage tree swamp about half a mile from the run of the tide here the whole party got as much cabbage to eat with their salt provisions as they chose while we had been detained by the tide several natives were on the opposite side who also pointed out to us the shoalest water and appeared by their signs and gestures to wish us very much to come over but before the tide was sufficiently low they went away one of them wore a skin of a reddish color round his shoulders near the place where we pitched our tent we saw several quails exactly like those in england i fired four or five times at them but without success as my shot was too large    d as soon as the dew was off the grass we began our march and about twelve oclock fell in with the south branch of broken bay but finding the country round this part very rugged and the distance too great for our stock of provisions we returned to the sea shore in order to examine the south part of the entrance into the bay this like every other part of the country we have seen had a very indifferent aspect from the entrance of port jackson to broken bay in foam places from fifty to a hundred in others to two hundred yards distant from the sea the coast indeed is very pleasant and tolerably clear of wood the earth a kind of adhesive clay covered with a thick and short sour grass  all along the shore we met the natives who seem to have no fixed residence or abode but indiscriminately whenever they meet with a hut or what is more common a convenient excavation or hole in the rocks take possession of it for the time in one of their huts at broken bay which was constructed of bark and was one of the best i had ever met with we saw two very well made nets some fishing lines not inferior to the nets some spears a stone hatchet of a very superior make to what they usually have together with two vehicles for carrying water one of cork the other made out of the knot of a large tree hollowed in this hut there were two pieces of coarse linen which they must have obtained from some of our people and every thing about it bespoke more comfort and convenience than i had observed in any other a little way from it we fell in with a large party of natives whom we supposed to be the proprietors they were armed with spears and stone hatchets one of the latter they very earnestly wished to exchange for one of ours though we would readily have obliged them it was not in our power to comply with their wishes as we had only a sufficient number wherewith to cut wood for our own fires however notwithstanding our refusal they parted from us without appearing at all dissatisfied  as we proceeded along the sandy beach we gathered some beans which grew on a small creeping substance not unlike a vine they were well tasted and very similar to the english longpod bean at the place where we halted we had them boiled and we all eat very heartily of them half an hourafter the governor and i were seized with a violent vomiting we drank warm water which carrying the load freely from our stomachs gave us immediate relief two other gentlemen of the party ate as freely of them as we had done without feeling the smallest inconvenience or bad effect about this place we got some rasberries but they had not that pleasant tartness peculiar to those in europe    th we returned by the same passage along the coast without seeing any objects worth notice until we came to a convenient spot to encamp for the night where there was great plenty of cabbage trees and tolerable water a circumstance as i have already observed not generally to be met with in this country except on the sea coast and even there by no means in abundance  while soup was making of some birds we had lately killed which proved very good and every thing was getting ready for the night the governor the two other gentlemen and myself took our guns and ascended a hill just above us from this eminence we saw the southern branch of broken bay which ran far into the country during our return we picked up in the distance of about half a mile twentyfive flowers of plants and shurbs of different genera and species specimens of which i have transmitted to mr wilson particularly the red gum tree see plate annexed on the spot where we encamped the grass was long dry and sour and in such abundance that we set it on fire all around for fear the natives should surprise us in the night by doing the same a custom in which they seem always happy to indulge themselves    th we set off early in the morning to look at the branch of broken bay which we had seen the evening before and were led to it by a path not very much frequented at the head of this branch we found a fresh water river which took its rise a little above out of a swamp such is the origin and source of every river we have yet discovered in this country though few when compared to those in any other part of the world it is very extraordinary that in all this extensive tract a living spring has not yet been explored on this river we saw many ducks and teal mr cresswell shot one of the latter and i shot one of the former they were both well tasted and good of their kind at the head of this branch we found the country rough and impassable having followed the course of the river to its origin we that day returned to manly cove where we surprised two old men an old woman a grownup girl and thirteen children in a hut when the children saw us approach they all gathered themselves closely together around the girl they cried and seemed much terrified the old men showed such dislike to our looking at them that the governor and the rest of the party withdrew to some little distance to dine some of the children on seeing all the party gone but myself and another gentleman began to laugh and thus proved that their fears had vanisned when we joined the rest of the party the old man followed us in a very friendly manner and took part of every kind of provision we had but he ate none of it in our sight the women and children stood at some distance and beckoned to us when the men of whom they feemed to stand in very great dread had turned their backs  as soon as we had dined and refreshed ourselves the governor by himself went down to them and distributed some presents among them which soon gained their friendship and confidence by this time sixteen canoes that were out fishing came close to the spot where we were and there lay on their paddles which they managed with wonderful dexterity and address mimicking us and indulging in their own merriment after many signs and entreaties one of the women ventured to the governor who was by himself and with seemingly great timidity took from him some small fishing lines and hooks articles which they hold in great estimation this made her less fearful and in a little time she became perfectly free and unrestrained her conduct influenced many others who came on shore for what they could procure many of them were painted about the head breast and shoulders with some white substance none of those who were thus ornamented came on shore till by signs we made them understand that we intended to offer them some presents and even then only one of them ventured to this person lieutenant cresswell gave a white pocket handkerchief with which she seemeds much pleased every gentleman now singled out a female and presented her with some trinkets not forgetting at the same time to bestow gifts upon some of her family whom she took considerable pains to make known lest they should fall into the hands of such as did not belong to her it was remarked that all the women and children an old woman excepted had the little finger of the left hand taken off at the second joint the stump of which was as well covered as if the operation had been performed by a surgeon  while we were thus employed among the women a body of men came out of the woods with a new canoe made of cork it was one of the best we had observed in this country though it fell very short of those which i have seen among the american or musquitoshore indians who in improvements of every kind the indians of this country are many centuries behind the men had also with them some new paddles spears and fishgigs which they had just been making they readily showed us the use of every thing they had with them indeed they always behave with an apparent civility when they fall in with men that are armed but when they meet persons unarmed they seldom fail to take every advantage of them  those females who were arrived at the age of puberty did not wear a covering but all the female children and likewise the girls wore a slight kind of covering before them made of the fur of the kangaroo twisted into threads while we went toward the party of men that came out of the woods with the new canoe all the women landed and began to broil their fish of which they had a large quantity there seemed to be no harmony or hospitality among them however the female to whom i paid the most attention gave me but not until i asked her for it some of the fish which she was eating she had thrown it on the fire but it was scarcely warm  many of the women were strait well formed and lively my companion continued to exhibit a number of coquettish airs while i was decorating her head neck and arms with my pocket and neck handkerchiefs which i tore into ribbons as if desirous of multiplying two presents into several having nothing left except the buttons of my coat on her admiring them i cut them away and with a piece of string tied them round her waist thus ornamented and thus delighted with her new acquirements she turned from me with a look of inexpressible archness  before the arrival of the boats which was late the natives pointed to a hawk and made signs to us to shoot it it had alighted upon an adjoining tree and the governor desired that i would bring it down the report of the gun frightened them very much some ran away but on perceiving that no harm was intended against them they returned and were highly pleased to see the hawk presented by the governor to a young girl who appeared to be the daughter of the most distinguished amongst them  while the boats were preparing for our reception an old woman perfectly gray with age solicited us very much for some present and in order to make us comply threw herself before all her companions into the most indecent attitudes  the cockswain of the boat informed us that while he was waiting for our return the day before two parties of the natives met and commenced hostilities against each other the man thus described the manner in which this encounter was carried on a champion from each party armed with a spear and a shield pressed forwards before the rest and as soon as a favorable opportunity offered till which he advanced and retreated by turns threw his spear and then retired when another immediately took his place going through the same maneuvers and in this manner was the conflict carried on for more than two hours the boats crew and two midshipmen who saw the whole of the proceeding perceived that one of the natives walked off with a spear in his side during the engagement the women belonging to them who stood at some distance discovered strong marks of concern and screamed loudly when any of the combatants appeared to be wounded as the boat was returning close along shore a spear was thrown at the people by some of the natives who were lurking behind the trees and rocks it was hurled with such force that it flew a considerable way over the boat although we were between thirty and forty yards from the shore  it was late in the evening before we arrived in sydney cove and as soon as the governor landed he was informed that a gold mine had been discovered near the entrance of the harbor by a convict during his excellencys absence the convict had made this discovery known to the lieutenant governor and the judge advocate for which he said that he hoped and expected to have his freedom and a pecuniary reward the gentlemen to whom he applied answered that they could not promise to grant his request until he should have put them in possession of the mine but that they were well assured that the governor would bestow on him a proper recompense after sufficient proof of the discovery a boat was in consequence ordered from the sirius to carry him and captain campbell down to the place where he declared that the mine was situated at their landing he begged leave to withdraw a little on some necessary occasion when instead of returning to captain campbell he went back to the camp and waiting on the lieutenant governor and judge advocate asserted that he had put captain campbell in possession of the mine who had dispatched him over land for another officer and a proper guard his account not being doubted he was well fed and treated and lieutenant paulden with a guard and all necessary articles was ordered to attend him to the place but before they could set out to the great astonishment of all captain campbell arrived and unravelled the whole of this extraordinary deception this produced an unexpected revolution instead of receiving a reward for his golden discoveries the impostor was immediately taken into custody with two others supposed to be concerned in carrying on the artifice the next day he was examined with great privacy and strictness but no satisfactory elucidation being obtained from him he was ordered to be severely whipped subsequently to this punishment of which he was prepared to expect a weekly repetition between the intervals of hard labor and to be loaded incessantly with heavy irons during the time of his remaining in the colony he most audaciously persisted in endeavoring to maintain the delusion and declared that if an officer was sent with him he would show him the mine adding that he was heartily sorry for what had happened accordingly he was suffered to accompany lieutenant g johnston the governors adjutant of orders to the place in question before the boat had reached its destination mr johnston argued with him yet not without protesting that if he either attempted to deceive him as he had imposed upon captain campbell or presumed to move five yards from him and his party he would instantly order him to be shot finding that this officer was not to be trifled with but seemed determined he acknowledged that it was unnecessary to proceed any farther that he was ignorant of the existence of any such mine and that the specimens shown by him were only a composition of brass and gold which he had filed down and melted mr johnston brought him back when he was again examined and ordered to be punished it is needless to add that no further discovery was made he is now at liberty he is however obliged to wear a large r on his back the man whose name is daily appears insane yet others cannot be persuaded that he is a lunatic but are rather of opinion that he is a designing miscreant and that time will disclose a deeplaid scheme which he had planned for some purpose hitherto undiscovered for my own part i freely confess that i cannot coincide with their sentiments he was so artful as to circulate a report that he had sold several pounds weight of the ore to the master of the golden grove and some of his seamen this rumor was received with such credulity that in consequence of the impression which it made none of the sailors were suffered to leave the ship after a certain hour in the evening in a word so many ridiculous circumstances attended this affair that to attempt a complete enumeration of them would prove not less difficult than uninteresting    th the supply arrived from norfolk island after a long and rough passage she had landed but neither in apparent safety nor with facility the stores which she carried to that place and upon the present occasion i am sorry to add that the hazard of landing and embarking from this little island is so very great that mr cunningham a midshipman of the sirius who resided on it with lieutenant king the superintendant was lost with three seamen in a boat that was swamped by the surf which on every part of the coast runs high and beats against the shore with great violence so that i much fear from the difficulty of access and its situation it never will prove of any great consequence although it promised some advantages particularly in furnishing us with pine trees which grow here to a size nearly equal to those of norway in the whole island there is not a harbor capable of admitting even so small a vessel as the supply and the anchorage on every part of the coast is equally bad  the island produces a kind of gladiolus luteus or iris palustris of which as may be seen by the specimens sent mr wilson exceeding good hemp is to be made and which is to be procured in any quantity the plants growing in great abundance throughout the whole island the foregoing articles were the island larger and more easy of access with even a tolerable harbor might in any other country be of the first consequence to a maritime nation but from every information which i have gained from the officers and crew of the supply the procuring of this beneficial acquisition is at present somewhat doubtful the people settled upon it when they can venture out get great plenty of fish and at certain seasons turtle in the island also are pigeons as tame as domestic fowls and the soil seems well adapted for the growth of all kinds of grain and vegetables it produces a wild banana or plantain tree which by cultivation may assist the settlers as a succedaneum for bread and i am not without hopes that we shall be able to make some additions from thence to such necessaries of life as may in time be produced here  a few days since the natives landed near the hospital where some goats belonging to the supply were browsing when they killed with their spear a kid and carried it away within this fortnight they have also killed a hegoat of the governors whenever an opportunity offered they have seldom failed to destroy whatever stock they could seize upon unobserved they have been equally ready to attack the convicts on every occasion which presented itself and some of them have become victims to these savages i have already observed that they stand much in fear of a musket and therefore they very seldom approach any person by whom it is carried and their apprehensions are almost equally great when they perceive a red garment    october  d his majestys ship the sirius sailed for the cape of good hope for a supply of flour it being discovered that our stock of this article bore no proportion to the salt beef and pork  the same day the golden grove sailed for norfolk island with a reinforcement of male and female convicts two free men as gardeners a midshipman from the sirius to fill up the vacancy occasioned by the death of mr cunningham a sergeant corporal and six privates and a supply of necessaries for eighteen months   th a convict named cooper handley who went out with an armed party of marines to collect wild vegetables and sweet tea strayed from them and was afterward met by the natives who murdered and mutilated him in a shocking manner the natives were so near our men that they heard them very distinctly shouting and making a great noise yet were unable to overtake them in the pursuit in the evening a party of soldiers and convicts were sent out to bury the deceased   0th a general court martial was convened by warrant from the governor when the members with the deputy judge advocate were assembled they gave it as their opinion that notwithstanding the governor has full power and authority to grant and hold court martials among regular troops yet as a corpse of marines under the influence of a particular code of laws and instructions from the admiralty and only amenable to that board they could not proceed to trial the board of admiralty not having delegated any part of their authority over the marine corpse particularly that of holding court martials to the governor neither did any part of the act of parliament for forming a colony in new south wales contain directions relative to that subject the marine instructions with respect to court martials state that no general court martial can be ordered but by the lord high admiral or three commissioners for executing the office nor any sentence be carried into execution until approved of by him or them unless the marines as in america should be by act of parliament considered as a part of the army which is not the case here they are truly and literally governed and regulated by the same rules and instructions as the marine divisions at chatham portsmouth or plymouth and consequently their proceeding to trial would not only be illegal but a direct insult to the governance and power of the board under which they act and to whom every appeal from them must come unless an act of parliament in that case made and provided otherwise directs    th a marine went to gather some greens and herbs but has not returned as he was unarmed it is feared that he has been met and murdered by the natives    st a sergeant and four privates who had been missing three days returned they were sent by the commanding officer to look for the marine and lost themselves in the woods in the evening of this day we had very loud thunder and a shower of hail many of the hailstones were measured and found to be fiveeights of an inch in diameter  november  d this day more hail the weather dark and gloomy with dreadful lightning the mercury during the whole of the

norfolk island with a few spars and some timber for the governor while she lay there she was obliged to cut her cable and stand to sea there being as before observed no harbor in the whole island where a ship can ride in safety the master of the ship was swamped in the surf and nearly lost with his boat and crew    th thomas bulmore a private marine died in consequence of the blows which he received during a battle with one of his companions who is to be tried for his life on the   th instant by a criminal court so small is our number and so necessary is every individual who composes it for one purpose or another that the loss of even a single man may truly be considered as an irreparable disadvantage  the preceding is all the account i am able at present to send you of the territories of new south wales and its productions the unsettled state in which you must naturally suppose every thing as yet to remain will not permit me to be as copious as i could wish but by the next dispatch i hope to be able to send you no inconsiderable additions to the natural history and at the same time such further information concerning our affairs here as during the interim shall have occurred  appendix the banksia serrata in bud depiction of plant  natural history the different species of banksia the finest new genus hitherto found in new holland has been destined by linnoeus with great propriety to transmit to posterity the name of sir joseph banks who first discovered it in his celebrated voyage round the world it is indeed one of the most magnificent genera with which we are acquainted being nearly allied to protea and embothrium in habit and botanical characters but sufficiently distinguished from both by its fruit four species of banksia are described in the supplementum plantarum of linnoeus specimens of which we have seen in his herbarium now in thepossession of dr smith of marlborough street and we have deposited with the same gentleman specimens of all the plants we are about to describe in this work dr gaertner in his admirable book on fruits and seeds has figured the fruit of several banksias some of them described by linnaeus having had his plates with the names engraved before he saw the supplementum of linnaeus his nomenclature differs from that of the last mentioned author but he quotes his synonyms in the letter press we mention this that he may not be accused of wantonly changing linnaean names and that for the worse as it would appear to any one uninformed of this circumstance  the character of the genus is very badly made out in linnaeus gaertner has greatly corrected it but it is still a doubt whether the flowers are constantly monopetalous or tetrapetalous nor have we materials sufficient to remove this difficulty all we can say is that banksia is next in natural arrangement to protea from which it is essentially distinguished by having an hard woody bivalve capsule containing two winged seeds with a moveable membranous partition between them it is strangely misplaced in murrays   th edition of systema vegetabilium being put between ludwigia and oldenlandia  mr white has sent imperfect specimens and seeds of the banksia serrata in flower depiction of plant the banksia serrata in fruit depiction of plant four species of banksia which we have endeavored to settle as follows   b serrata linn supp     b conchifera gaertn     t      this is the most stately of the genus its trunk is thick and rugged leaves alternate standing thick about the ends of the branches on short footstalks narrow obtuse strongly serrated smooth and of a bright green color above beneath opaque and whitish with a strong rib running through their middle a very large cylindrical spike of flowers terminates each branch most of the flowers are abortive a few only in each spike producing ripe seed the form of the capsules may be understood from the figure which represents a whole spike in fruit about half the natural size the capsules are covered with thick down another plate of the plant in flower shows the curved position in which the style is held by the corolla the increase of the former in length being greater and more rapid than that of the latter    b pyriformis gaertn   0 t    f    this species was unknown to linnaeus and as gaertner has given no specific character of it we beg leave to offer the following  b floribus solitariis capsulis ovatis pubescentibus foliis lanceolatis integerrimis glabris  banksia with solitary flowers ovate downy capsules and lanceshaped entire smooth leaves  the capsules are larger than in any other known species in the figure they are represented somewhat smaller than the life but the seed is given as large as life    b gibbosa b dactyloides gaertn     t    f    b floribus solitariis capsulis ovatis gibbosis rugosis foliis teretibus  banksia with solitary flowers ovate tumid rugged capsules and cylindrical leaves  we suspect this to be the banksia dactyloides of gaertner but if so his figure is by no means a good one as he is generally very accurate we are rather inclined to believe the banksia pyriformis depiction of plant the banksia   the banksia gibbosa depiction of plant ours a different plant and have therefore given it a new name the leaves are very peculiar being perfectly cylindrical about two inches long and one line in diameter pale green and smooth the flowers we have not seen  fig   of the same plate represents the capsule of another banksia belonging to those which bear the flowers in spikes but we cannot with certainty determine the species the capfules are smooth at least when ripe and a little shining we think this is neither the b serrata integrifolia nor dentata of linnaeus nor probably his ericifolia so that it seems to be a species hitherto undescribed the leaves and flowers we have not seen  the peppermint tree eucalyptus piperita an eucalyptus obliqua lheritier sert angl p    see plate annexed  this tree grows to the height of more than an hundred feet and is above thirty feet in circumference the bark is very smooth like that of the poplar the younger branches are long and slender angulated near the top but as they grow older the angles disappear their bark is smooth and of a reddish brown the leaves are alternate lanceolate pointed very entire smooth on both sides and remarkably unequal or oblique at their base the veins alternate and not very conspicuous the whole surface of both sides of the leaves is marked with numerous minute resinous spots in which the essential oil resides the footstalks are about half an inch in length round on the under side angular above quite smooth the flowers we have not seen what mr white has sent as the ripe capsules of this tree although not attached to the specimens of the leaves grow in clusters from six to eight in each sessile the peppermint tree depiction of plant and conglomerated these clusters are supported on angular alternate footstalks which form a kind of panicle each capsule is about the size of an hawthorn berry globular but as it were cut off at the top rugged on the outside hard and woody and of a dark brown color at the top is a large orifice which shows the internal part of the capsule divided into four cells and having a square column in the center from which the partitions of the cell arise these partitions extend to the rim of the capsule and terminate in four small projections which look like the teeth of a calyx the seeds are numerous small and angular  the name of peppermint tree has been given to this plant by mr white on account of the very great resemblance between the essential oil drawn from its leaves and that obtained from the peppermint mentha piperita which grows in england this oil was found by mr white to be much more efficacious in removing all cholicky complaints than that of the english peppermint which he attributes to its being less pungent and more aromatic a quart of the oil has been sent by him to mr wilson  the tree above described appears to be undoubtedly of the same genus with that cultivated in some greenhouses in england which mr lheritier has described in his sertum anglicum by the name of eucalyptus obliqua though it is commonly called in the gardens metrosideros obliqua but we dare not assert it to be the same species nor can this point be determined till the flowers and every part of both be seen and compared we have compared the best specimens we could procure of each and find no specific difference the eucalyptus obliqua has when dried an aromatic flavor somewhat similar to our plant we have remarked indeed innumerable minute white spots besides the resinous ones on both surfaces of the leaves in some specimens of the garden plant which are not to be seen in ours and the branches of the former are rough with small scaly tubercles but how far these are constant we cannot tell the obliquity in the leaves one side being shorter at the base than the other as well as somewhat narrower all the way up as in the begonia nitida of the hortus kewensis is remarkable in both plants  the figure represents a branch of the peppermint tree in leaf on one side of it part of a leaf separate bearing the gall of some insect on the other the fruit above described  tea tree of new south wales melaleuca trinervia this is a small shrub very much branched the bark full of longitudinal fissures and easily separated from the branches leaves on short footstalks alternate lanceolate pointed entire about three quarters of an inch in length smooth on both sides marked with three longitudinal ribs and reticulated with transverse veins they are also full of resinous spots the seat of an aromatic essential oil the flowers we have not seen nor can we determine with certainty the genus of this plant it most nearly approaches the leptospermum virgatum of forster referred by the younger linnaeus perhaps improperly to melaleuca at least it may safely be determined to belong to the same genus with the melaleuca virgata linn supp though a distinct species the specific difference between them is that the leaves of our plant have three ribs whereas m virgata has leaves perfectly destitute of ribs or veins hence we judge the figure and description of rumphius herb amboin v   t    to belong rather to our tea tree than to m virgata and if this conjecture be right the plants are still further distinguished by the inflorescence which in m virgata is an umbel whereas in the figure above mentioned the flowers are solitary  a represents a leaf slightly magnified  sweet tea plant smilax glyciphylla this is a tree or shrub whose leaves only we have seen but from them we judge it to belong to the genus of smilax for want of the stem we cannot settle its specific character these leaves are about two inches long ovatolanceolate pointed entire marked with three longitudinal ribs and many transverse elevated veins smooth and shining above glaucous beneath with a thick cartilaginous edge of the substance of the ribs the leaves have the taste of liquorice root accompanied with bitter they are said to make a kind of tea not unpleasant to the taste and good for the scurvy the plant promises much in the last respect from its bitter as a tonic as well as the quantity of saccharine matter it contains  leaves of this plant are represented on the same plate with the tea tree a is the front b the back of a leaf  the tea tree of new south wales depiction of plant  bark of the red gum tree depiction of bark the red gum tree eucalyptus resinifera floribus pedunculatis calyptra conica acuta  see plate annexed  this is a very large and losty tree much exceeding the english oak in size the wood is extremely brittle and from the large quantity of resinous gum which it contains is of little use but for firewood of the leaves mr white has given no account nor sent any specimens the flowers grow in little clusters or rather umbels about ten in each and every flower has a proper partial footstalk about a quarter of an inch in length besides the general one the general footstalk is remarkably compressed anceps and the partial ones are so in some degree we have perceived nothing like bracteae or floral leaves the flowers appear to be yellowish and are of a very singular structure the calyx is hemispherical perfectly entire in the margin and afterward becomes the capsule on the top of the calyx rather within the margin stands a conical pointed calyptra of the same color with the calyx and about as long as that and the footstalk taken together this calyptra which is the essential mark of the genus and differs from that of the eucalyptus obliqua of lheritier only in being conical and acute instead of hemispherical is perfectly entire and never splits or divides though it is analogous to the corolla of other plants when it is removed we perceive a great number of red stamina standing in a conical mass which before the calyptra was taken off were completely covered by it and filled its inside the antherae are small and red in the center of these stamina is a single style or pointal rising a little above them and terminated by a blunt stigma the stamina are very resinous and aromatic they are inserted into the margin of the calyx so that the genus is properly placed by mr lheritier in the class icosandria these stamina and style being removed and the germen cut across about the middle of the calyx it appears to be divided into three cells and no more as far as we have examined each containing the rudiments of one or more seeds for the number cannot with certainty be determined whether the calyptra in this species falls off as in that described by mr lheritier or be permanent we cannot tell from one specimen sent by mr white the latter should seem to be the case and that the calyx swells and rises around it nearly to the top making a pearshaped fruit with the point of the calyptra sticking out at its apex but as this appears only in a single flower and none of the others are at all advanced toward ripening seed the flower in question may possibly be in a morbid state owing to the attacks of some insect  see fig g future observations will determine this point we have been the more diffuse in our description on account of the singularity of the genus and the value of the plant  on making incisions in the trunk of this tree large quantities of red resinous juice are obtained sometimes even more than sixty gallons from a single tree when this juice is dried it becomes a very powerfully astringent gumresin of a red color much resembling that known in the shops by the name of kino and for all medical purposes fully as efficacious mr white administered it to a great number of patients in the dysentery which prevailed much soon after the landing of the convicts and in no one instance found it to fail this gumresin dissolves almost entirely in spirit of wine to which it gives a blood red tincture water dissolves about one sixth part only and the watery solution is of a bright red both these solutions are powerfully astringent  the plate represents a

pistillum f calyptra separate g the enlarged flower which we suspect to be in a diseased state the yellow resin tree this is about the size of an english walnut tree its trunk grows pretty straight for about fourteen or sixteen feet after which it branches out into long spiral leaves which hang down on all sides and resemble those of the larger kinds of grass or sedge from the center of the head of leaves arises a single footstalk eighteen or twenty feet in height perfectly straight and erect very much resembling the sugar cane and terminating in a spike of a spiral form not unlike an ear of wheat this large stem or footstalk is used by the natives for making spears and fish gigs being pointed with the teeth of fish or other animals some of which are represented in the plate of implements from originals now in mr wilsons possession  but the most valuable produce of this plant seems to be its resin the properties of which vie with those of the most fragrant balsams this resin exudes spontaneously from the trunk the more readily if incisions are made in its bark it is of a yellow color fluid at first but being inspissated in the sun it acquires a solid form burnt on hot coals it emits a smell very much resembling that of a mixture of balsam of tolu and benzoin somewhat approaching to storax it is perfectly soluble in spirit of wine but not in water nor even in essential oil of turpentine unless it be digested in a strong heat the varnish which it makes with either is very weak and of little use with respect to its medicinal qualities mr white has found it in many cases a good pectoral medicine and very balsamic it is not obtainable in so great abundance as the red gum produced by the eucalyptus resinifera  the plant which produces the yellow gum seems to be perfectly unknown to botanists but mr white has communicated no specimens by which its genus or even class could be determined  the crested cockatoo depiction of bird  the crested cockatoo psittacus cristatus lin i cannot regard this bird in any other view than as a variety of the psittacus cristatus of linnaeus or large white cockatoo which has been described by almost all ornithologists and figured in several works of natural history the bird seems liable to great variation both as to size and color the white in some being of a much purer appearance than in others and the yellow on the crest and tail more predominant all the varieties yet known agree in having the beak and legs blackish the individual specimen here figured seemed of a somewhat slenderer form than usual the color not a pure white but slightly tinged on the upper parts and particularly on the neck and shoulders with dusky the feathers on the front white but the long lanceolate feathers below them which form the crest of a pale jonquilyellow the tail white above and pale yellow beneath as are also the wings  the white fulica fulica alra fullea alba rostro fronteque rubris humeris spinosts pedibus flavis  corpus magnitudine sere gallinae domesticae humeri spina parva in curvata  in specimine exsiccato pedes flavi sed fortasse in viva ave rostro concolores  white fulica with the bill and front red shoulders spined legs and feet yellow  the body is about the size of a domestic fowl the shoulders are furnished with a small crooked spine in the dried specimen the legs and feet are yellow but perhaps in the living bird might have been of the same color with the beak  this bird is the only species of its genus yet known of a white color the birds of this genus rank in the order called by linnaeus grallae and most of the species frequent watery places to this genus belongs the wellknown bird called the moorhen or fulica chloropus as also a very beautiful exotic species called the purple waterhen which is the fulica porphyrio of linnaeus and which in shape much resembles the white fulica now described  the white fulica depiction of bird  the southern motacilla depiction of bird  the southern motacilla motacilla australis m cinera subtus flava  n b gula fere albida  ashcolored motacilla yellow beneath  n b the throat inclines a little to whitish  it is not perhaps absolutely clear whether this bird should be referred to the genus motacilla or muscicapa the probability however is in favor of motacilla  the bird is about the size of the motacilla flava of linnaeus or yellow wagtail but seems of a stouter make the beak is of a pale color and the legs brown the two middle tailfeathers have the very extremities slightly marked with white  the genus motacilla is extremely numerous and it is not easy to fix upon a proper or expressive trivial name such names should if possible convey some idea either of the color or some other circumstance relative to the manners or habits of the animal but in new species whose history is unknown this is impracticable the trivial name therefore of australis may be allowable though it cannot be regarded as sufficiently distinctive  wattled beeeater or merops female the female beaeater is stouter in the body and in the legs more brilliant in the plumage the bill more curved and the tail cuneated and tipped with white but shorter than in the male the feathers on the head are small each tipped with white and somewhat erected it has no wattles but on the chin the feathers are dark long and hang diffusely  the general color of the bird is a blackish chocolate lighter on the breast and toward the vent darker on the abdomen and toward the tip of the tail the feathers on the neck and breast have each a streak of white through the middle on the wing the outer long feathers are slightly edged with whitish those of the middle region roundended and tipped only and on the upper part of the wing each feather bears a streakd own the middle suddenly dilating at the tip  the legs yellower than those of the male claws blackish  the crested goatsucker depiction of bird  the crested goatsucker caprimulgus cristatus c cinereofuscus

the long feathers of the wings and tail sprinkled with numerous pale fasciae and the vibrissae or bristles on the upper mandible standing up on each side in the manner of a crest  the body on the upper part is sprinkled with very small whitish specks  the birds of this genus are remarkable for the excessive wideness of the mouth though the beak is very small in their manner of life as well as general structure they are very nearly allied to the genus hirundo or swallow and indeed may be regarded as a kind of nocturnal swallows they feed on insects particularly on beetles the name caprimulgus or goatsucker was given to this genus from an idea that prevailed amongst the more ancient naturalists of their sometimes sucking the teats of goats and sheep a circumstance in itself so wildly improbable that it would scarce deserve to be seriously mentioned were it not that so accurate a naturalist as the late celebrated scopoli seems in some degree to have given credit to it  the scincoid or skingformed lizard lacerta scincoides this lizard comes nearer to the scineus than any i am acquainted with but is still a distinct species  in the two specimens sent over by mr white one had a process on the upper part of the tail near the top almost like a supernumerary or forked tail but which i rather conceive to be natural and as this one was a male i am inclined to think that this is peculiar to that sex which would in some degree have been more clearly made out if the other which had not this process had proved a female but as its being gutted and stuffed before i saw it prevented my examination this remains still to be proved but what makes the conjecture very probable is that it is mentioned by mr white that some are without and some with this process now if it was a monster arising either from accident or originally so formed it would hardly be so common as to be taken notice of the tail is longer than that of the scincuses and not so taper the animal is of a dark irongrey color which is of different shades in different parts forming a kind of stripes across the back and tail the shineformed lizard   eggs   the egg as broken   the young the scales of the cuticle are strong but not so much so as those of the scincus its legs are short and strong covered with the same kind of scales as the body but the scales of the feet are not on the cuticle are small knobs as if it were studded  the toes on each foot are pretty regular the difference in length not great and the same on both the fore and hind foot which is not the case with the sincus it having a long middle toe  there are small short nails on each toe on their upper surface they are covered with a series of scales which go half round like a coat of mail  just within the verge of the external opening of the ear on the anterior edge is a membrane covering about one third of it which is scolloped on its loose or unattached edge this can hardly be called an external ear nor can it be called the reserve viz a valve but if it is an assistant to hearing which it most probably is it should be considered as the external ear  the teeth are in a row on each side of each jaw becoming gradually larger backwards they are short above the gum and rounded off fitted for breaking or bruising of substances more than cutting or tearing  the muricated lizard lacerta muricata l cauda tereti longa

white disposed longitudinally throughout the whole upper part of the body except that on the tail the bands are not carried much above the base the remainder being of a pale ferruginous color in some specimens a tinge of this color is also visible on the back the lower part of the body is of a yellowish white the tail is perfectly round of a great length and gradually tapers to the extremity  the broadtailed lizard lacerta platura l cauda depressoplana lanceolata margin subaculeato corpore griseofusco scabro  ungues quasi duplicati lingua brevis lata integra seu non forficata apice autem leniter emarginato  l with a depressed lanceolate tail almost spiny on the margin the body of a dusky gray color and rough  the claws appear as if double the tongue is short and broad not forked but slightly emarginated at the tip  this lizard is strikingly distinguished by the uncommon form of its tail which is of a depressed or flattened shape with very thin edges and gradually tapers to a sharp extremity this depressed form of the tail is extremely rare in lizards there being scarcely more than two other species yet known in which a similar structure takes place one of these is the l caudiverbera of linnaeus in which the tail appears to be not only depressed but pinnated on the sides another species with a depressed tail has been figured by the count de cepede in his history of oviparous quadrupeds  the present species is about four inches and a half in length the head is large in proportion and the whole upper surface of the animal is beset with small tubercles which in some parts especially toward the back of the head and about the tail are lengthened into a sharpened point the lower surface is of a pale color or nearly white  the blue frog rana caerulea r caerulea

to come from the root of the yellow gum tree and is a congeries of scales cemented as it were together by the gum whether they are the bases of the leaves of that tree or part of a parasitical plant growing upon it future observations must determine the latter supposition seems to be countenanced by the appearance of fibrous roots at the base of this singular production  the white hawk falco albus falcoalbus rostro nigro cera pedibusque flavis  white hawk with black beak cere and legs yellow  this species in shape and general appearance seems very nearly allied to the bird called in england the henharrier which is the falco cyaneus of linnaeus it is very nearly of the same size and the legs and thighs are of a slender form as in that species  the whole plumage is white whithout any variegation  the white hawke   the white vented crow depiction of bird  the whitevented crow corvus graculinus corvus niger remigum rectricumque basi apiceque caudoe albis  black crow with the

white base of the wing feathers gives the appearance of a white spot when the wings are closed the beak is very strong the upper mandible slightly emarginated near the tip and the lower mandible is of a pale color toward the tip the capistrum reversum or set of bristles which are situated forward on the base of the upper mandible in most of the birds of this genus is not very conspicuous in this species but the whole habit and general appearance of the bird sufficiently justify its being regarded as a species of corvus  fuliginous peteril procellaria fuliginosa procellaria fuliginosa rostro

about    inches in length and the tail is considerably longer the animal is of a black color variegated with yellow marks and streaks of different shapes and running in a transverse direction on the legs are rows of transverse round spots and on the tail broad alternate bars of black and yellow in some specimens the yellow was much paler than in others and nearly whitish  the longspined chaetodon

specimens of them in spirits which arrived in england in a very perfect state there was no person to whom these could be given with so much propriety as mr hunter he perhaps being most capable of examining accurately their structure and making out their place in the scale of animals and it is to him that we are indebted for the following observations upon them in which the anatomical structure is purposely avoided as being little calculated for the generality of readers of a work of this kind  it is much to be wished that those gentlemen who are desirous of obliging their friends and promoting the study of natural history by sending home specimens would endeavor to procure all the information they can relating to such specimens as they may collect more especially animals the subjects themselves may be valuable and may partly explain their connection with those related to them so as in some measure to establish their place in nature but they cannot do it entirely they only give us the form and construction but leave us in other respects to conjecture many of them requiring further observations relative to their economy a neglect in procuring this information has left us almost to this day very ignorant of that part of the natural history of animals which is the most interesting the opossum is a remarkable instance of this there is something in the mode of propagation in this animal that deviates from all others and although known in some degree to be extraordinary yet it has never been attempted where opportunity offered to complete the investigation i have often endeavored to breed them in england i have bought a great many and my friends have assisted me by bringing them or sending them alive yet never could get them to breed and although possessed of a great many facts respecting them i do not believe my information is sufficient to complete the system of propagation in this class in collecting animals even the name given by the natives if possible should be known for a name to a naturalist should mean nothing but that to which it is annexed having no allusion to any thing else for when it has it divides the idea this observation applies particularly to the animals which have come from new holland they are upon the whole like no other that we yet know of but as they have parts in some respect similar to others names will naturally be given to them expressive of those similarities which has already taken place for instance one is called the kangaroo rat but which should not be called either kangaroo or rat i have therefore adopted such names as can only be appropriated to each particular animal conveying no other idea  animals admit of being divided into great classes but will not so distinctly admit of subdivision without interfering with each other thus the class called quadruped is so well marked that even the whole is justly placed in the same class birds the same amphibia as they are called the same and so of fish etc but when we are subdividing these great classes into their different tribes genera and species then we find a mixture of properties some species of one tribe partaking of similar properties with a species of another tribe  of the kangaroo this animal probably from its size was the principal one taken notice of in this island the only parts at first brought home were some skins and sculls and i was favored with one of the sculls from sir joseph banks as the teeth of such animals as are already known in some degree point out their digestive organs i was in hopes that i might have been able to form an opinion of the particular tribe of the animals already known to which the kangaroo should belong but the teeth did not accord with those of any one class of animals i was acquainted with therefore i was obliged to wait with patience till i could get the whole and in many of its other organs the deviation from other animals is not less than in its teeth in its mode of propagation it very probably comes nearer to the opossum than any other animal although it is not at all similar to it in other respects its hair is of a greyish brown color similar to that of the wild rabbit of great britain is thick and long when the animal is old but it is a kangaroo depiction of kangaroo late in growing and when only begun to grow it is like a strong down however in some parts it begins earlier than others as about the mouth etc in all of the young kangaroos yet brought home although some as large as a full grown cat they have all the marks of a foetus no hair ears lapped close over the head no marks on the feet of having been used in progressive motion the large nail on the great toe sharp at the point and the sides of the mouth united something like the eyelids of a puppy just whelped having only a passage at the anterior part this union of the two lips on the sides is of a particular structure it wears off as it grows up and by the time it is of the size of a small rabbit disappears  of the tooth of the kangaroo the teeth of this animal are so singular that it is impossible from them to say what tribe it is of there is a faint mixture in them corresponding to those of different tribes of animals  take the mouth at large respecting the situation of the teeth it would class in some degree with the scalpris dentata this tribe includes the rat etc in a fainter degree with the horse and ruminants and with regard to the line of direction of all the teeth they are very like those of the scalpris dentata the fore teeth in the upper jaw agree with the hog and those in the lower in number with the scalpris dentata but with regard to position and probably use with the hog the grinders would seem to be a mixture of hog and ruminants the enamel on their external and grinding surfaces rather formed into several cutting edges than points there are six incisors in the upper jaw and only two in the lower but these two are so placed as to oppose those of the upper five grinders in each side of each jaw the most anterior of which is small the proportions of some of the parts of this animal bear no analogy to what is common in most others the disproportions in the length between the fore legs and the hind are very considerable also in their strength yet perhaps not more than in the jerboa this disproportion between the fore legs and the hind is principally in the more adult for in the very young about the size of a half grown rat they are pretty well proportioned which shows that at the early period of life they do not use progressive motion the proportions of the different parts of which the hind legs are composed are very different the thigh of the kangaroo is extremely short and the leg is very long the hind foot is uncommonly long on which to appearance are placed three toes the middle toe by much the largest and the strongest and looks something like the long toe of an ostrich the outer toe is next in size and what appears to be the inner toe is two enclosed in one skin or covering  the great toe nail much resembles that of an ostrich as also the nail of the outer toe and the inner which appears to be but one toe has two small nails which are bent and sharp  from the heel along the under side of the foot and toe the skin is adapted for walking upon  the fore legs in the full grown kangaroo are small in proportion to the hind or the size of the animal the feet or hands are also small the skin on the palm is different from that on the back of the hand and fingers there are five toes or fingers on this foot the middle rather the largest the others become very gradually shorter and are all nearly of the same shape the nails are sharp fit for holding the tail is long in the old but not so long in proportion to the size of the animal in the young it would seem to keep pace with the growth of the hind legs which are the instruments of progressive motion in this animal and which would also show that the tail is a kind of second instrument in this action  the under lip is divided in the middle each side rounded off at the division  it has two clavicles but they are short so that the shoulders are not thrown out  whitejointed spider depiction of spider  white jointed spider the species of spiders unless seen recent and in the utmost state of perfection are not easily distinguished the present species is most remarkable for the lucid surface of its thorax and legs which latter are furnished with several long moveable spines that may be either elevated or depressed at the will of the animal this however is not peculiar to the present species but is seen in some others the eyes are eight in number and are arranged in the same manner as those of the great american spider or aranea avicularia of linnaeus the color of this spider is a clear chestnut brown except the body which is a pale brown with a very deep or blackish fascia on its upper part reaching about half way down the orifice at the tip of each fang is very visible by so slight a magnifying power as that of a glass of two inches focus this spider is therefore of the number of those which poison their prey before they destroy it  the plate exhibits the back and front view of the natural size a the order in which the spines are placed the lesser a two spines enlarged showing the bracket on which they turn and the groove or niche they shut into when closed c the fangs magnified  wha tapoau roo this animal is about the size of a racoon is of a dark gray color on the back becoming rather lighter on the sides

the ears broad not peaked  the teeth resemble those of all the animals from that country i have hitherto seen  the incisors are not continued into the grinders by intermediate teeth although there are two teeth in the intermediate space in the upper jaw and one in the lower the incisors are similar to those of the kangaroo and six in number in the upper jaw opposed by two in the lower which have an oblique surface extending some distance from their edge so as to increase the surface of contact  there are two cuspidati on each side in the upper jaw and only one in the lower five grinders on each side of each wha tapoau roo jaw the first rather pointed the others appear nearly of the same size and quadrangular in their shape with a hollow running across their base from the outside to the inner which is of some depth and another which crosses it but not so deep dividing the grinding surface into four points  on the fore foot there are five toes the inner the shortest resembling in a slight degree a thumb the hind foot resembles a hand or that of the monkey and opossum the great toe having no nail and opposing the whole sole of the foot which is bare the nails on the other toes both of the fore and hind foot resemble in a small degree those of the cat being broad and covered and the last bone of the toe has a projection on the under side at the articulation each nail has in some degree a small sheath covering its base when drawn up  the tail is long covered with long hair except the under surface of that half toward the termination of the breadth of half an inch becoming broader near the tip or termination this surface is covered with a strong cuticle and is adapted for laying hold  a dingo or dog of new south wales this animal is a variety of the dog and like the shepherds dog in most countries approaches near to the original of the species which is the wolf but is not so large and does not stand so high on its legs  the ears are short and erect the tail rather bushy the hair which is of a reddish dun color is long and thick but strait it is capable of barking although not so readily as the european dogs is very illnatured and vicious and snarls howls and moans like dogs in common  whether this is the only dog in new south wales and whether they have it in a wild state is not mentioned but i should be inclined to believe they had no other in which case it will constitute the wolf of that country and that which is domesticated is only the wild dog tamed without having yet produced a variety as in some parts of america  dog of new south wales   a tapoa tafa   the tapoa tafa or tapha this animal is the size of a rat and has very much the appearance of the martin cat but hardly so long in the body in proportion to its size  the head is flat forwards and broad from side to side especially between the eyes and ears the nose is peaked and projecting beyond the teeth which makes the upper jaw appear to be considerably longer than the lower the eyes are pretty large the ears broad especially at their base not becoming regularly narrower to a point nor with a very smooth edge and having a small process on the concave or inner surface near to the base it has long whiskers from the sides of the cheeks which begin forwards near the nose by small and short hairs and become longer and stronger as they approach the eyes it has very much the hair of a rat to which it is similar in color but near to the setting on of the tail it is of a lighter brown forming a broad ring round it the fore feet are shorter than the hind but much in the same proportion as those of the rat the hind feet are more flexible there are five toes on the fore feet the middle the largest falling off on each side nearly equally but the fore or inner toe is rather shortest they are thin from side to side the nails are pretty broad laterally and thin at their base not very long but sharp the animal walks on its whole palm on which there is no hair the hind feet are pretty long and have five toes that which answers to our great toe is very short and has no nail the next is the longest in the whole falling gradually off to the outer toe the shape of the hind toes is the same as in the fore feet as are likewise the nails it walks nearly on the whole foot the tail is long and covered with long hair but not all of the same color  the teeth of this creature are different from any other animal yet known the mouth is full of teeth the lower jaw narrow in comparison to the upper more especially backwards which allows of much broader grinders in this jaw than in the lower and which occasions the grinders in the upper jaw to project considerably over those in the lower in the middle the cuspidati oppose one another the upper piercers or holders go behind those of the lower the second class of incisors in the lower jaw overtop those of the upper while the two first in the lower go within or behind those of the upper in the upper jaw before the holders there are four teeth on each side three of which are pointed the point standing on the inner surface and the two in front are longer stand more obliquely forwards and appear to be appropriated for a particular use the holders are a little way behind the last fore teeth to allow those of the lower jaw to come between they are pretty long the cuspidati on each side become longer and larger toward the grinders they are points or cones placed on a broad base  there are four grinders on each side the middle two the largest the last the least their base is a triangle of the scalenus kind or having one angle obtuse and two acute their base is composed of two surfaces an inner and an outer divided by processes or points it is the inner that the grinders of the lower jaw oppose when the mouth is regularly shut the lower jaw has three fore teeth or incisors on each side the first considerably the largest projecting obliquely forwards the other two of the same kind but smaller the last the smallest  the holder in this jaw is not so large as in the upper jaw and close to the incisors there are three cuspidati the middle one the largest the last the least these are cones standing on their base but not on the middle rather on the anterior side there are four grinders the two middle the largest and rather quadrangular each of which has a high point or cone on the outer edge with a smaller and three more diminutive on the inner edge it is impossible to say critically what the various forms of these teeth are adapted for from the general principles of teeth in the front we have what may divide and tear off behind those there are holders or destroyers behind the latter such as will assist in mashing as the grinders of the lion and other carniverous animals and last of all grinders to divide parts into smaller portions as in the graminiverous tribe the articulation of the jaw in some degree admits of all those motions  the tapoa tafa   the tapoa tafa another animal of the same species only differing from the tapoa tafa in its external color and in being spotted  the poto roo of kangaroo rat the head is flat sideways but not so much so as the true scalpris dentata the ears are neither long nor short but much like those of a mouse in proportion to the size of the animal  the fore legs are short in comparison to the hind there are four toes on the fore feet the two middle are long and nearly of equal lengths with long narrow nails slightly bent the two side toes are short and nearly equal in size but the outer rather the largest from the nails on the two middle toes one would suppose that the animal burrowed their hind legs are long and it is in their power to stand either on the whole foot or on the toes only  on the hind legs are three toes the middle one large and the two side ones short the tail is long the hair on the body is rather thin it is of two kinds a fur and a long hair which last becomes exterior from its length the fur is the finest and is composed of serpentine hairs the long hair is stronger and is also serpentine for more than two a poto roo thirds of its length near to the skin and terminates in a pretty strong pointed end like the quill of a hedge hog it is of a brownish gray color something like the brown or gray rabbit with a tinge of a greenish yellow  it has a pouch on the lower part of the belly the mouth opens forwards and the cavity extends backwards to the pubis where it terminates on the abdominal surface of this pouch are four nipples or two pair each pair placed very near the other  the hepoona roo this animal is of the size of a small rabbit it has a broad flat body the head a good deal resembles that of the squirrel the eyes are full prominent and large the ears broad and thin its legs short and its tail very long between the fore and hind legs on each side is placed a doubling of the skin of the side which when the legs are extended laterally is as it were pulled out forming a broad lateral wing or fin and when the legs are made use of in walking this skin by its elasticity is drawn close to the side of the animal and forms a kind of ridge on which the hair has a peculiar appearance in this respect it is very similar to the flying squirrel of america  it has five toes on each fore foot with sharp nails the hind foot has also five toes but differs considerably from the fore foot one of the toes may be called a thumb having a broad nail something like that of the monkey or opossum what answers to the fore and middle toes are united in one common covering and appear like one toe hepoona roo with two nails this is somewhat similar to the kangaroo the two other toes are in the common form these four nails are sharp like those on the fore foot this formation of the foot is well calculated for holding any thing while it is moving its body or its fore foot to other parts a property belonging probably to all animals who move from the hind parts such as the monkey mocock mongoose opossum parrot leech etc  its hair is very thick and long making a very fine fur especially on the back it is of a dark brown gray on the upper part a light white gray on the lower side of what may be termed the wing and white on the under surface from the neck to the parts adjacent to the anus  feather of the cassowary the feathers of the new holland cassowary are of a remarkable construction and may perhaps be more easily delineated than described the specimen is figured of the exact size and consists of two long slender shafts extremely flaccid issuing from one small quill the feather at the base of each shaft is closely set soft and flossy widening and growing harder gradually to the tip resembling the texture of a dried plant  the color brownish ash whitening toward the quill  it seems incapable of resisting water or of holding air this circumstance in the feather added to the great pliability of the shaft is a most admirable provision for a bird whose safety is entrusted solely to its feet  fish hooks of new so wales  feather of the cassowary    fish hooks of new south wales fig a represents a hook of the same size formed of a hard black woodlike substance neatly executed and finished with a small knob to assist in fastening it to the line it is well mounted the line consists of two strands very evenly laid and twisted hard made with a grassy substance dark in color and nearly as fine as raw silk the length of it is shown by the top of the rod being broken off  fig b is a hook of mother of pearl formed by an internal volute of some spiral shell assisted by grinding it a little on one side only the point of this hook as well as of the former seems to an european to turn so much as to render them almost useless  implements of new south wales aa is a war spear formed of a light reedlike substance produced by the yellow gum tree vide p     which if the ends marked with the letters were joined together would show its full length the long pointed head is of hard wood of a reddish color and is fastened into the shaft in the firmest manner by a cement of the yellow gum only  b is a stick at one end of which is a small peg fastened with the same cement and forming a hook the other end is ornamented with the shell of the limpet or patella stuck on with the gum and thus constructed it is used to throw the spear  in this manner the shell end of the stick being held in the right hand and the spear poised in the left the end of the hook at b is inserted into a hollow at the foot of the spear at d and thus thrown with a force similar to that of a stone from a sling this is shown more particularly in a reduced figure at the upper part of the plate a b  cc is a spear or gig of a substance similar to the former for striking fish in the water the true length of which will be implements of new south wales known by supposing the parts joined together at the lettered ends the shaft consists of two pieces a large and a small one joined by the gum and the head is composed of four sticks inserted into the shaft with gum and tied together above with slips of bark which are afterward tightened by little wedges driven within the bandage each of these sticks is terminated by the tooth of a fish very sharp and stuck on by a lump of the gum cement the shaft of this instrument is punctured in many places with very small holes to the pith in the center but for what purpose is not known  h is a hatchet of which the head is a very hard black pebble stone rubbed down at one end to an edge the handle is a stick of elastic wood split which being bent round the middle of the stone and the extremities brought together is strongly bound with slips of bark and holds the head very firmly as smiths chissels are held by hazel sticks in europe  s is a kind of blunt sword of hard wood like the head of the spear a  f seems to be an instrument of offense it is a stick of the natural growth with the bark on the root of which is cut round into a large knob the end f is made rough with notches that it may be held more firmly in the hand  r is a basket formed by a single piece of a brown fibrous bark this separated whole from the tree is gathered up at each end in folds and bound in that form by withes which also make the handle the basket is patched in several places with yellow gum from which it appears to have been sometimes used for carrying water  these implements are drawn from exact measurements and fitted to a scale of three feet inserted at the foot of the plate  flyingfish exocaetus volitans this fish is so well known to naturalists and is so frequently seen in every voyage that it is unnecessary to give a particular description of it see plate page      seahorse or hippocampus this

esquire and an account of expenses incurred in transporting convicts to new south wales  london printed for j debrett opposite burlingtonhouse piccadilly  mdccxci  extracts of letters etc etc extract of a letter from governor phillip to the right honorable lord sydney dated sydney cove   th february    0 when the supply left norfolk island the people were all very healthy and they had vegetables in the greatest abundance they get fish when the weather permits to the boat to go without the reef and at times in such quantities that fish is served to the people in lieu of salt provisions they make their lines from the flax plant but unfortunately we have not any person who understands how to dress it  half a pod of cotton being found on the island supposed to be brought there by a bird and a cocoanut which was perfectly sound and appeared to have been but a short time in the water being thrown upon the beach have given some reason to suppose that both these articles will be found in some island at no great distance  lord how island has been examined but no fresh water or good anchorage being found it can be of no other advantage to this settlement than occasionally supplying a few turtle  i had the honor of informing your lordship that a settlement was intended to be made at a place i named rose hill  at the head of this harbor there is a creek which at half flood has water for large boats to go three miles up and one mile higher the water is fresh and the soil good a very industrious man who i brought from england is employed there at present and has under his direction one hundred convicts who are employed in clearing and cultivating the ground a barn granary and other necessary buildings are erected and twentyseven acres in corn promise a good crop the soil is good and the country for twenty miles to the westward which is as far as i have examined lays well for cultivation but even there the labor of clearing the ground is very great and i have seen none that can be cultivated without cutting down the timber except some few particular spots which from their situation laying at a distance from either of the harbors can be of no advantage to us at present and i presume the meadows mentioned in captain cooks voyage were seen from the high grounds about botany bay and from whence they appear well to the eye but when examined are found to be marshes the draining of which would be a work of time and not to be attempted by the first settlers  the captains guard which until lately did duty at rose hill is now reduced to a lieutenant and twelve privates and intended merely as a guard to the store which contains the provisions and which is in the redoubt for i am now sensible there is nothing to be apprehended from the natives and the little attention which had been desired of the officers more than what was immediately garrison duty when at rose hill is now no longer required  at sydney cove all the officers are in good huts and the men in barracks and although many unforeseen difficulties have been met with i believe there is not an individual from the governor to the private soldier whose situation is not more eligible at this time than he had any reason to expect it could be in the course of the three years station and it is the same with the convicts and those who have been any ways industrious have vegetables in plenty the buildings now carrying on are of brick and stone the house intended for myself was to consist of only three rooms but having a good foundation has been enlarged contains six rooms and is so well built that i presume it will stand for a great number of years  the stores have been lately overrun with rats and they are equally numerous in the gardens where they do considerable damage and as the loss in the stores could only be known by removing all the provisions that was ordered to be done and many casks of flour and rice were found to be damaged or totally destroyed the loss in those two articles by the rats since landing has been more than twelve thousand weight  vegetables and provisions having been frequently stolen in the night from convicts and others twelve convicts were chosen as a night watch and they have actually answered the end proposed no robbery having been committed for several months and the convicts in general have lately behaved better than i ever expected only two convicts have suffered death in the last year  four were executed the first year  as near two years have now passed since we first landed in this country some judgment may be formed of the climate and i believe a finer or more healthy climate is not to be found in any part of the world of one thousand and thirty people who were landed many of whom were worn out by old age the scurvy and various disorders only seventytwo have died in one andtwenty months and by the surgeons returns it appears that twentysix of those died from disorders of long standing and which it is more than probable would have carried them off much sooner in england fiftynine children have been born in the above time  in december the corn at rose hill was got in the corn was exceeding good about two hundred bushels of wheat and sixty of barley with a small quantity of flax indian corn and oats all which is preserved for seed  here i beg leave to observe to your lordship that if settlers are sent out and the convicts divided amongst them this settlement will very shortly maintain itself but without which this country cannot be cultivated to any advantage at present i have only one person who has about a hundred convicts under his direction who is employed in cultivating the ground for the public benefit and he has returned the quantity of corn above mentioned into the public store the officers have not raised sufficient to support the little stock they have some ground i have had in cultivation will return about forty bushels of wheat into store so that the produce of the labor of the convicts employed in cultivation has been very short of what might have been expected and which i take the liberty of pointing out to your lordship in this place to show as fully as possible the state of this colony and the necessity of the convicts being employed by those who have an interest in their labor the giving convicts to the officers has been hitherto necessary but it is attended with many inconveniences for which the advantages arising to the officers do not make amends it will not therefore be continued after this detachment is relieved unless particularly directed the numbers employed in cultivation will of course be increased as the necessary buildings are finished but which will be a work of time for the numbers in this settlement who do nothing toward their own support exceed those employed for the public  in november the supply sailed for norfolk island with some convicts and returned after being absent six weeks all the people in that island were well and their crops after all they had suffered from rats birds and a worm which had done them considerable damage so good that they had grain sufficient for six months bread for every one upon the island reserving sufficient for their next years crops  early in january    0 the supply again sailed for norfolk island with more convicts and in her passage left a small party on lord how island to turn turtle but in fifteen days only three were taken so that no great advantages will at present accrue from thence the island has fresh water but no good anchoring ground  since the deaths mentioned in a former part of this letter one woman has suffered for a robbery five children have died and twentyeight children have been born making in all seventyseven deaths and eightyseven births  extract of a letter from governor phillip to the right honorable lord sydney dated sydney cove   th of february    0 in order to get a knowledge of the country round this settlement frequent excursions have been made since the ships sailed in november      soon after which i went to botany bay and the five days spent in that harbor confirmed me in the opinion i had first formed of it  that it afforded no eligible situation for fixing the settlement and was a bad harbor not affording good security for ships against the easterly winds which frequently blow very hard in the winter and which has been further proved by captain hunter and the first lieutenant of the sirius when there to survey the bay  after having been several times with the boats to broken bay in order to examine the different branches in that harbor a river was found but the want of provisions obliged us to return without being able to trace it to its source which has since been done and in the sixteen days we were then out all those branches which had any depth of water were traced as far as the boats could proceed  the breadth of this river named the hawkesbury is from  00 to  00 feet and it appears from the soundings we had to be navigable for the largest merchant ships to the foot of richmond hill but as the water near the head of the river sometimes rises after very heavy rains thirty feet above its common level it would not be safe for ships to go so far up but fifteen or twenty miles below richmond hill they would lay in fresh water and perfectly safe i speak of richmond hill as being the head of the river it there growing very shallow and dividing into two branches  the high rocky country which forms broken bay is lost as you proceed up the hawkesbury and the banks of the river are there covered with timber the soil a rich light mould and judging from the little we saw of the country i should suppose it good land to a very considerable extent the other branches of fresh water are shoal but probably run many miles further into the country than we could trace them with our boats on these rivers we saw great numbers of wild ducks and some black swans and on the banks of the hawkesbury several decoys made by the natives for to catch the quail  richmond hill near the foot of which a fall of water prevented our proceeding further with the boats is the southern extremity of a range of hills which running to the northward most probably join the mountains which lay nearly parallel to the coast from fifty to sixty miles inland the soil of richmond hill is good and it lays well for cultivation our prospect from the hill was very extensive to the southward and eastward the country appearing from the height at which we were to be a level covered with timber there is a flat of six or seven miles between richmond hill and a break in the mountains which separates landsdowne and carmarthen hills and in this flat i suppose the hawkesbury continues its course but which could not be seen for the timber that with very few exceptions covers the country wherever the soil is good  the great advantages of so noble a river when a settlement can be made on its banks will be obvious to your lordship  the settlement made at port jackson near the head of the harbor rose hill very fully answers my expectations  the soil is exceeding good lays well for cultivation and is well watered six miles to the southward there is a small fresh water river and twenty miles to the westward there is a more considerable river the source of which i suppose to be at the foot of the mountains the banks of this river which most probably empties itself into the hawkesbury are high the soil a good light mould and covered with trees the wood of some of those trees is very light they are about the size of large walnut trees which they resemble they shed their leaves and bear a small fruit which is said to be very wholesome this river likewise frequently rises thirty feet above its common level it is as far as i have seen it from  00 to  00 feet in breadth i named it the nepean and its source will be traced in the course of the winter and from its banks i hope to reach the mountains which has been attempted by a party who crossed the river but after the first days journey they met with such a constant succession of deep ravines the sides of which were frequently inaccessible that they returned not having been able to proceed above fifteen miles in five days when they turned back they supposed themselves to be twelve mile sfrom the foot of the mountains  as the land for several miles to the southward and twenty miles to the westward of rose hill that is to the banks of the nepean is as fine land for tillage as most in england some few particular spots excepted the soil of which is poor but bears a very small proportion to the good land i propose that tract of land for those settlers which may be sent out and though they will be placed at some distance from each other for the convenience of water from one to three or four miles they will have nothing to apprehend from the natives who avoid those parts we most frequent and always retire at the sight of two or three people who are armed  as the labor of clearing the ground of timber will be great i think each settler should not have less than twenty men on his farm which i suppose to be from five hundred to one thousand acres it will be necessary to give that number of convicts to those settlers who come out and to support them for two years from the public stores in that time if they are any ways industrious they will be in a situation to support themselves and i do not think they will be able to do it in less time at the expiration of the two years they may return half the convicts they have been allowed and would want no further assistance from government  it may be necessary to grant lands to officers and soldiers who becoming settlers will of course be entitled to every indulgence but few of the officers now here have reaped any great advantage from being allowed convicts and it is attended with unavoidable inconvenience from those convicts being left so much to themselves and from their mixing with the soldiers it may be found more to the advantage of the crown and the officers likewise if officers on duty in this settlement were allowed a certain quantity of grain to support their live stock until they have a market to go to and i make no doubt but that in the third year from the time settlers arrive there will be a market well supplied with grain poultry hogs and goats of all which there has been a great increase but killed from wanting corn to support them and the natives so frequently setting fire to the country which they do to catch the opossum flying squirrel and other animals has prevented swine from being turned out as was intended  if this plan of distributing amongst the settlers those convicts who are not immediately necessary for carrying on the public works is approved of and which i propose as appearing to me the most likely to render this settlement independent for the necessaries of life in the shortest time possible there are many regulations which will of course take place  extracts of a letter from governor phillip to lord sydney dated government house sydney cove april   th    0 the quantity of flour brought from the cape of good hope by the sirius was less than i expected  four months flour only for the settlement and a years provisions for the ships company and it was necessary to give the ship a very considerable repair before she could be sent to sea again which was not completed before the middle of january when i had reason to expect ships from england in the course of a few weeks the sending to the islands would have answered as far as procuring live stock to breed from but which was not immediately wanted and what the sirius could have brought for the consumption of such a number of people would have been but a very small relief how island has been tried several times and only a few turtle procured  the goodness of the soil on norfolk island and the industry of those employed there rendered that island a resource and the only one that offered when from the time which had passed since my letters might be supposed to have been received in england there was reason to suppose some accident had happened to the store ships sent out  i therefore ordered two companies of marines to be ready to embark with a number of convicts by the  th of march if no ship arrived before that time and a proportion of what provisions and stores remained in this settlement being put on board the sirius and supply sixtyfive officers and men with five women and children from the detachment and civil department one hundred and sixteen male and sixtyseven female convicts with twentyseven children embarked and sailed the  th of march  the advantage i expected by sending away such a number of people was from the little garden ground they would leave and which would also assist those who remained and the fish which might be caught in the winter would go the further at the same time those sent to norfold island would have resources in the great abundance of vegetables raised there and in fish and birds which this settlement could not afford them and it was my intention to have sent more convicts to that island if there had not been this necessity  the provisions sent with what was on the island and the wheat and indian corn raised there more than would be necessary for seed was calculated to last full as long as the provisions in this place and at norfolk island from the richness of the soil a man may support himself with little assistance from the store after the timber is cleared away  as i wished to send an officer to england who could give such information as cannot be conveyed by letters and the detachment was now divided i replaced the officer who was superintendant and commandant at norfolk island by major ross the officer i have recalled having been two years on the island is very capable of pointing out the advantages which may be expected from it and i think it promises to answer very fully the end proposed by making the settlement it will be a place of security for the convicts where they will soon support themselves and where they may be advantageously employed in cultivating the flax plant  extracts from instructions given by governor phillip to the lieutenant governor during his command at norfolk island dated  d march    0 you will cause the convicts to be employed in the cultivation of the land in such manner as shall appear to you the best calculated to render that settlement independent as far as respects the necessaries of life paying such attention to the cultivation of the flax plant as your situation will admit of and which is to be the principal object when the necessaries of life are secured to the settlers  as from the great increase of corn and other vegetable food which may be expected from a common industry and in so fertile a soil after a certain quantity of ground is cleared and in cultivation as well as from the natural increase of swine and other animals it cannot be expedient that all the convicts should be employed in attending only to the object of provisions you are to cause the greatest possible number of these people to be employed in cultivating and dressing the flax plant as a means of acquiring clothing for themselves and others persons who may become settlers as well as for a variety of maritime purposes and for which its superior excellence renders it a desirable object in europe  you will at every opportunity transmit to me all such remarks or observations as you may make respecting the nature of the soil on the island and point out such means as may appear to you the most likely to answer the views of government in the cultivation of the flax plant and in rendering that island independent for the necessaries of life and for the order and government of the settlers thereon that such information may from me be transmitted to his majestys ministers  description of norfolk island norfolk island is situated in the latitude    00 and in the longitude of     00 east its form is nearly an oblong and contains from twelve to fourteen thousand acres  the face of the country is hilly and some of the valleys are tolerably large for the size of the island many of the hills are very steep and some few so very perpendicular that they cannot be cultivated but where such situations are they will do very well for fuel on the tops of the hill are some extensive flats  mount pit is the only remarkable high hill in the island and is about one hundred and fifty fathoms high the clifts which surround the island are about forty fathoms high and perpendicular the basis of the island is a hard firm clay the whole island is covered with a thick wood choked up with underwood  the island is well supplied with many streams of very fine water many of which are sufficiently large to turn any number of mills these springs are full of very large eels  from the coast to the summit of mount pit is a continuation of the richest and deepest soil in the world which varies from a rich black mould to a fat red earth we have dug down forty feet and found the same soil the air is very wholesome and the climate may be called a very healthy one there has been no sickness since i first landed on the island  there are five kinds of trees on the island which are good timber viz the pine live oak a yellow wood a hard black wood and a wood not unlike the english beech the pine trees are of a great size many of which are from   0 to   0 feet in height and from six to nine feet in diameter those trees which are from  00 to   0 feet in height are in general sound from the root to the lower branches there is from  0 to  0 feet of sound timber the rest is too hard and knotty for use it sometimes happens that after cutting off twenty feet from the butt it becomes rotten or shakey for which reason no dependence can be put in it for large masts or yards the timber of the pine is very useful in buildings and is plentiful along the coast its dispersed situation in the interior parts of the island is well calculated for erecting such buildings as may be necessary from what i have seen of this wood i think it is very durable two boats have been built of it and have answered the purpose fully  the live oak yellow wood black wood and beech are all of a close grain and are a durable wood  the flax plant of new zealand grows spontaneously in many parts of the island but mostly abounds on the sea coast where there is a very great quantity of it the leaves of which the flax is made is when full grown six feet long and six inches wide each plant contains seven of those leaves a strong woody stalk rises from the center which bears the flowers it seeds annually and the old leaves are forced out by young ones every year every method has been tried to work it but i much fear that until a native of new zealand can be carried to norfolk island that the method of dressing that valuable commodity will not be known and could that be obtained i have no doubt but norfolk island would very soon cloth the inhabitants of new south wales  there are a great quantity of pigeons parrots hawks and other smaller birds which are now in a wild state  the ground is much infested with different kinds of the grub worm which are very destructive to the growth of vegetables they are mostly troublesome about the spring it is to be hoped that when more ground is cleared away that this evil will cease  there is no quadrupede on the island except the rat which is much smaller than the norway rat these vermin were very troublesome when first we landed but at present there are but very few  the coasts of the island abound with very fine fish no opportunities were ever lost of sending the boat out which enabled us to make a saving of two pounds of meat each man a week  the coasts of the island are in general steep too and excepting at sydney anson ball and cascade bays they are inaccessible being surrounded by steep perpendicular clifts rising from the sea some rocks are scattered about close to the shore  sydney bay on the south side of the island is where the settlement is made landing at this place entirely depends on the wind and the weather i have seen as good landing as in the thames for a fortnight or three weeks together and i have often seen it impracticable to land for ten or twelve days successively but it is much oftener good landing than bad  anson bay is a small bay with a sandy beach where landing is in general good with an offshore wind and moderate weather but as the interior parts of the island are so difficult of access from thence no ships boats have ever landed there  ball bay is on the southeast side of the island the beach is a large loose stone when landing is bad in sydney bay it is very good here as it also is in cascade bay on the north side of the island  during the winter months viz from april to august the general winds are the south and southwest with heavy gales at times in the summer the southeast wind blows almost constant  the spring is visible in august but the native trees and many plants in the island are in a constant state of flowering the summer is warm and sometimes the droughts are very great all the grain and european plants seeded in december from february to august may be called the rainy reason not that i think there is any stated times for rains in these months as it is sometimes very fine weather for a fortnight together but when the rain does fall it is in torrents i do not remember above three claps of thunder during the time i was on the island the winter is very pleasant and it never freezes  the proper time for sowing wheat and barley is from may to august and is got in in december that which has been sowed has produced twentyfive fold and i think the increase may be greater two bushels of barley sowed in      produced twentyfour bushels of a sound full grain  the indian corn produces well and is in my opinion the best grain to cultivate in any quantity on account of the little trouble attending its growth and manufacturing for eating  the rio janeiro sugar cane grows very well and is thriving  vines and oranges are very thriving of the former there will be a great quantity in a few years  potatoes thrive remarkably well and yield a very great increase i think two crops a year of that article may be got with great ease  every kind of garden vegetable thrives well and comes to great perfection  the quantity of ground cleared and in cultivation belonging to the public was on the   th march    0 from twentyeight to thirtytwo acres and about eighteen cleared by free people and convicts for their gardens  philip gidley king london january  0th      an account of the
