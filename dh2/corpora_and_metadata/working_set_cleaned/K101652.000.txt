friendship and old age in the name of the lady who translated them how may i gibbon to thy taste confide this artless copy of a gallic gem will thou not cast the unpolished work aside and with just scorn my failing line condemn no thou will never with pedantic phlegm spurn the first produce of a female mind young flowers that trembling on a tender stem court thy protection from each ruder wind

wish to wake no more song i enjoy my child the balmy sleep which over thy form new beauties throws and long thy tranquil spirit keep a stranger to thy mothers woes though in distress i feel it less while gazing on thy sweet repose ii condemned to pangs like inward fire that through my injured bosom roll how would my heart in death desire relief from fortunes hard control did not thy arms and infant charms to earth enchain my anxious soul iii flow fast my tears  by you relieved i vent my anguish thus unknown but cease ere ye can be perceived by this dear child to pity prone whose tender

roman eagles near and feeling more respect than fear thus with united love and awe invites him to his shed of straw though he is but a twittering sparrow the fields he hops in rather narrow when nobler plumes attract his view he ever pays them homage due and looks with reverential wonder on him whose talons bear the thunder nor could the jackdaws ever inveigle his voice to vilify the eagle though issuing from those holy towers in which they build their warmest bowers their sovereigns haunt they slily search in hopes to find him on his perch for pindar says beside his god the thunderbearing bird will nod then peeping round his still retreat they pick from underneath his feet some molted feather he lets fall and swear he cannot fly at all  lord of the sky whose pounce can tear these croakers that infest the air trust him the sparrow loves to sing the praise of thy imperial wing he thinks thou wilt deem him on his word an honest though familiar bird and hopes thou soon wilt condescend to look upon thy little friend that he may boast around his grove a visit from the bird of jove to mr mason on his sending the author his translation of dufresnoy with notes by sir joshua reynolds      i dear brother of the tuneful art to whom i justly bend i prize with a fraternal heart the pleasing gift you send ii with pride by envy undebasd my english spirit views how far your elegance of taste improves a gallie muse iii i thought that muse but meanly dressed when her stiff gown was latin but you have turned her grogram vest into fine folds of satin iv mild reynolds looks with liberal favor on your adopted girl and to the graceful robe you gave her adds rich festoons of pearl impromptu to mr meyer on his sending the author from the continent two prints representing the coronation of voltaire and rousseaus arrival in elysium      i the song that shakes the festive roof when mirth and musics liveliest notes ascend is not more pleasing than the proof of kind remembrance from an absent friend ii then guess the pleasure that we share and thus dear meyer accept the thanks we owe while we behold the crowned voltaire and see elysium hail our loved rousseau iii may all the honor all the joy known by each genius in thy gift portrayd be thine without the dull alloy that tinged their golden days with dusky shade iv as lively as the gay voltaire with his keen pen may thy fine pencil strive may thou as long delight the fair and triumph like the bard at eightyfive v as tender as the warm rousseau like him thy happier thought on nature fix but

country is cursed and wisely conclude that playwritings the worst now serve to the public this olio complete and puff in the papers your delicate treat to miss seward on her being at eartham in the variable weather august      i whence are these storms  an angry poet cried who saw his shady summer haunts defaced saw over his shattered grove black whirwinds ride and loud lamented this untimely waste ii he spoke and aeolus upreard his head half his huge form round which dark clouds were driven rising from oceans broad and billowy bed filled up the vast expanse from earth to heaven iii as his fierce eye surveyed the rough profound from the stern god the voice of anger broke air earth and sea reverberate the sound and shrinking nature shudderd as he spoke iv know thou vain bard within thy mansion dwells the wondrous source of all this wild uproar thence round my cave the din of discord swells and i my rebel offspring rule no more v to own my laws my madning sons refuse all all are deaf to my paternal power struggling alike to kiss that vagrant muse who deigns to visit thy sequestered bower vi rough boreas used in these still months to sleep starts from his cell in passions wild alarms while dripping auster rushes from the deep to snatch the fairone from his brothers arms vii each others fond ambition to destroy alike they struggle merciless as death see my young zephyr natures tender joy encounters eurus with contentious breath viii cease my rash sons this cruel war to wage though tempting beauty gave your conflict birth lest famine wakened by your frantic rage stalk in fell triumph over the blasted earth ix see shivering mortals mourn the inverted year while ceres weeps her golden pride deprest if ye no longer natures law revere yet mildly listen to your sires request  x let each in order taste the tempting bliss for which these mutual wounds ye vainly bear each unmolested take one precious kiss and freely clasp this phrenzykindling fair xi he paused  black boreas eldest of his race whose stormy passion the chill maiden shocks binds her reluctant in his strong embrace and sports licentious in her auburn locks xii eurus succeeds of less disgusting mien yet mad the trembling fairone to assail beneath his pressure more intensely keen the wounded ruby of her lip grows pale xiii next with mild charms and less tumultuous love by melting auster see the nymph carest he with the softness of the murmuring dove waves his moist pinions over her softer breast xiv now lively zephyr the sweet muse is thine o long embrace her in our laughing skies and round her bid this joyous landscape shine rich as her verse and radiant as her eyes content written at the request of a lady for the vase at batheaston      how idle are mortals said wisdom to youth they slight the clear dictates of reason and truth they worship ambition to pleasure they bend yet blindly oerlook a more excellent friend and hence their vain hopes are eternally crossed their life in a tempest of wishes is lost still destined to toil and of toil to repent for neglect of just vows to the goddess content that goddess from whom all felicity flows who unites every good in the gift she bestows so free of her bounty to all who confess it to solicit her smile is almost to possess it when i heard this fine speech my fond passion was raised and i set forth in quest of the being so praised at the mansion of grandeur my search i begin and ask if the goddess content is within but pride who as sentinel guarded the door said bluntly he never heard her title before he told me i wanted a poor rustic slut and bade me go look in some little thatched hut i marched to the villagers lowly abode twas a snug pretty cottage and stood near the road and here a good woman possessing though humble a face that could frown and a tongue that would grumble said  the person i asked for had lodged in her cot but alas such good luck was no longer her lot for she quitted her roof where she often had reposed when you great house was built and the common enclosed i conceived as i now bade the village farewell with the mild sons of science this goddess must dwell but those where i sought some obliging instructor were squabbling about an electric conductor some cried up the point some commended the ball the soft breath of science was turned to a squall the sages no mental conductor could find to draw off the flame that now flashed on their mind in haste i exclaimed to the learned adieu for even science offends when she talks like a shrew having wandered so wide of the object i sought i was now led to think and rejoiced at the thought this goddess herself for her charms so renowned with the daughters of beauty must surely be found with this hope i approached unperceived by them all three lovely young girls just arrayed for the ball in each whose bright eyes on a mirror were bent i thought i discovered a spark of content but watching them more in their beautiful faces of the goddess i sought i no more saw the traces for as they surveyed with a critical glance the elegant montagu move in the dance in her exquisite figure such graces were shown that viewing her charms they distrusted their own thou gentlest of nymphs while thy triumphs increase unconscious of beauty so fatal to peace though the sparks of content in one sex thou may smother bright ecstasys flame thou will raise in the other if in bosom parental content could reside the heart of thy parent this treasure must hide but alas it is a truth which all parents lament their tender anxiety stifles content o tell me while vainly to find thee i pant dear latent divinity where is thy haunt away to batheaston goodnature replies behold she there weaves the poetical prize with thy myrtle kind miller o let me be crowned then my search is repaid and the goddess is found nay if to another your wreath you assign and give it to verse far superior to mine my searchs dear object i still must attain and the proof of this wonders exceedingly plain it rests on this maxim by horace invented the bard who writes worst is the bard most contented my claim to this blessing thus made very clear if i have nothing to hope i have nothing to fear for miller can please while the mind she amuses both when she bestows and even when she refuses in truth i suspect from her singular aim the goddess i seek is concealed by her name she herself is content and her house is the fane where spleen and ill nature no favors obtain some mortals in vain for admission must pray but all who once enter go smiling away end
