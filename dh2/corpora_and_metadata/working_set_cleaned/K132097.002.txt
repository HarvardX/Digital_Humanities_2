appearance is against them in a series of letters in three volumes by the author of emily herbert or perfidy punished  vol ii  london nted for thomas jones at his circulating library bridgestreet westminster  m dcc lxxxvi  appearance is against them letter the twentieth miss westbury to lady bell sidney london thank heaven i begin to breath again my dear lady bell for upon my honor it is more than i can say i have done freely for some time so great has been my anxiety and most painful suspense my brother is at length pronounced out of danger yet so weak and low that it is judged necessary he should drink the bristol waters we therefore propose setting off for that place next tuesday i shall accompany him as i think duty demands it of me  though i am very sorry to say i have already discovered his sentiments on a certain subject continue as inveterate as ever he has in spite of the unremitted and let me say the kind attention i have shown him during his confinement had the cruelty to express the most rooted aversion to the man on whom he knows my happiness depends  this horrid this unjust prejudice is really unpardonable and puts it out of my power to feel for his sufferings as i otherwise should  however it is some consolation to reflect that he cannot prevent my felicity though he has so long retarded it and it is certainly very disagreeable to hear the most deserving the most amiable of men thus abused for so i may with too much reason term the language he makes use of when talking of him i am exceedingly hurt at this moment as you will easily guess when informed of the cause  i was sitting by him not an hour since when my woman brought me your letter  he fixed his eyes upon me while i read it and observing the pleasure it seemed to give me cried though so weak he could scarcely raise his voice without pain  caroline tell me truly is that letter from that d  nd fellow rochley by heavens if i thought you dreamt of having any further connection with such a beggarly  stop sir john said i shocked beyond endurance at his expressions i will not patiently hear a person i blush not to confess i have the highest esteem for thus vilified  ask your heart sir whether he ever gave you just cause to  cause replied he see the condition to which i am reduced madam and then ask your ownheart the question  ah sir john sir john does yours then acquit you fie brother  do not give me reason to blush for the sentiments of one whom i wish to respect  you are you must be conscious you have only yourself to blame for the situation you have been reduced to was he to sacrifice his life in order to spare that of a person he well knew wished to rob him of it in the basest and most atrocious manner  that of his greatest nay let me say his only enemy  i hoped sir john your reflections while languishing on a bed of sickness while every moment the sear of death was before your eyes would have taught you to see the nature of your sentiments in a proper light i am sorry they have not produced so desirable an effect  is that letter from him i say i want none of your ridiculous sermons  pardon me if i do not think myself bound to answer any question asked in so rude so unbrotherly a manner  yet that i may set you an example of that behavior you have too long been a stranger to  i will condescend to tell you it is not  thank you sister for your kindness only add to it by swearing you never will receive any from him and you shall find i not only can but will profit by it  excuse me sir however i may wish your reformation i cannot possibly pay so great a price for it  i now left him to cool at his leisure and took up my pen as the likeliest means to cool myself for i confess i was too much warmed by the curious dialogue i am determined if possible not to come to open war with him i wish not to change my place of abode to leave him i mean if i can any way avoid it my late fathers house is certainly the most eligible place i can inhabit while single  had he been still spared to me i should not have been subjected to the tyranny of this tormenting illtempered brother his reign is thank heaven pretty nearly expired that reflection enaables me to bear it with tolerable fortitude and the moment it is he may depend upon it i shall put myself under the protection of a more amiable lord and master  that is a point determinately fixed  i am not quite clear whether i shall make any long stay with him at bristol i certainly shall not if i find he is likely to receive benefit from it having seen him commodioufly settled there shall return home where i impatiently long to be that i may put my thoughts into some kind of train for they have really for some weeks past been in a state of confusion  adieu my dear lady bell  i will let you know where to direct to me next  your affectionate friend caroline westbury  letter the twentyfirst miss rochley to miss lenox london my orlando has been ill my dear harriot yes he has been ill and his isabella at a cruel distance from him he tells me he is nearly recovered but dare i flatter myself he does not deceive me now as he has kindly done all the time he has been confined  kindly the dear creatures intentions were i well know and yet i can hardly forgive the well meant desception since i now reproach myself for having been so cheerful while he was perhaps in danger  he tells me he would still have kept me a stranger to it could he have contrived any other reason to give me for his not returning immediately to england but assures me though not yet able to bear the fatigue of the journey he is out of all possible danger it seems he caught a fever from a gentleman who lodged in the same house with him who is now however perfectly well  this person is a most agreeable young man who is going on a tour to the south of france and has almost tempted my brother to accompany him if he should be prevailed upon it will detain him from me about two months longer and i rather think by what he says he will comply for i find he has got a farther leave of his absence from his worthy general who recommends the plan as it will not only serve to reestablish his health but also give him an opportunity of seeing that part of the world which is well worth his notice  all this convinces me the thing is resolved on yet i am persuaded were i to express a wish for his return he would indulge me but for this very reason i have pressed the contrary indeed i am of the generals opinion and were i not i love him too well not to prefer his satisfaction to my own at any time  sir john i hear left london last week and is in a fair way of recovery  that circumstance is so important that i should have been the happiest creature in the world had i not now a thousand apprehensions on my orlandos account however if his next letter informs me he is actually set out on his tour i shall be tolerably easy as that will be a proof that he is better  for that letter you may well believe i am impatient beyond expression  and now a word or two of my new neighbor  you will please to recollect it is near a fortnight since he came here i mention this lest you should wonder to find he has contrived to be introduced to me though lord templeton could not  see what it is for a man to be passed the age of gallantry they have many advantages  yet it is possible those who are not may not envy them  it seems mr douglas for that is my new friends name had heard me warbling to my harpsichord  of course asked mrs bellmour who it was to whom he was indebted for being so highly entertained as he politely termed it  to him she thought no reserve necessary but freely acquainted him with my situation  honestly owning to me she thought a man of his age a single man too and immensely rich might be a desirable friend this it seems was her kind motive for so fully gratifying his curiosity  she wished to tell him my real name too as he might possibly have known some of my family but would not presume to do it without my permission  i thanked her for her attention saying she had acted with her usual propriety that as to my name it was of little consequence since i had taken that of beverly i would even continue it till my brothers return  mrs bellmour it seems said so many fine things in my praise that the old gentlemen expressed a violent desire to see me that he might himself judge whether i deserved them  in short she begged me to honor her with my company at tea a few days after his arrival and there i met him not by surprise i should tell you for she had asked permission for that also  if he was charmed with me i do assure you i was no less so with him  how so delightful a man could so long continue a bachelor heaven knows  crossed in love i suppose harriot  not that he is so very very old neither i mention this lest if we should make a match of it and you should fancy him as old as the hills  he has seen a great deal of the world has a fine understanding great memory and of course is a most entertaining companion but music is his passion  not love  he is a great proficient on several instruments his taste is excellent and i am not without hopes mine will be much improved under his instruction for we are already come to that my dear  i have given him permission to pass an hour with me at any time when not better engaged which he as in duty bound politely says can never happen i now regret he is to make so short a stay in london  perhaps it may not be quite so short as mrs bellmour fancies i really shall be sorry when he leaves us as he makes my time pass more pleasantly than it did before  mrs bellmour who i believe is sincerely attached to me has often regreted that lord templeton had not an opportunity of being introduced to me as he bears so excellent a character and as she is certain i could not fail to be partial to him on a farther acquaintance she wants to ask mr douglas whether he knows him  i bid her have patience time is a worker of miracles  his lordship is certainly uncommonly handsome i tell her but it by no means follows i should prefer him to all others merely on that account this she allows but adds he is universally reckoned the most amiable and accomplished man in england and is certain we are formed for each other  if so i reply we shall certainly manage the business without interference  i find harriot his lordship has contrived to gain her good graces most completely and i believe she now wishes i would be a little less  i will not say prudent  but in short less reserved  she must however excuse me i cannot prevail upon myself to stoop to conquer a proper pride my dear is necessary to man and woman too  i am now going to sing my old friend a song who is this moment enquiring for me  adieu yours isabella rochley  letter the twentysecond same to the same london the plot begins to thicken as somebody says harriot  lord templeton has actually by some means got acquainted with my worthy friend mr douglas  it is absolutely a fact my dear here follows what passed between us this morning on the subject  i had been playing a lesson to mr douglas on the harpsichord and afterward at his desire sung  in love to pine and languish yet know my passion vain etc  i had no sooner finished then he smiling cried and can you my dear young lady give so much sweet expression to those lines yet be the cruel the hard hearted creature i am told you are  harriot i thought i should have expired with confusion  i expected the next moment to see him pop down on his knees at my feet  what else could i think after this speech but a passionate declaration of love  i now wished the instrument at jerusalem that had been the means of bringing me into such a scrape  he saw my embarrassment and i have not a doubt guessed my thoughts  pray said i at last who is the enemy who gives me a character i flatter myself i so little deserve  and have you then no idea who it can be replied he is your conscience my dear miss beverly quite at ease yes upon my word it is returned i gasping for breath  and your heart too both i assure you  why then cried he affecting to look wondrous grave poor lord templeton may as well put an end to his torments by tucking himself up on the first friendly willow he can meet with  lord templeton exclaimed i with amazement good heavens mr douglas what can you mean  oh ho cried he i have found you out my lovely young friend have i i thought i should bring you in guilty before i had done  upon my honor looking exceedingly silly i believe i never saw his lordship but once in my life he is absolutely a stranger to me  i know it miss beverly i know it and that is the very identical cause of those torments i was talking of and of which he so much complains  he too saw you once and strange to tell has been blind absolutely blind to the charms of every other woman from that moment  but how in the name of fortune came you sir to know all this supposing it true which i have not the vanity to think credible  why you must know madam this same unfortunate lord finding i suppose by some curious means or other that i was so happy as to be an inmate under the same roof with you has lately taken it into his head to be particularly charmed with the coffeehouse i use the next whim that struck his lordship was to be no less charmed with me  that you know was the most natural thing in life as he could not but discover i was the best companion imaginable by my very looks well we all at once grew wonderfully intimate i cannot say i am conscious of making any violent advances in order to obtain this honor it is not my way since a lord to me is pretty much upon a par with a commoner if i find their understandings upon a par also  i own i have some oddities about me miss beverly and that is one of them  some days after this friendship was struck up between us which to be sure tickled my vanity not a little  he begun to let it down gradually by convincing me i was not the only object of his attachment for he asked if i had ever een so fortunate as to see miss beverly who lived at mrs bellmours  oh ho thought i  i now begin to see the foundation on which our great friendship is built and a very pretty foundation it is  seen her my lord yes and heard her too and what is more have the vanity to imagine she does not behold me with indifference  not behold you with indifference sir cried his lordship in the finest agitation you can conceive  and pray my lord interrupting him is that so ve extraordinary am i then so  gusting an object if so  came your lordship to be so taken with me continued i with an expressive smile  he now seemed at a loss to know whether i was in jest or earnest which was exactly my intention  have you then really  sir cried he at last any serious thoughts of miss beverly  many very serious ones i give you my honor  and she does not behold you with indifference  i have reason to think she does not  then i am the most wretched of men exclaimed his lordship  hey day why pray my lord what has miss beverlys honoring me with her esteem to do with your happiness or misery  mr douglas said he i adore her  very well my lord i think you cannot give a greater proof of your judgment but this by no means explains to me why you are therefore to pronounce yourself the most wretched of men  ah sir have you not confessed to me the lovely creature does not behold you with indifference  why what an unconscionable being yo acknowledge yourself my lord granting you do adore her  nay granting she too adored you is  to look with an eye of indifferenc on every other mortal i estee her greatly and know her to be highly accomplished to possess an uncommonly fine understanding all this from personal knowledge i can justify  more in her favor were it necessary i have heard from one who is still better acquainted with her i have conceived a very sincere regard for her and i will add my lord were i twenty years younger i should be tempted to adore her too would you not after this reckon her an ungrateful gypsey were she to behold me with indifference  ah my dear sir my dear mr douglas taking my hand  yours miss beverly not being within his reach  can you forgive my petulance  i confess you alarmed me  greatly alarmed me  i feared  i was a rival said i interrupting him  i thank you for the compliment my lord it is a very flattering one but suppose i had been weak enough to entertain views of that nature i do not think it need have thrown your lordship into despair miss beverly has taste and discernment  he bowed  and now added i suppose we begin to understand each other you say you love this amiable girl to adoration if i mistake not and i have a very great friendship and esteem for her  thus stands the case what comes next  shall i be sincere cried he  o by all means my lord  then i will freely confess i hoped it might be possible through your kind interposition for me to be introduced to her i know you to be a man of honor and trust the world does me the justice to think me so  i have made every possible attempt to obtain that happiness but hitherto every effort has been ineffectual  miss beverly for proper reasons i make not a doubt lives retired i have not till i had the good fortune to meet with you been able to find any person of her acquaintance  mrs bellmour has been deaf to all my solicitations and miserable as it has made me i esteem her the more for it now my dear sir if you on a farther knowledge of my character can procure me this honor i shall look upon it as the greatest obligation you can possibly confer  my happiness my peace of mind depend upon your indulging me in my request  now miss beverly said mr douglas i have done  thus much this insinuating friend of mine prevailed upon me to promise i complied with less reluctance because i have to tell you the truth conceived a very good opinion of him though that alone would not have sufficed one may be deceived by appearances but i have made it my particular business to know his character from others and find it all i could wish  what can i say sir replied i his lordship certainly does me a great deal of honor but situated as i am at present i cannot according to my ideas of rectitude think of receiving his visits  i cannot indeed  you have my permission sir to tell him i think myself honored by his attention but till my brothers return must decline seeing him  nay nay if you go on at that rate i shall be in love with you myself and there will be an end of his lordships hopes at once  what  you pretend to tell me you have not sixpence in the world yet scruple to break through the forms of decorum at the hazard of losing the affection of a man who is dying to make you mistress of such a fortune as might amply gratify the ambition of any woman in england looke miss beverly do not thus tempt an old fellow to play the fool  i tell you i am determined to withstand all your allurements i will not fall in love with you that is positive so you may as well give up all hopes of it  is he not a delightful old man harriot i vow i could find in my heart to be sorry for the resolution he with so much humor says he has formed  i am to tell him then continued he you will nor permit me to introduce him  if you will do me that favor my dear sir i shall think myself infinitely obliged to you  it is more than his lordship will do however you shall be obeyed  and pray sir give him to understand i am not as he may perhaps fancy a woman offortune i wish not to deceive him this information may possibly prove as effectual a remedy as the lovers leap  i shall tell him no such thing for you know nothing of the matter how should you know what you are worth nay my dear sir  and nay my dear madam  i have lived longer in the world than you and could tell you a thousand stranger things than that  but adieu  i am going to the coffeehouse so saying he left me delighted with his agreeable manner but utterly at a loss to comprehend his last speech  mr douglas had no sooner left me than i sat down to give you these particulars  my mind is now more at ease so i hope will his lordships and that he will cease all farther importunity  i would not for worlds have admitted his visits situated as i at present am under a feigned name and my dear protector absent  ah i could not possibly think of it yet i will not deny that i am rather pleased to find he is so very serious in the business  should his mind prove as engaging as his person i shall have some cause to be vain of my conquest yet who can say when he has gained the point he seems so extremely solicitous about i mean when he is better acquainted with me that he has formed an idea which i shall by no means answer  depend upon it his imagination has given me more perfections than happen to fall to my share i do not mean by this to depreciate those i really do possess neither i have too much vanity not to have a tolerable opinion of them but a man so prodigiously in love as he would persuade me he is must fancy the object of it a goddess at least  farewell i am now mistress of a new subject for your amusement you see as well as for my own to say truth it is full time my epistles should be embellished by a dash of love  yours isabella rochley  letter the twentythird miss rochley to miss lenox london do you know harriot i have met with the greatest shock since my last that ever i received in my life or hope ever shall again i am still so fluttered by it though it happened yesterday that i can hardly guide my pen  it has absolutely affected my nerves  no never was so insolent so despicable a creature  i was sitting in my room yesterday morning enjoying a letter i had just received from my dear orlando who by the way is perfectly recovered and set off on the tour i mentioned when my door opened and without ceremony in flounced  guess who  only lady beningfield i rose from my seat at her entrance not at that instant recollecting her and was of course though surprised to see a stranger going to receive her politely but her behavior soon brought her to my remembrance and also accounted for the honor she did me seeing plainly she came with no friendly design i very composedly resumed my seat leaving her ladyship to find one for herself in case she chose to follow my example   this i saw piqued her most horridly fine airs miss you give yourself upon my word methinks you might treat a person of my rank and she bridled with a little more ceremony  had your rank been properly announced to me before you thought fit thus to intrude yourself into my apartment perhaps i should have paid more attention to it though your behavior would soon have destroyed any degree of respect that rank might have inspired  insolent but it is no wonder your silly head should be turned  she was so violently agitated that she could not proceed i on the contrary felt so much contempt for her that i was more composed then than i am now while giving you an account of it  pray madam may i presume to ask said i how i came to be honored with your very agreeable company i really have not the happiness of being in the least acquainted with you and consequently am rather at a loss  acquainted with me cried she with a sneer no really my acquaintance i would have you to know are in a very different line of life  and to make a little variety i presume madam you wish to add me to the number  do not attempt to be witty child i shall be sick of it  i should be sorry for that said i since your being ill might be a means to prolong your visit  dont be impertinent young woman that may be still worse suppose then and by this time harriot i had taken up a purse i am netting and began to work suppose then we wave all farther ceremony madam and come to the point  once more permit me to ask what has procured me the honor of this visit  why then without farther ceremony miss i should be glad to know what footing you are upon with lord templeton i am not to learn that he has taken some pains to make you believe a thousand most absurd and ridiculous things i have very particular reasons for making this enquiry you cannot surely be such a fool as to fancy he has any thoughts of marrying you  that is out of the question now had you been wise enough to have treated me with that deference i have a right to i meant to have made you a very friendly offer first however let me know what it is you really expect from him  allow me first said i with astonishing calmness to tell you madam what i expect from you rising and going to the door which is that you will be kind enough to find your way down stairs as you found the way up  i really thought the creature would have beat me harriot  how dare you cried she choking with rage presume to treat a person of my quality with this unheard of insolence  because returned i that feather quality on which you very justly set so high a value conscious you have nothing else to boast of i pay no sort of regard to when possessed by a being i have reason to look down upon with contempt  so saying i very quietly walked into the next room turned the key of the door lest she should think proper to follow me and left her to her own meditations  she did indeed attempt it but finding i had put it out of her power i heard her march down stairs muttering i know not what as she went  now my dear harriot what say you to this pleasant adventure i presume the friendly offer she kindly meant to make me was the dose of poison you once mentioned  shall i confess that i no sooner heard the creatures carriage drive from the door than i was simple enough to burst into tears  simple i say since so despicable a being was certainly beneath my notice but though pride kept up my spirits while she was present they entirely forsook me when left to reflect on the mortifying scene  i found myself relieved by them however and as soon as my eyes were fit to be seen i rung for my maid desiring she would acquaint mrs bellmour i wished to see her  she returned telling me she had been out all the morning  i now sent her to ask who had shown lady beningfield up stairs and to my astonishment found no mortal below knew she had been with me till they saw her coming down she had asked indeed if i was at home on her first entering the house but said no more about it and when they would have attended her to the door she would not permit any one to take that trouble saying her servant was waiting shut the parlour door and instead of going out as they supposed  she slipped up stairs  this is the account the young woman gave my sally  i took no farther notice of it to any of them but mentioned what had passed to mrs bellmour when she returned who was shocked beyond expression declaring she should never set her foot in her doors again let what would be the consequence  to this i objected as she was so good a customer  but in vain  she vowed she never with her consent should gain admittance  i am really astonished how i had courage to bear her insolence with so much calmness but rejoice most truly that i had so much command of myself as i certainly mortified her even more than she mortified me  conscious of my innocence it was but a momentary pain while her ladyship must be sensible she had rendered herself an object of contempt even in her own eyes  i long much to know whether lord templeton has heard of it  ten to one if the foolish insignificant woman has prudence enough to conceal the story though it must set her in so despicable a point of view  if they have differed which i shrewdly suspect or why should she have acted in that absurd manner i make no doubt she will inform him in order to distract him which it cannot i think fail to do if he has any sentimentals of delicacy  i have desired mrs bellmour to conceal the affair from my worthy friend mr douglas it hurts my pride my feelings harriot though i have certainly no cause to blush whatever her ladyship may have but as he is now my lords confident he may chance to hear the story from him  this my dear harriot is the first occasion on which i have severely felt the change in my situation  but for that change this could not have happened  i trust and hope it will be also the last  adieu yours ever isabella rochley  letter the twentyfourth same to the same london it is as i guessed harriot  my lord is distracted at what has happened  i have had the whole history from mr douglas and a letter on the subject from his lordship which i was compelled to receive contrary to my inclinations but what could i do my worthy friend for such i really believe he is was rather hurt at my attempting to decline it as it was certainly condemning him for consenting to convey it to me  i saw he was chagrined and therefore though unwillingly took it from him i will enclose a copy for your perusal  i fear this may bring on a correspondence which i really wished exceedingly to avoid till my brothers return his dear presence would have saved me from all this uneasiness  but there is no help for it i must be doubly watchful over my conduct that is all i can now do  mr douglas who has seriously conceived a real friendship for his lordship declares he is the most accomplished the most engaging young man he ever met with gave me the following particulars of the affair yesterday  their meetings are no longer confined to the coffeehouse on the contrary they are seldom asunder he called upon his lordship it seems in the morning and to his astonishment found him almost frantic  for heavens sake cried he what has thus disturbed you my lord  my dear friend replied his lordship you see before you the most wretched of men  what again my lord  oh spare your railery i am really miserable beyond expression have you then heard nothing has the charming miss beverly concealed from you the unpardonable the cruel insult she has meet with on my account  oh mr douglas she never never can forgive it  it is impossible every hope every glimmering of hope is now lost to me for ever  prithee explain your self said my good friend in the name of fortune what have you done how have you insulted how been guilty of this unpardonable offense  i exclaimed his lordship  i insult the most lovely of women  ah heaven forbid  why then all this distraction if it is not you  i tell you i am the fatal cause and is not that to be completely wretched  not quite replied mr douglas in his dry way  your lordship may be the innocent cause and surely that alters the case but come  let me hear the whole story that i may be the better able to judge whether it is time for you to hang or drown yourself  allow me harriot to make this part of the history as short as i can because you already know the substance of it i mean her ladyships passion for lord templeton  suspecting from the first time of his seeing me that i had made an impression on a heart she wished to have wholly to herself she had him watched and soon learned he made frequent visits to mrs bellmour  at first she rallied him but finding this had no effect she called him false perfidious and ungrateful in fine ranted like any tragedy queen  he pleaded not guily  she finding no better might be pleaded the violence of her love very pleasant that harriot  he returned a most graceful bow  what could a man do more  at last she insisted he should swear her suspicions were without foundation  he protested he was not sufficiently acquainted with either the nature or extent of her suspicions and begged to decline obliging her  she raved  he looked i suppose as every man must naturally do who finds a woman making love to him instead of his making love to her  that is to say rather awkward  finding she could not move his flinty heart she vowed she would go in person to the creature who had robbed her of it and know from herself what sooting we were upon  this threat which he well knew she was capable of putting into execution alarmed him  he swore to expose her conduct to the whole world if she presumed to entertain an idea of that horrid nature  she valued not the world was her reply having lost all she held dear in it  he now condescended to sooth to entreat but this exasperated her the more sensible it was for my sake not her own  they parted with mutual disgust he still flattering himself she would not stoop to such meanness  but to his utter confusion she informed him of what she had done glorying in the distress she had caused and vowing it should not be the last  and now said his lordship having ended his story what have i to hope  why for the felicity of throwing yourself at miss beverlys feet my lord cried mr douglas the very first opportunity and making your peace the best way you can  were she indeed a being cast in the same mould with the gentle creature we have been talking of i should advise you to take a cordial drop by way of saving her the trouble of administering it which she certainly in that case would contrive to do but as she is not i recommend the first plan as the most agreeable  ah  cried my lord  would to heaven i durst flatter myself with the hopes that she would condescend to hear my defense but if even you my dear sir could not prevail upon her to admit me to her presence before this cursed affair how can i now expect it  impossible  then after a pause he added  perhaps mr douglas you may have influence enough with the dear and justly incensed angel to persuade her to read a letter from me i cannot exist unless i have an opportunity of some kind or other to apologize for what has happened this said my friend i agreed to attempt  he instantly sat down and wrote the epistle i mentioned having been in a manner compelled to take harriot  and which i will now transcribe for your perusal as i promised having thus told you the substance of what passed between mr douglas and me on the occasion as well as his dialogue with my lord  miss beverley madam your worthy friend mr douglas will i am persuaded do me the justice to inform you he has just left me the most unhappy of men  and such i must continue unless miss beverly will be equally just by believing i would without hesitation have forfeited my life could i thereby have saved her from the insult  the base the unparalelled insult to my utter confusion i understand she has received from a being who is not only a disgrace to her sex but to humanity  shocked as my feelings must have been when informed of the distracting circumstance supposing i had been no way instrumental to it think what i must suffer while conscious i am the unfortunate cause of the horrid event  to form an idea of my torture at this moment is not in nature those only who love who revere your amiable character as i do can possibly conceive it  pardon me miss beverly for daring at this time to mention a passion which though fervent as it is respectful cannot i fear but be deemed presumptuous after what has happened i know not what i write  my mind is in a state of absolute distraction the thought of what a heart delicate as yours must have suffered from the outrageous behavior of that wicked woman is daggers to mine  oh madam on my knees let me implore you to pity me to relieve my agonized mind by saying you hold me guiltless  heaven is my witness there is nothing in the power of man i would not do or suffer to convince you with how much respect and esteem i am miss beverlys most devoted though truly wretched  templeton   what could i say to this harriot you will i imagine allow since i had been spite of myself prevailed upon to read it some sort of answer was unavoidably necessary  i accordingly sat down and wrote as follows   i have indeed been exceedingly mortified my lord but confess i have pride enough to look down with contempt on a woman who could so far forget herself as to descend to such meaness  i am perfectly convinced your lordship has nothing to reproach yourself with in regard to what has happened you tell me my lord this assurance is necessary to your peace i send it with pleasure as i think i cannot in justice do less  and am your lordships most obedient isabella beverley   having desired mr douglass opinion of it who smiling said it was cool enough to freeze the flame i had kindled in his lordships bosom i sealed and begged he would do me the favor to deliver it  so far am i however harriot from thinking it quite so cool as it ought to have been that i have ever since wished i had blotted out the word pleasure  this you will perhaps say is being wonderfully prudish  i own it would so were i not circumstanced as i at present am his lordship an absolute stranger to me mr douglas almost as much so though we have certainly conceived a good opinion of each other yet who can say i may not be deceived even in him  sorry indeed should i be at so mortifying a discovery but all this makes me more cautious then i should otherwise be  apppearances in reality are rather against me too  a young and tolerable handsome woman in lodgings by herself my family unknown  no acquaintance and averse from making any  it is certainly rather misterious and that can never be an advantage to any one heartily sick i am of it i do assure you particularly since that vile creature has given me such horrid proofs that appearances as i was saying are indeed against me i am impatient beyond expression for my brothers return that i may resume my own name  i now regret i was ever called by any other  yet the same thing might have happened had i not  i think i ought to write to him but am fearful of the consequences however i will consider of it for the present my dear girl i must bid you adieu  believe me ever yours isabella rochley  letter the twentyfifth miss brown to lord templeton my lord london the information i am going to give your lordship will i trust be deemed a sufficient apology for this trouble  it pains me exceedingly to confess i am and have been a daily witness to the most wicked and shameful plot carried on against your lordship that ever was invented though not an accomplice as this letter i hope will serve to convince you  i live with mrs bellmour my lord your attachment to miss beverley as she is called is no secret to any one in the family it is a circumstance too flattering to be concealed  it astonishes me indeed that the misterious conduct they have thought proper to observe does not alarm your lordship they however find it answers their villainous purpose but forgive these reflections they are foreign to what i have to relate  know then my lord that this miss beverly is no other than a natural daughter of mrs bellmours well might she say she had the charge of her education alas she has educated her for the most infamous purposes beautiful and accomplished she is as every one must allow  mr douglas her pretended friend is upon the most intimate footing with her  i blush to write it but her base her most worthless mother sacrificed her to him when scarce fifteen  with him she has lived ever since  i believe indeed he has nothing to reproach her with in regard to her conduct from that time but he has now views of another nature and of course finds miss bellmour for that is her real name an obstacle to them  at the time your lordship was so much struck with her appearance on seeing her here her wretched mother was actually in treaty with a man of fortune who offered to grant her a settlement for life as his mistress  the affair was on the point of being concluded and certainly would before this time had not your lordship given hopes that you might absolutely if things were properly managed be induced to make her your wife  the great difficulty now was what account to give of her family and connections which they naturally imagined would of course be enquired into by your lordship  this was a perplexity not easily got over  they therefore determined to adopt the plan they have since so successfully followed  that is to acknowledge there was a mystery in her situation which she was not yet at liberty to explain  they mentioned an absent relation at whose return all would be cleared up  but the truth is my lord they hoped to exhaust your patience for well do they know no such being exists though i make no doubt they could easily produce a person to assume that character could it answer any good purpose they hoped i say your lordships passion would at last so far blind you as to induce you to make honorable proposals rather than continue to be thus denied permission to visit her  can any thing in life my lord be more artful  i confess it was myself who suffered lady beningfield to go up to her apartment knowing mr douglas was then with her and easily hoping her ladyship might have proof sufficient to have left her no doubt of those suspicions she at present entertains of the duplicity of her character though she mistakes the object miss beverly had however i found contrived to conceal him in a closet time enough to prevent so important a discovery  when i wished her ladyship to be fully convinced i confess it was not from any degree of partiality i felt for her but concluded your lordship would of course be informed of it which knowing your worth and amiable character i most sincerely desired  indeed had my wishes been gratified and she had given your lordship an account of the discovery it is possible it might coming from her have appeared the effects of jealousy and not have gained credit i am no stranger my lord to lady beningfields motives for her curiosity pardon me for taking the liberty to mention this circumstance it leads to another  which is this  finding all her own hopes of gaining your lordships hand at an end she now from the most implacable hatred and revenge would give worlds that you may be drawn in to marry this beautiful but unfortunate girl  i should not be surprised were her ladyship artful enough to attempt even to persuade you to it for she has had power sufficient by the help of gold to learn the truth of miss beverlys story from bellmour the latter from the tenor of her conservation found letting her into the secret would rather promote than frustrate her scandalous design and when fully informed she declared as i mentioned above nothing on earth would give her so much pleasure as to see your lordship so gloriously taken in that was her very expression  beware then my lord of the whole set it is true were lady beningfield to appear an advocate now for a match she so lately dreaded as the greatest of all evils you might naturally suspect her sincerity yet who can say how much an ingenuous a generous mind like your lordships particularly when urged to what at present is so consonant to your inclinations might be induced to credit  that i my lord can have no interested motives for what i write i need hardly mention  on the contrary were it known by any of the family i had thus betrayed them i know not if even my life would be in safety  but i have so much confidence in your lordships honor and am so shocked at the horrible contrivance that i venture it without hesitation  make what use you please my lord of this letter only for the sake of the very important intelligence it contains conceal the name of the writer who now begs leave to subscribe herself  your lordships most obedient and very humble servant jane brown  letter the twentysix lord templeton to colonel rochley london what can tempt you thus to prolong your stay my dear rochley after my repeatedly informing you you have nothing farther to apprehend on sir john westburys account the fellow is quite recovered and ready for another tilting about whenever you will be kind enough to put yourself unarmed in his way again have you no compassion for the divine caroline fie upon you orlando i believed you a man of more gallantry than to absent yourself one moment longer than was necessary for your safety and her happiness of course  do prithee wheel about to the right and march home as fast as you can  i have such a story to treat you with  but i bar all jokes upon the subject mind that or i am dumb  i have had such an escape  no if i live to the age of what is his name in the bible  i shall not have half time enough to be sufficiently thankful  would you believe it i had absolutely brought myself to think seriously of making an offer of marriage to the dulcinea i have so heriocally raved about to you for some time past true upon my honor finding no possibility to storm her castle  or rather i should say to gain admission without storming it i had fully determined to take her for better for worse  her old friend  ah curse him  had so wrought on my passions by his flaming account of her mental perfections those of her person i had seen and admired to my cost that i actually authorized him to assure her i wished for nothing so ardently as to make her honorably mine and implored him to prevail on her to accept my offered hand  yes rochley thus far had my infatuation for the bewitching the enchanting girl seduced me from the paths of common sense when behold my guardian angel inspired one of the infernal pack with sentiments of pity for the scrape i was in she for which i am certainly bound to pray for her every day of my life sent me a full and particular account of the birth parentage life character and behavior of my fair till then unknown enslaver  ah what a falling off was there it was a last dying speech to all my hopes of happiness  all my comfort is i was wise enough to conceal her name and place of abode even from you i will not take upon me more merit than i am entitled to however on that account since the truth is i was so wholly engrossed by describing the angel that those unimportant matters never occured to me but now my not having done it does with no small satisfaction since had you known one or either of those particulars you might possibly have still more reason to laugh at me by finding i had been sighing for a dear creature who had not let you sigh in vain  in short rochley i understand she is neither more nor less at this precious moment than mistress of that old fellow who has taken such pains to ensnare me  this i fortunately learned yesterday from one who resides in the same house and who knows the whole rise and progress of their infamous intrigue  that i am horridly mortified i need not tell you yet would you believe it i am still fool enough to love the dear charming girl in spite of my better judgment it is absolutely incomprehensible to me how a passion violent as this that consumes me could be excited by such transient views as merely seeing her twice at her window and once when by accident i went there with that friend lady beningfield and your caroline the latter was no less struck with the elegance of her figure than myself the former affected to have entirely overlooked her though she has since given too convincing proofs of the falsity of that assertion  but to this there hangs a tale which as things are turned out i cannot take the trouble of recounting  i was driven in my first transports of rage almost to distraction and was tempted to commit some desperate act of violence  but that i fortunately recollected the whole crew of them as unworthy my revenge or rather fear a lurking partiality for the object of my passion checked my resentment  i determined therefore to leave them to enjoy the disappointment to set off instantly for the country and there endeavor to forget the transcendant charms of my perfidious fair one who i am still credulous enough to believe is more to be pitied than blamed  for this weakness you rochley will probably condemn me  but had you seen her yes had you seen the fascinating charmer you too must have adored her as i did  did do i say the same infatuation still persues me and pleads but too strongly in her favor in spite of the dreadful intelligence i have received  that appearances are against her i must allow  strongly against her  yet she may  but what a folly is this  is there a simple doubt remaining  no orlando no  let me fly then  i dare not longer trust my self to write on the subject  farewell my chaise is ordered my only safety is in flight  let me entreat you rochley to return without farther delay to england  come and introduce me to your lovely sister i have often wished to get a sight of her having heard she is the most lovely of her sex come and introduce me to her that in contemplating her perfections i may forget those of a creature who had she been as virtuous must i think in beauty equaled even miss rochley  yours ever most sincerely templeton  letter the twentyseventh miss rochley to miss lenox london i am all astonishment my dear never was there so extraordinary an affair  every thing that has past since my orlando left me appears a dream i really dare hardly trust my senses  i have told you harriot repeatedly told you if i mistake not the unremitted endeavors lord templeton made to prevail upon me to admit his visits i have told you i think how very earnest he was to persuade me he had conceived the most violent passion for me and honorable as violent  all this you have heard but what i am now going to tell you will i fancy surprise you infinitely more  mr douglas delivered the few lines i sent him  his lordship chose to find more beauties than there were letters in the whole performance he was in raptures  transported with my amiable condescension adored me more if possible than ever for my candor  in short set a far greater value on the favor than it was worth and swore he could not exist unless i would permit him to thank me in person and at the same time to offer me his hand and heart begging mr douglas would do all in his power to procure him this blessing  all this the worthy man repeated to me almost as much transported with joy as his lordship and no less earnest with me to grant his request  fully persuaded they were both sincere in their professions i actually found myself beginning to waver in my resolution of waiting for my dear brothers return  so perpetually importuned what could i do  at last i told mr douglas i would take a day or two to consider the propriety of what he asked this was giving hopes and with these hopes he flew to my lord who was again in raptures  during my deliberation my good old friend had been so much engaged in the city that i had scarce seen him by the way i am sorry to tell you he talks of leaving london soon and kindly declares nothing but the interest he takes in my affairs could have detained him here so long  for two or three days i say i scarcely saw him  when yesterday in his way from the city he called on his lordship in order as he drolely said to enquire how his patience held out but guess if you can harriot of his consternation when informed by the porter his lordship had left london the day before ordering him to acquaint any person who might call for him that he should not return for several months perhaps not then as he had some thoughts of going abroad  poor mr douglas was quite thunderstruck and for some time could not believe he understood what the man said  however after his repeating it many times he was compelled though much against his inclination to credit the intelligence  never shall i forget the various passions displayed on his expressive his benevolent countenance when giving me this information  rage  contempt and cruel disappointment were strongly pictured in every feature  how i looked at that embarrassing moment heaven only knows for mr douglas was too violently agitated himself to make any remarks but my feelings were hurt beyond all conception  i felt a glow of pride and indignation on my cheek  and could not articulate a syllable might i have had the universe yet wished to say something in order to persuade him i was not so much disconcerted as his honest worthy heart apprehended  at length after various essays for utterance why my dear sir are you thus uneasy believe me i am not consider i had in fact very little knowledge of his lordship consequently could be no way attached to him have i not great reason to be thankful this is the case i might perhaps had i been better acquainted with him have conceived a partiality then indeed this unaccountable conduct might have given me some pain but as it is  what have i to regret  talk not so calmly replied he with energy do not for the first time since i knew you attempt to play the hypocrite speak of him as he deserves execrate his very name as i do from my soul he is a vilain  yes i say a vilain  none but a being who justly merits that harsh appellation could have behaved in so base so dastardly a manner but by heavens if ever i meet him old as i am i will call him to a strict account he has not only grossly insulted the most deserving of her sex but me also  and dearly shall he pay for it if ever i am so fortunate as to set eyes on him again  yes my good my dear child he shall know that i am not a man to be affronted with impunity  though i just now blamed your prudent your calm behavior be assured i honor you for it it is spirited it is noble and like every other part of your conduct thank heaven you are not attached to so worthless a wretch  no miss beverly i trust a better fate awaits you  i did mean as i told you to leave town in a few days but no business shall now oblige me to quit you  i will stay at least till your brother returns and will before i part from you see you once more safely under his protection and trust he will never again leave so precious a charge to the mercy of strangers  i mean not to reflect on your friend mrs bellmour i believe she is a worthy well meaning woman she could neither foresee nor have prevented what has happened  but let us forget it  come try if you can so far command yourself as to sing me a song go to your harpsichord let it be something cheerful to raise our spiris  i own harriot i thought this request rather mal a propos but convinced he meant it well complied though i certainly did not either play or sing better than usual  he soon after left me charging me to think of the fellow as he deserved were it possible added he i would order you not to think of him at all  this injunction had he given it you may believe i could not easily have obeyed  now tell me my dear what you think of this adventure for my own part i can make nothing of it it is as i said before absolutely incomprehensible have i not infinite reason as i have also before said to be thankful he had not gained that place in my affections he pretended to be so anxious to obtain  good heavens what cause should i have had to reproach myself had i been weak enough to have admitted his visits  i shudder at the very idea of it since it is now evident in spite of all his professions of honor and respect his views were of a very different nature it must be so  no other way can i account for his conduct  but being by mine at last persuaded he could not hope to succeed he thought it needless to throw any more time away upon me  does not this harriot appear the most probable conjecture one can form  yet but a few days before how very different did his sentiments seem to be what agonies did he express for the insult i had met with from that vile lady beningfield  in short i can only repeat it is all a mystery all wholly incomprehensible  another circumstance gives me on reflection much pleasure i mean my never having given a hint to my orlando of my imaginary conquest  i thought it would have an appearance of vanity to tell him of it and that it would be time enough should any thing really come of it how lucky was this my dear harriot on two accounts  first because i am thereby spared the mortification of his knowing i have been thus strangly treated and in the second because had he known it and by whom how very fatal might have been the consequences for that he would not have let the matter pass without resenting it you well know  there is you see no situation so bad as to be void of all consolation  this i lok upon as a reward for my prudent conduct dont you think harriot i have a right to draw this flattering conclusion from those circumstances  it is not unnatural to suppose you will now ask what my heart says to this affair  why my dear i have the pleasure to assure you it behaves very well on the occasion i will confess it had formed a few mighty pleasant plans of future felicity in which lord templeton had a share but it was on a supposition that he was all the world is pleased to represent him that is to say the most amiable and worthy of men  that he is the most elegant in point of person there are few i fancy can deny and were one to judge from the expression of his countenance one would really be much inclined to believe the character he has acquired is no more than he justly deserves  but it has ever been a maxim with the very wise not to trust to appearances  i have pretty substantial reason i think harriot for adopting it  all i can say in short is had he really been what we were simple enough to believe him i should have been very well pleased with my conquest as it is i am truly thankful he failed in quite completing his  adieu my dear harriot i am now going to press my orlandos return indeed the time he proposed being in england draws very near  i can not express half the gratitude i owe to the worthy the kind mr douglas but you i am sure will do me the justice to believe i am deeply impressed by a sense of the many obligations he has confered upon me of his friendship i can have no doubt  yours also i have the happiness to rejoice in  and am your affectionate isabella rochley  letter the twentyeighth same to the same london if my last astonished you my dearest harriot i think i may venture to pronounce this will do it still more i am certainly born to meet with very extraordinary adventures if one may call them such and really though that has rather too much of the romantic in it i know not what other appellation to give them  now prepare my dear girl to be delighted prepare your most eloquent congratulations for your isabella  all her misfortunes are now i trust at an end  at least from this happy moment she may look forward with a certainty of not being again insulted on account of her depressed circumstances i have such news my dear to tell you as will put you out of your little wits with joy this you know is ever your lively expression on any particularly happy event  i wrote as i told you i intended to my orlando begging he would hasten his return  some time after mr douglas and i were sitting together talking over the affair of lord templeton and forming a thousand fruitless conjectures concerning his unaccountable behavior when a postchaise drove to the door  i flew to the window my heart telling me it was my orlando it was harriot it was himself  in a moment i found myself pressed to his affectionate bosom and such was my transport i had very near fainted however i luckily did not  my first agitation a little subsided i recollected my good mr douglas who stood gazing on us with the utmost pleasure taking my darling brothers hand i led him to him  orlando said i let me introduce you to this gentleman much are you indebted to him i do assure you for the constant attention and friendship he has shown your poor isabella he has during your absence been my guardian my generous protector  they embraced each other with great cordiality my brother expressing his acknowledgments of my good friends kindness in the most grateful and pleasing manner  the worthy man would now have left us but we begged he would do us the favor to stay and partake of our satisfaction he then took his seat and was diverted with the thousand questions i asked my dear brother so rapidly as to put it out of his power to answer any one of them  in this delightful situation were we chatting when one of mrs bellmours servants opening the door of my apartment and just peeping in said pray madam is colonel rochley here the postillions are desirous of being discharged  i observed mr douglas looked amazed i protest i had quite forgot the poor fellows cried orlando in my hurry to see you my dear isabella so saying he went down stairs  did i hear right said mr douglas did not the servant mistake your brothers name did she not call him rochley  she did sir how then cried he with a kind of impatience a sort of i know not what in his manner comes yours to be beverley pray explain this mystery i have very particular reasons for being thus inquisitive rochley  good god  can it be is it in nature  speak my dear child and put an end to this suspense  i was diverted with his emotions looking upon them as nothing more than his surprise at finding me so much attached to a half brother which i concluded he now fancied he was by our names being different and was preparing to acquaint him with the truth and why i had taken that of beverly when orlando returned to us  come my dear brother said i smiling come and help to expound an enigma that seems to puzzle my good friend not a little i now gave him the reasons which had induced me to adopt what in the end proved so very perplexing your name then is absolutely rochley cried he with still more energy and expression in his voice and countenance than we thought the case required  both your names are rochley  pardon me i must ask a few more questions  in what part of england did your father live  what was your mothers maiden name  harriot this question gave rise instantly to a thousand confused ideas  never till that moment had it once occurred to me that as her name was douglas as you well know there was a possibility that he might be related to her i now wondered it never had  but there are so many in all parts of the world of the same name yet not related that i never thought about it  in fine i had no sooner told him it was douglas and that our fathers seat was in warwickshire with some other particulars than rising from his seat and gazing on us both with every mark of kindness affection and surprise he exclaimed it must be  it must be so i can no longer doubt it come to my arms my dear children let me press to my delighted heart the son and daughter of my lamented my beloved sister  yes behold in me her only brother  can you my dear harriot figure to yourself our astonishment or our joy  it is impossible  for some moments it produced a scene of the most agreeable confusion he continued to ask a thousand questions to which our answers were so fully satisfactory that not a doubt remained of the very important truth no wonder cried the delighted mr douglas i was so tenderly attached to this dear child she made a most extraordinary impression on me the first moment i beheld her  but it is now easily accounted for  though then it amazed me all lovely and deserving as she is to find how much i felt myself interested in her happiness  may i not flatter myself said orlando respectfully taking his hand the brother of your engaging favorite will also be honored with a place in your esteem be assured my dear sir it shall from this happy moment be the study of his life to merit that distinction  doubt it not cried our kind uncle the striking resemblance i find in you to your amiable mother would alone insure it to you but you have still better claims this dear child has said so much in your praise has set your character in so fair a light that you possessed it long before i saw you and i need not add your manner person and address have confirmed the idea i had formed of you  he again embraced us both with tender affection bidding us look upon him as a father whose greatest pleasure it would be to do every thing in his power to render us happy and if wealth continued he can do it that power thank providence is mine  the news of this discovery was soon spread through the family and my kind friend mrs bellmour sent up her respectful compliments begging we would permit her to wait upon us that she might offer her sincere congratulations upon the fortunate event  this harriot you may easily guess was readily granted  she came up and absolutely shed tears of joy  when we were tolerably composed and the first delightful emotions began to subside mr douglas gave us his history in few words as follows  at eighteen he went to the east indies in a very lucrative employment there he soon made a considerable fortune he married an amiable woman who brought him a large addition to it by her he had two sons who when they were of a proper age he brought over to england for their education  at that time our dear mother was just going to be married she was many years younger than her brother  he was present at her nuptials and having placed his boys under the care of proper masters he returned to india  he had not been there more than twelvemonths when he received the melancholy intelligence of his eldest sons death this was a severe stroke you may imagine my dear harriot to so affectionate so tender a parent  but his affliction was soon after greatly increased by the loss of a wife he adored  i need make no comments on these distressing circumstances your own feelings will render that unnecessary  all his care all his affection now centered in his surviving son  for several years the accounts he heard of his improvements consoled him as far as consolation was possible for his former losses  he had thoughts of coming to england in order to judge how far the encomiums he heard of his son were just when he received a letter from this darling son entreating his permission to join him in india as his education was now fully completed and his inclination led him to return to the land of his nativity to this his father readily consented he soon after obtaining the desired permission but alas harriot  never reached the destined port the ship was lost and every soul on board perished  this dreadful event gave rise o the conjecture that my worthy uncle was also dead as it was beieved he was the mr douglas who suffered that cruel fate and his not returning to england confirmed his friends in this opinion you may have heard it mentioned my dear harriot that my mother had a brother who was supposed ost either going or coming from ndia  my uncle had heard of our mohers death before this last affliction and that she had left a son and daughter  these he now being deprived of all he held dear determined should be heirs to his fortune  he therefore settled his affairs and returned to england and was but just arrived when chance brought him to mrs bellmour  having transacted the business he had to do in london his design was to go into warwickshire to enquire for our family  he heard however in london of our fathers death and the fatal consequences of his misconduct he had intelligence also that his nephew was abroad and was highly pleased with the character given of him of me he had no hopes of gaining any information till he went to the country  thus harriot have i in as few words as possible made you acquainted with the important but happy change in our situation   i am still in so agreeable a flutter that you must excuse me if i now bid you adieu  i think considering all things i have been very minute i will write again soon till then and ever believe me to be affectionately yours  isabella beverley  letter the twentyninth the same to the same london our generous our worthy uncle has now no motive for leaving london having found here what he was going to the country in search of he is therefore busily employed in providing a house carriage servants etc etc the former he has met with in portlandplace the latter you know is easily managed  in this superb mansion my dear harriot is your isabella to preside for he will not enter it he says unless we will both consent to reside with him to this kind request we could not possible make any objections as you may readily conceive  it is to be furnished in the most splendid manner  a most elegant vis a vis is now building for my orlando and for me such a profusion of finery is preparing that were i going to wed an emperor nothing would be found wanting  the worthy man really dotes upon us both and enjoys the thoughts of a certain lords astonishment when he sees me in this stateof grandeur beyond expression we have not yet found a leisure hour to treat my brother with his lordships adventure but mean to do it the first opportunity  in a few days we hope to get into our house it is what is called ready furnished but my uncle finds ten thousand things wanting and many he means to change for more expensive ones such as glasses commodes etc etc in short he has the spirit and i have also reason to believe the purse of a prince  i confess harriot i enjoy no less then he does the amazement lord templeton will be in when he finds the insignificant miss as he no doubt thought me or he durst not have treated me in the strange unaccountable manner he did is thus transformed into a woman of fashion and fortune all my fear is that he is gone abroad as he threatened this would be a woeful disappointment to my uncle and me too for we promise ourselves much diversion from his embarrassment should we meet  all his kind purposes of revenge mr douglass i mean are now laid aside our triumph he very justly thinks will be quite sufficient punishment when joined to our contempt for he makes a point of my looking upon him as a despicable wretch this i am obliged to promise you know harriot but privately add he is a most intolerably handsome one this however is enter nous i dare not for my life say as much to my uncle  he is now abroad making some purchases and my orlando is on guard i shall see but little of him for some time as he has so much extra duty to do to make up for the time he has been absent dear creature he is ten times handsomer than ever no you never beheld so fine a figure as he makes in his regimentals it is certainly on a person so graceful as he is a most captivating dress it has always been said we females are partial to a red coat and i believe it is a fact i am so i confess  think on miss westburys joy on this happy occasion harriot but above all think of her brothers  he will no doubt be prodigiously delighted  not a spark of envy  o no to be sure  i wonder if they have yet heard of what has happened  yet i can hardly suppose orlando could so long refrain from informing her of it though he might forget to send a few lines to his amiable friend sir john  lady beningfield too  how i enjoy the thought of meeting her there i shall indeed triumph surely she must sink into the earth with confusion but she must be callous to every sense of feeling or she could not have behaved in the horrid the insolent manner she has done  i hear my uncles voice  adieu my dear friend i must attend him my next will be from portlandplace  ever yours sincerely isabella rochley  letter the thirtieth colonel rochley to lord templeton london why make such a bustle about my returning to england my good friends when behold on my arrival i find you have thought proper to fly from london the reason your lordship gives for your precipitate retreat is a most laughable one i confess but by no means satisfactory  i think you might have contrived ways and means to have banished the remembrance of your fair what shall i call her not jilt my lord for i think you certainly jilted her  do let me beg you will return to town i am impatient to have the whole account from yourself i have it in fifty different ways already you may be sure but not one of them so clearly as i wish i can make nothing of it  so pray set off on the receipt of this on that condition i promise to tell you a story in return for yours which if not quite so laughable is at least ten times more interesting and important but not one word till we meet your lordship may perhaps also hear mine fifty different ways as i have yours but if you can be satisfied with vague reports i shall begin to think what i never did before that you are not so much interested in my happiness as i have hitherto imagined  if what i have said should prevail upon you to leave the shady groves and purling streams where you are now sighing out your unfortunate love though by the by it is rather a cool amusement at this season of the year your lordship will find me in portland place and there i will have the honor of introducing my sister to you as you desired in your last  she is now in town and i think if a brothers partiality does not mislead his judgment bids as fair to make you forget your present flame as any girl in england  come and see what you think of my taste  yours sincerely orlando rochley  letter the thirtyfirst miss rochley to miss lenox london i have absolutely exhausted my whole stock of exclamations harriot before i have half got through the wonderful things i had to relate i shall be compelled to take to your ahs and ohs from mere necessity though they are more adapted to the tragic than my present story which is rather comic  we have been settled in our new habitation about a week or ten days you may possibly think i ought to have told you so before now but i had something else to do than scribble  you see i begin to give myself airs of importance already harriot could i be a person of fashion and fortune think you if i did not are they not in general a very saucy set of beings i at least have some reason to know they are not all the reverse the lady however to whom i am indebted for so much knowledge was a twig of quality and that to be sure does admit of more hauteur and impertinence than i am yet entitled to exhibit but all in good time  your chief regret i think harriot during my late retirement was my being debarred the joys of society  make yourself easy as to that article now my dear my uncle seems determined to make up for lost time he has a numerous acquaintance amongst the nabobs  that is to say amongst those who like himself have made fortunes in india not that he confines his attention to those only who have succeeded there  which is indeed by no means all who go with that view those who have failed are no less welcome to his table if having failed is their only crime  in short he is the worthiest the most generous of men and idolizes your friend isabella  all i fear is he may take it in his head fond as he is of his niece to make her a present to some one of these sunburned heroes as a reward for the services they have done their country  however i have nothing of that kind to apprehend at present though i have reason to think i have made some impression on a few of their hitherto impenetrable hearts for we have had half a hundred of them to dine with us already  i ought first to have told you the family on whose account my uncle wished to be at mrs bellmours and who are also from the east begged to be introduced to me the moment they heard of the happy discovery  it consists of a mr harcourt his lady a most amiable woman a daughter who though not a beauty is infinitely more pleasing more engaging than many who figure under that denomination and two sons very agreeable young men they are immensely rich and live in a princely style  these are my intimates for all formality was totally laid aside before we had been an hour in each others company  sophia harcourt and i are inseparable  dont be jealous harriot she is my town friend you my country one and being of an older date must continue to occupy the first place in my heart the female department in it  i mean my dear  as for the other  apropos  that leads to the story beforementioned and so here it comes  but first let me tell you what you will say when you have read it harriot  how could you isabella be so provokingly teasing as to leave such a scene to the fag end of your letter twas really ridiculous particularly as all the rest was mere chit chat neither worth your writing nor my reading  let me know in your next if these were not your very words  and now for my story  orlando was sitting with me in my dressing room the other morning my uncle was from home and i had determined to take that opportunity to acquaint im with the history of lord templeton which i had never ill then found leisure to do but ust as i was on the point of beginning a violent rap at the door gain obliged me to defer it  a servant now entered and to my great amazement announced lord templeton  who following im into the room ran to embrace my brother with the utmost appearance of friendship and affection but while in the very act of doing so casting his eyes on me he started turned pale a death and seemed at a loss whethe to credit his senses  it would require fifty pens hariot instead of one to give yo an idea of the scene  his lordsh stood as if petrified with astonisment  i no less so trembling from head to foot gasping for breat unable to account for his impetinent intrusion as it appeared me  my orlando gazing at us by turns with looks of surprise and inquietude  i put on a forbidding air and went toward the window my lord a little relieved by being no longer under my scrutinizing eye ventured to exclaim in a half whisper  good heavens rochley what am i to think of all this i am confounded amazed  what must you   nay my lord interrupted my brother rather let me ask what i am to think you will particularly oblige me if you will be kind enough to inform me for upon my soul i can make nothing of it  all i know for certain is that i was truly glad to see you and after telling you so meant to have introduced you to my sister but you seem to me to be both absolutely thunderstruck by the very sight of each other so i may as well give up all thoughts of that nature since it is pretty evident it will afford no great pleasure to either  your sister my dear rochley cried his lordship in the most violent emotion  your sister  heaven and earth what do i hear  all this time harriot i kept my place at the window my heart beating as if it would burst my stays  good god orlando continued his lordship then i am the most wretched the most unfortunate of men i have sinned yes i have sinned beyond all hopes of forgiveness he then flew to me and throwing himself on his knees took hold of my gown imploring me with the greatest energy to save him from distraction by explaining those perplexities which had nearly turned his brain  orlando now took my hand seeing i was greatly agitated isabella my love said he if you can oblige my lord in his request let me entreat you to do it for i am in no less danger of having my brain turned between you than his lordship  speak i beseech you my dear sister that we may if possible be restored to our sober senses  it seems you only can restore them and for heavens sake be quick in your resolves lest your power should come too late  pray rise my lord cried i turning to him  i confess i was rather surprised to find in a friend of my brother a man who   ah miss beverly said his lordship interrupting me and still on his knees confess rather i have infinitely more cause for wonder to find in the woman i have so long adored the sister of my friend to find miss beverley the lovely the inflexible the obdurate miss beverly so unaccountably transformed into the no less charming miss rochley  if you can account for it  my brother now burst into a violent fit of laughter the name of beverly having explained to him the hitherto seeming enigmatical puzzle  or at least a great part of it he had only therefore to learn how we became known to each other and why his poor sister was treated with so many harsh epithets  this harriot was all i then fancied he had to be acquainted with but soon found he had heard more of the matter than i had imagined  i never saw a creature so much diverted as he was with our perplexity  and to crown all who should now enter the apartment but my uncle  my lord was still at my feet where he seemed determined to remain notwithstanding all my efforts to raise him but had no sooner cast his eyes on mr douglas than he started up as if he had actually seen a ghost to say truth his visit had turned out rather extraordinary  heyday cried his old friend  alas a friend no longer harriot who have we here upon my honor this is as complete a piece of assurance as ever i was witness to some men after a behavior like yours my lord would rather have gone a thousand miles out of their way than have run the hazard of meeting a lady they had treated as you have treated miss rochley but lords have none of that timid bashfulness in their composition i presume  what you have heard i suppose that she is now mistress of a fortune more than equivalent to your merit and very wisely thought it time to renew your addresses as she cannot sure do less than reward such merit as it deserves  pray sir may i ask what the devil put it into your head to   spare me i entreat you cried my lord advancing toward my uncle how and why i came here i can answer without hesitation or even a blush mr douglas but all i have met with since i came appears to me the work of enchantment  i heard my friend colonel rochley was in town and as i had every reason to flatter myself he would be glad to see me nay i have it under his own hand i flew to welcome him on his return to england  he received me with his usual cordiality  but to my utter confusion the first object that struck me on entering here was miss beverly miss beverly however no longer but transformed into the sister of my friend and next to complete my astonishment although i have hitherto conceived your acquaintance with that lady to have been of very short duration you surprise me with your appearance and in an authoritative and peremptory manner which would imply your being perfectly at home here very politely term my visit the height of assurance  that i have something to answer for in regard to miss rochley or rather to miss beverly i freely confess  and i trust i can in some measure exculpate my apparent unpardonable conduct if you my dear sir will with your usual candor deign to listen to my defense that is to say in case you are still as much interested in miss beverlys affairs as when i had first the honor of your acquaintance but of this i can by no means be certain as all things seem to have undergone so strange so incomprehensible a revolution  my uncle himself harriot could not forbear a smile at his distress yet far from being satisfied that he could as he had said excuse his conduct instantly checked it saying yes my lord i am and ever shall be as much interested in miss beverlys affairs as i formerly was and if that circumstance appears a sufficient reason to you why you should endeavor to justify a behavior which i fear it will puzzle your lordship not a little to do fully i am ready to give all my attention  are you my isabella disposed to hear my lords defense your connection with the lady in question i think demands from you this indulgence  i bowed assent harriot to utter a syllable was absolutely out of my power  as for you orlando you being the friend of this very gallant nobleman can do no less  my brother smiling replied it is true my dear sir we have long been friends and i would gladly believe when this mighty history is fairly unravelled we shall find no reason why we should not continue such so pray my lord begin  i harriot was by this time so exceedingly fluttered that i feared i should faint and was obliged to have recourse to my salts  shall i honestly confess i began to feel myself more interested in the business than i had hitherto been it is needless to deny it i trembled for the event and most earnestly wished it happily over  his lordship now took a letter out of his pocketbook and presenting it to my uncle begged him to read it to himself  and why not to the company my lord  pray mr douglas indulge me so far as to look it over first and if you shall then think proper to make the contents known i shall readily acquiesce as i am no stranger to the delicacy of your sentiments  i would now have retired indeed i wished to have done so before but my uncle would not suffer it either then or now saying sit still my child you can have nothing to blush for  he had however no sooner read a few lines than i observed him change color as he went on rage and indignation appeared visibly in his expressive countenance vile abominable wretch he muttered repeatedly as he perused the scrol orlando and i looked on each other unable to guess how the scene would end  my lord frequently stole a glance at me a thousand hopes and fears seemed alternately to agitate his bosom  i really pitied him harriot a something told me he could not be so guilty as we had till now believed however strong appearances were against him i began therefore to flatter myself he would come off with honor  alas i little dreamed that appearances in his lordships opinion had been infinitely stronger against your poor isabella  but to go on  my uncle had no sooner finished the vile task allotted him than turning to me with the kindest look he could assume  you may retire for a moment my dear child said he i must talk this matter over with his lordship it will pain your amiable heart to be present i will say thus much for my lord he is not perhaps quite so blameable as i have hitherto imagined retire isabella the subject is by no means proper for your ear  i could make no reply harriot i was in the most violent palpitation when i rose from my seat insomuch that i could scarcely support myself they all observed it my lord and orlando both flew toward me the latter in pity to his friend drew back and gave my lord an opportunity to lead me to the door he in the mean time ringing the bell for my woman  my conductor returned a look of gratitude to my kind brother for his indulgence and his countenance brightened at this proof that his friend did not think his cause entirely hopeless  can you my dear harriot figure to yourself a more distressing situation than mine during this uneasy state of suspense  ten thousand conjectures offered themselves to my imagination but not one that appeared satisfactory  what that letter could contain on which his lordship seemed to build all his hopes of justification i could not possibly comprehend  who was the author what was the subject  when did he receive it  and why not mention it to my uncle at the time he did receive it if he then wished to be justified  and if it was at that time a matter of indifference to him why so anxious for it now  these were some out of the many questions with which i was perplexing my poor brain when a servant came to desire i would if agreeable to me return to the company  a moment before i was dying with impatience for permission to do so but now found my courage fail me i paused i hesitated wished to go  but after endeavoring to compose the perturbation of my spirits for that purpose found it impossible and was obliged to send my compliments begging my uncle would excuse me as i had a severe headache  what effect this message had on his lordship i know not but in an instant my affectionate orlando was with me  my dearest isabella said he throwing his arms around me why this agitation  why these tremors my dear sister be composed leading me to a sopha on which he sat down by me  ah can i be otherwise than in tremors my kind brother wha am i to think of all this  think with one of his engaging smiles harriot why that yo have been a sly little gipsey th had you as a dutiful sister ough to have done acquainted me wit the important conquest you ha made all this fracas would ha been prevented and my poor frien would not have been the miserable being he is at this moment  he however was more communicative than you chose to be isabella from him i learned the whole progress of his passion while i was abroad but little did i dream my sister was the object of it as he never happened to mention the name of his fair enslaver either by chance or taking it for granted i suppose i should not be the wiser but so it happened and so have happened all the consequences that have followed i mean they have been the consequence of your mutual silence  indeed my dear orlando i never thought what had passed between his lordship and me worth your attention besides would it not have had the appearance of vanity had i been so impatient to acquaint you with it as not to be able to wait your return which i every day expected had i indeed guessed he was your friend or even known to you it is possible i might have given him a page now and then in my letters but pray let me hear what has passed below since i left you  first tell me cried he sweetly taking my hand does my isabella wish to find his lordship acquitted  nay my dear brother that is so odd a question and i fear harriot i felt something very like a blush rise to my cheek i vow i hardly know whether i do or not my lord is nothing to me i cannot strictly say i have any acquaintance with him though he has contrived to make all this confusion  well then replied the sly creature i may without fear of adding to that confusion tell you his lordship made but an indifferent kind of a defense  our uncle you know my dear is not a man to be jested with in such serious matters especially where the happiness of a lady is at stake and that lady his darling niece  is it possible is it really so good heavens  but how ridiculous thus to pretend he even wished for a reconciliation  however it is of no consequence  that is  i mean  in short one would like to have known what apology he had fabricated  ah isabella isabella  your defense my dear girl is ten times worse than his lordships apology cried orlando laughing  my defense why what defense have i to make in the name of wonder  more than you are aware of that becoming blush for instance is one charge i could bring against you were i inclined to malice but the truth is i make the observation with much pleasure admitting it will bear the construction i wish to put upon it  but i will keep you no longer in suspense my dear sister you have suffered too much from that painful sensation already  know then that whatever appearances have been against my poor friend templeton he had reason to think there were abundantly stronger against my isabella  against me exclaimed i almost breathless ah for heavens sake my dear brother be quick in explaining to me the horrid cause of such injurious such ambiguous accusations how on earth can it be  in what manner can i have incurred so much censure is it possible to   have patience my love and i will endeavor to clear up the whole affair  i was unfortunately obliged to go abroad  for reasons already known to you and which i thought sufficient though i believe twas only my anxiety to save you from the very possibility of trouble or insult as i then told you that suggested the idea rather than any real necessity i advised you to change your name till my return  to this single circumstance we may impute all that has happened  it is a proof isabella that we are poor short sighted mortals i advised it in order to protect you and it has on the contrary occasioned the very thing i hoped it would prevent  lord templeton saw you  your charms made a deep and i believe it will be a lasting impression on his heart  how he contrived to inform you of his passion you already know and i also now know with what propriety what true delicacy my isabella conducted herself on the occasion  the cause of his quitting london in the strange abrupt manner he did which so justly gave rise to your astonishment and displeasure appearances were undoubtedly strongly against him the cause i say was the letter he gave my uncle to read  in that letter my poor sister is most capitally slandered and our worthy generous uncle no less so  i will not shock your ears my dear with all the infamous the horrid particulars suffice it to say they are such as fully excuses lord templeton the circumstances are but too plausibly put together  but you will never guess who is the diabolical author of it who nevertheless has not scrupled in order to give the calumny more weight to sign her name to it  ah tell me that at least my dearest orlando let me conjure you but to inform me who can have been so cruelly so causlessly my enemy for sure i am i am unconscious of ever having to my knowledge given offense to any living creature  no other my dear than one of the young women at mrs bellmours her name jane brown  good heavens exclaimed i in the greatest amazement what on earth could be her motive for so horrid a piece of wickedness i am confounded absolutely astonished  after reflecting a few minutes orlando continued i she must have been bribed to this she could have no interest in the affair  it is impossible  she must have been tempted to lend her name to some person of more importance and that person i am positive can be no other than lady beningfield  in order to convince my brother my conjecture was at least founded on probability harriot i now told him of the treatment i had met with from her  i found he was no stranger to her passion for his lordship and of course putting those two circumstances together as i had done was fully persuaded i had cleared up that mystery which to them had been inexplicable  however said my brother we shall soon put the matter beyond all doubt for my friend left us in order to wait upon the amiable miss jane brown and if she has not had the wisdom and decency to decamp he will spare no pains to make her speak truth for once in her life  now my dear isabella if you knew all you would confess that appearances were rather against you as well as your penitent adorer  but ought the said penitent adorer my dear brother to have so readily given credit to the vile insinuations whatever they were  i feel my pride a good deal piqued i assure you orlando at his daring to suspect   isabella your observation in almost any other instance of a similar nature would have been perfectly just answered my brother but if ever a man might be excused for his credulity i must say this case is one of them never was there so infamous a falsehood made to appear so like truth never was there a story of so much plausibility invented or one so likely to gain belief  a girl like that could not i verily think have composed it  yet lady beningfield appears to me even less capable  i mean in regard to the style and manner of expression in short it is a master piece in its kind  but we shall see  in the mean time tell me my love what am i to say to poor templeton for he is as unhappy as any mortal can possibly be  first tell me what said our uncle is he satisfied does he think my lord stands acquitted  why to tell you the truth my dear isabella he too thinks he ought not to have given such implicit credit to the d  nd scrawl as he very justly calls it as not to have made some farther enquiries and continues rather stately yet he owns something may be said in the poor culprits favor but is at present too much irritated to say it himself or hearken to it from another  time however will i trust restore him to his favor and friendship but it is in regard to yours my dear my friend is infinitely more anxious  oh as to mine that is a trifle men get over these violent attachments with wonderful ease be under no apprehensions brother his lordship will do mighty well however i may think proper to decide the matter  isabella that is not spoke with your usual candor  and in revenge i will now tell you that i know to a certainty  yes to a certainty that little heart of thine would be a good deal mortified if you now spoke your real sentiments my friend templeton is not the kind of man to be looked upon with so much cool indifference as my sly sister would persuade me she beholds him with so you may as well drop a character that is not natural to you my dear and be again yourself for believe your orlando you cannot possibly assume any other half so amiable  i kissed his dear cheek harriot for this very kind and pleasing speech and honestly told him i believed he had discovered a window in my breast as he had so easily contrived to get a peep into that heart whose feelings i had so foolishly wished to conceal  that is a good girl now you are again my own isabella  no need to let his lordship into this pretty secret though my dear brother as he was taking his leave of me remember that if you please  o never fear i shall leave him to make the flattering discovery as i have done  so saying he with a significant smile on his fine face left me no doubt to go in search of his penitent friend  really harriot it is full time i should now take my leave of you for this is a most enormous packet but i wished to give you the whole story without any interruption in my narrative how it will end is more than i can at present take upon me to inform you of though things seem to be taking rather an agreeable turn  i have had so much to say about myself that i have had no time lately to write a single word about my orlandos fair one i will just mention however that he has had a most delightful billet doux from the dear girl and that she continues all he can possibly wish  sir john is in statu quo  which being rendered into plain english is a bear still swearing she shall never if he can prevent it give her hand to the man who would have taken his life  if he can prevent it harriot  that is a saving clause  for it runs strangely in my head he cannot ergo she will give it him and that too ever many months ensue  this i know is your wish as well as mine adieu my dear girl  believe me ever most affectionately yours isabella rochley  end of the second volume
