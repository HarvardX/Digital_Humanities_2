originals in my custody which with these were transmitted to me from ireland and this volume will be closed with whatever additional letters mr pope shall think fit to insert in his works in prose now

last volume of literary correspondence shall be prefixed a faithful account of mr popes life and writings with a true copy of his last will and testament if he makes one  i am gentlemen your obliged humble servant e curll   nov      domimina nustio illumea    original letters mr pope to dean swift written in the year       dear sir i find a rebuke in a late letter of yours that both stings and pleases me extremely your saying that i ought to have writ a postscript to my friend gays makes me not content to write less than a whole letter and your seeming to take his kindly gives me hopes you will look upon this as a sincere effect of friendship indeed as i cannot but own the laziness with which you tax me and with which i may equally charge you for both of us have had and one of us has both had and given a surfeit of writing so i really thought you would know yourself to be so certainly entitled to my friendship that it was a possession you could not imagine needed any farther deeds or writings to assure you of it  it is an honest truth there is no one living or dead of whom i think oftener or better than yourself i look upon you to be as to me in a state between both you have from me all the passions and good wishes that can attend the living and all that respect and tender sense of loss that we feel for the dead whatever you seem to think of your withdrawn and separate state at this distance and in this absence dean swift lives still in england in every place and company where he would choose to live and i find him in all the conversations i keep and in all the hearts in which i would have any share  we have never met these many years without mention of you besides my old acquaintance i have found that all my friends of a later date are such as were yours before lord oxford lord harcourt and lord harley may look upon me as one intailed upon them by you lord bolingbroke is now returned as i hope to take me with all his other hereditaryrights and indeed he seems grown so much a philosopher as to set his heart upon some of them as little as upon the poet you gave him it is sure my ill fate that all those i most loved and with whom i have most lived must be banished after both of you left england my constant host was the bishop of rochester sure this is a nation that is cursedly afraid of being overrun with too much politeness and cannot regain one great genius but at the expense of another i tremble for my lord peterborow whom i now lodge with he has too much wit as well as courage to make a solid general and if he escapes being banished by others i fear he will banish himself this leads me to give you some account of my manner of life and conversation which has been infinitely more various and dissipated than when you knew me and cared for me and among all sexes parties and professions a glut of study and retirement in the first part of my life cast me into this and this i begin to see will throw me again into study and retirement  the civilities i have met with from opposite sets of people have hindered me from being violent or sour to any party but at the same time the observations and experiences i cannot but have collected have made me less fond of and less surprised at any i am therefore the more afflicted and the more angry at the violences and hardships i see practiced by either the merry vein you knew me in is sunk into a turn of reflection that has made the world pretty indifferent to me and yet i have acquired a quietness of mind which by fits improves into a certain degree of cheerfulness enough to make me just so good humoured as to wish that world well my friendships are increased by new ones yet no part of the warmth i felt for the old is diminished aversions i have none but to knaves for fools i have learned to bear with and those i cannot be commonly civil to for i think those next to knaves who converse with them the greatest man in power of this sort shall hardly make me bow to him unless i had a personal obligation to him and that i will take care not to have the top pleasure of my life is one i learned from you both how to gain and how to use the freedoms of friendship with men much my superiors to have pleased great men according to horace is a praise but not to have flattered them and yet not to have displeased is a greater i have carefully avoided all intercourse with poets and scriblers unless where by chance i have found a modest one by these means i have had no quarrels with any personally and none have been enemies but who were also strangers to me and as there is no great need of an ecclaircisment with such whatever they writ or said i never related not only never seeming to know but often really never knowing any thing of the matter there are very few things that give me the anxiety of a wish the strongest i have would be to pass my days with you and a few such as you but fate has dispersed them all about the world and i find to wish it is as vain as to wish to live to see the millenium and the kingdom of the just upon earth  if i have sinned in my long silence consider there is one to whom you yourself have been as great a sinner as often as you see his hand you will learn to do me justice and feel in your heart how long a man may be silent to those he truly loves and respects  i am dear sir your ever faithful servant a pope  lord bolingbroke to dean swift this seems to be written by way of postscript to mr popes letter  i am not so lazy as pope and therefore you must not expect from me the same indulgence to laziness in defending his own cause he pleads yours and becomes your advocate while he appeals to you as his judge you will do the same on your part and i and the rest of your common friends shall have great justice to expect from two such righteous tribunals you resemble perfectly the two alehousekeepers in holland who were at the portrait of henry lord viscount bolingbroke henry ld visct bolingbroke murray pinx      parr sculp  same time burgomasters of the town and taxed one anothers bills alternately i declare before hand i will not stand to the award my title to your friendship is good and wants neither deeds nor writings to confirm it but annualacknowledgments at least are necessary to preserve it and i begin to suspect by your defrauding me of them that you hope in time to dispute it and to urge prescription against me i would not say one word to you about myself since it is a subject on which you appear to have no curiosity was it not to try how far the contrast between popes fortune and manner of life and mine may be carried  i have been then infinitely more uniform and less dissipated than when you knew me and cared for me that love which i used to scatter with some profusion among the whole female kind has been these many years devoted to one object a great many misfortunes for so they are called though sometimes very improperly and a retirement from the world have made that just and nice discrimination between my acquaintance and my friends which we have seldom sagacity enough to make for ourselves those insects of various hues which used to hum and buz about me while i stood in the sunshine have disappeared since i lived in the shade no man comes to a hermitage but for the sake of the hermit a few philosophical friends come often to mine and they are such as you would be glad to live with if a dull climate and duller company have not altered you extremely from what you was nine years ago  the hoarse voice of party was never heard in this quiet place dawley  gazettes and pamphlets are banished from it and if the lucubrations of isaac bickerstaff are admitted this distinction is owing to some strokes by which it is judged that this illustrious philosopher had like the indian fohu the grecian pythagoras the persian zoroaster and others his precursors among the arabians magians and the egyptian seres both his outward and his inward doctrine and that he was of no side at the bottom  when i am there i forget i was ever of any party myself nay i am often so happily absorbed by the abstracted reason of things that i am ready to imagine there never was any such monster as party alas i am soon awakened from that pleasing dream by the greek and roman historians by guicciardin by machiavel and by thuanus for i have vowed to read no history of our own country till that body of it which you promise to finish appears  i am under no apprehensions that a glut of study and retirement should cast me back into the hurry of the world on the contrary the single regret which i ever feel is that i fell so late into this course of life my philosophy grows confirmed by habit and if you and i meet again i will extort this approbation from you i am consilio bonus sed more eo productus ut non tantum recte facere possim sed nil non recte facere non possim the little incivilities i have met with from opposite sets of people have been so far from rendering me violent or sour to any that i think myself obliged to them all some have cured me of my fears by showing me how impotent the malice of the world is others have cured me of my hopes by showing how precarious popular friendships are all have cured me of surprise in driving me out of party they have driven me out of cursed company and in stripping me of titles and rank and estate and such trinkets which every man that will may spare they have given me that which no man can be happy without  reflection and habit have rendered the world so indifferent to me that i am neither afflicted nor rejoiced angry nor pleased at what happens in it any farther than personal friendships interest me in the affairs of it and this principle extends my cares but a little way perfect tranquillity is the general tenor of my life good digestions serene weather and some other mechanic springs wind me above it now and then but i never fall below it i am sometimes gay but i am never sad i have gained new friends and have lost some old ones my acquisitions of this kind give me a good deal of pleasure because they have not been made lightly i know no vows so solemn as those of friendship and therefore a pretty long noviciate of acquaintance should methinks precede them my losses of this kind give me but little trouble i contributed nothing to them and a friend who breaks with me unjustly is not worth preserving as soon as i leave this town which will be in a few days i shall fall back into that course of life which keeps knaves and fools at a great distance from me i have an aversion to them both but in the ordinary course of life i think i can bear the sensible knave better than the fool one must indeed with the former be in some or other of the attitudes of those wooden men whom i have seen before a swordcutlers shop in germany but even in these constrained postures the witty rascal will divert me and he that diverts me does me a great deal of good and lays me under an obligation to him which i am not obliged to pay him in another coin the fool obliges me to be almost as much upon my guard as the knave and he makes me no amends he numbs me like the torpor or he teizes me like the fly this is the picture of an old friend and more like him than that will be which you once asked and which he will send you if you continue still to desire it  adieu dear swift with all thy faults i love thee entirely make an effort and love me on with all mine  bolingbroke  almahide an ode by henry saintjohn esquire an incorrect copy of this poem was published in the year   0   i long have i wandered from the muses seat where ever present to the poets eyes a thousand grateful objects rise where all is gay and all is sweet where when past images we find by memory with these combined she from her store of fading sense can move and frame no fancy but of joy and love where every muse and every grace resides the sacred temple where apollo hides from the profane and vulgar eyes his aweful mysteries this blooming garden of the delian god long since i left new paths to try on rough uneven ground i trod and sought the gloomy dark abode of wisdom and philosophy ii from hence escaped with joy to thee i come thee i revisit now my native home that magic land no more i will tread nor drink of those lethargic streams that with their poison taint the blood and stop the sprightly purple flood that upward to the sickly head send lazy vapors idle dreams again i will taste of the prophetic rill which rises fast by the picrian hill phoebus all other nymphs forsook to chase castalia young and fair to bathe in her delightful waves all other waters now he leaves he loosens here his golden hair and plunges in the lucid brook once the coy maid refused the grace and would not suffer his divine embrace now wiser grown no more she will fly but clasps the god and hugs the naked deity iii as mariners their canvas wings distend leaving the pole to every northern blast southward their courses bend and the artic circle past the temperate zone with pleasure meet with pleasure feel the glowing heat and as they nearer to him run salute the long abandoned sun thus from the frozen skies where once benumbed she lay my muse to milder regions flies and to parnassus wings her way iv methinks already in my heart i feel a secret warmth arise which thence diffused to every vital part glows in my face and sparkles in my eyes i see the summit of the hill with spires of glory crowned and nearer now i see the mound such was apollos will raised by the muses to keep off the crowd of thronging poets insolent and loud wretches whom though he daigns not to inspire would yet be placed among the golden choir v here garth appears to whom consigned the double charge of health and wit we find apollo grieved to see his arts disgraced physic and poetry at once debased their sacred ends for public good designed perverted to destroy and plague mankind to garth the double charge imparts of living verse and healing arts him when the god resolved to send he bid hygieia on his steps attend bid every muse and every grace prepare to warm the bard with all their fires to join his song with all their lyres and make his matchless poem the dispensary all their care vi but now arrived i mount the sacred hill and joy and rapture all my senses fill my melancholy thoughts retire apace and fly like demons from the place i feel i feel the god return he takes possession of my breast and i with all his fury burn again i feel the pleasing smart love fills his ancient throne my heart a charming tyrant and a welcome guest vii i know ye well ye silent groves conscious of my secret loves tell me how often have i found beneath your gentle shade in pensive act upon the ground the mournful strephon george granville esquire late lord lansdowne laid strephon the glory of our british plains the wish of all the nymphs and envy of the swains how often have i heard his charming voice through all the neighboring hills resound and to repeat the heavenly notes rejoice with the countess of newburgh myra he begins his lays and ends em all in myras praise nothing but myra dwells upon his tongue charm of his heart and subject of his song her beauty and the verse alike succeed nor can oblivion fear for after ages shall with rapture read what we with rapture hear the powerful lute on which the thracian played was by the muses to the skies conveyed one more bright star shall in the field appear and granvilles pen adorn the glittering sphere viii but soft i hear the sounding lyre and see the god is near and all the tuneful choir i have reached the towering height it is here the muses stay from hence i will take my flight and wing my airy way aloft my muse and i will go she scorns to aim at little things at heroes or at kings she cannot stoop so low to almahide address thy song it does of right to her belong soar like the theban swan on high nor be afraid to venture nigh the flaming region of the sky ix go on my muse go on boldly approach the sun and from his chariot wheel attempt to steal the sacred fire that does the gods inspire then may thou in immortal lays a more than mortal beauty praise or should thy melting pinions fail and i precipitate descend should my unlucky stars prevail and give my days this fatal end yet in the monuments of fame i shall secure a lasting name and to have dared a thing so great will place me far above the power of fate then when i draw my latest breath should almahide vouchsafe to smile that would compensate for my death and more than pay me for my toil x stay foolish muse thy hurry stay where will thy madness run to almahide direct thy way and seek no other sun it is she supplies with brighter eyes the distance of the god of day when they are shut in britain then it is night and we eternal darkness fear but when the radiant balls appear we feel their warmth and bless the rising light thus shall my theme my song inspire and heat my breast with double fire and thus my humble genius raise high as the beauty that i praise thus be my want of strength supplied thus may she grant what nature has denied i ask no inspiration but from almahide xi in the worlds early days when first religion did appear religion which has cost mankind so dear when men began to raise gods to themselves and then those gods to fear chose various lords and tired of being free of every virtue framed a deity had almahide been known had she been born to shine they had adored no other shrine all these perfections are in her combined the fom of venus and dianas mind her rays a luster like the suns dispense and shed on all a bounteous influence a cruel glance from those fair eyes a word by her in anger spoke gives more alarms than jove in arms and swifter than his lightning flies and surer than his stroke only below she could not dwell or hell would be no longer hell at her approach the realms of woe would change their horrid face the burning flood forget to flow and furies fly the place xii and see the lovely form appear before my ravished eyes close to yon crystal stream the charmer lies behold her swains behold her there impending branches shield the fair and beds of camomile the beauteous burden bear see how reclining on the grass in this clear brook her faithful glass first she collects her scattered hair then in tresses as she dresses places every flower that is gay places all the pride of may not to adorn but to compare in vain with here is their brightest colors vie the blushing rose its weakness knows and vanquished lillies own her victory nor raises she her head but downward bent approves their form and smiling seems content observe the troops of loves that swarm about the groves lean on their wings and hanging in the air mistake the nymph and think their mother there xiii gently sweet zephyr gently blow and make the injurious mantle rise and wound our hearts and please our eyes unveil the nymph dear wind remove those clouds that hide this world of love and see the friendly breeze obeys saluting he betrays o give her slave to know that sea of milk those hills of snow and all the blissful vales of joy below he would but can no more disclose resisting robes oppose the thousand folds of that invidious vest inshrine their treasure and our sight arrest corporeal eyes no farther reach but fancy is not thus confined fancy can enter through the smallest breach and through the subtle plaits a passage find thus having pierced the screen fancy relates what she has seen and tires the soul while she instructs the mind xiv thus we fond wretches court our fate and when the pointed darts increase the pains we might abate and plunge em in our hearts in vain we hope to find a cure no remedy is nigh without relief we must endure and without pity die fair almahide gives love to all all that dare look her victims fall but she herself receives from none or what is the same to me from one one happy man that dwells within those arms tastes all her joys and rifles all her charms while dying crowds of lovers stand and look and gaze and wish to share but virtue with her magic wand encircles round the happy pair thus when the moon on larianlatmus lay the last thought and the last line are taken from lord lansdowne i think myself obliged to own the debt though i am unable to pay it  and rapt in pleasure laughed her hours away her beauty and her light to all mankind without distinction shined but to endymion was her love confined alluding to the story of diana and endymion  dawleyfarm the retirement of lord bolingbroke it is sung that exiled by tyrannic jove apollo from the starry realms above to sylvan shades to grots and streams retired and that new scene and that new state admired admired but found with pleasure and surprise himself the same on earth as in the skies a simple majesty an easy grace composed his steps and lightened in his face the wondering swains and nymphs wherever he trod at distance gazed and recognized the god wherever he passed the world his influence knew and learning arts and wisdom round him grew still though in silent privacy he gave his wonted aid inspired the wise and brave taught patriots policy taught poets sense and bade all live or die in libertys defense sure this is verified what here we view in bolingbroke has made the fiction true see emblem of himself his villa stand politely finished regularly grand frugal of ornament but that the best and all with curious negligence expressed no gaudy colors stain the rural hall blank light and shade descriminate the wall where through the whole we see his loved design to please with mildness without glaring shine himself neglects what must all others charm and what he built a palace calls a farm here the proud trophies and the spoils of war yield to the scythe the harrow and the car to whatever implement the rustic wields whatever manures the gardens or the fields contrast of scenes behold a worthless tool a dubbed plebeian fortunes favorite fool laden with public plunder loll in state midst dazzling gems and piles of massy plate midst arms and kings and gods and heroes quaff his wit all ending in an ideotlaugh whilst noble saintjohn in his sweet recess by those made greater who would make him less sees on the figured wall the stacks of corn with beauty more than theirs the room adorn young winged cupids smiling guide the plow and peasants elegantly reap and sow the mantuan genius thus in rural strains adds grace to cots and dignity to swains makes phaebus self partake the farmers toil and all the muses cultivate the soil while free of heart and eloquent of tongue his speech as tuneful as that heavenly song suspends in rapture each attentive guest words more delicious than his generous feast wit more inspiring than his flowing bowl  the feast of reason and the flow of soul o britain  but it is past  o lost to fame the wondrous man thy glory and thy shame conversing with the mighty minds of old names like his own in times bright list enrolled here splendidly obscure delighted lives and only for his wretched country grieves while thou ingrate infatuate as thou art of thy mad conduct long shall feel the smart long mourn the folly which thy weal destroys and rue the blessed retirement he enjoys letters of doctor garth to lady ranelagh at bath madam i hope the waters agree very well with her highness princess anne of denmark  and i wish they may answer all the intents they are taken for and that they may not only confirm her highnesss health but that the whole nation may be blessed with the fruits of it in contributing to the increase of the royalline which will be of much more advantage to these kingdoms than extending our line in flanders for there we may have sufficient encouragement to look after ourselves and not after the security of strangers here is nothing at all of news neither that dunkirk is taken nor namure besieged so that i suppose the army is in very good health for i hear nothing to the contrary and considering how great an army we have it is as much as can be expected that they take care of their healths this is all the news from abroad and as for the news at home the only is that the queen sent into the city to borrow  00000 l upon the security of a vote the parliament made that if the pollbill did not arise to   00000 l they would make it up some other way the next session i am very glad the city has that good opinion of the house of commons as to think they will not alter their opinions another piece of news is that a young lady hanged herself for love in leicesterfields i suppose she was really in love and perhaps the first that ever was so i wish the city had as good a security for their money as she has given for her love i am madam  yours etc s garth london sept        to lady ranelagh madam i am very sorry that the waters that have workt wonders as they say upon all people who have drank them this year should disagree with your ladyship i could find in my heart to send some people who are very sick thither and then i am sure i shall ruin their reputation or else send some sour consumptive fanatic that has a constitution as stubborn and untoward as his principles and if he should chance to miscarry they will call them jacobitewaters and if they should once get that name it would clear you from a great deal of troublesome company who have a mind signally to distinguish themselves from the rest and the truth of it is it is but reasonable there should be a distinction made in a place that is the rendevous of all the leprous we are here something surprised at the news that the mayor of bath was ordered by my lord nottingham not to wait upon the princess to chuch because he was the queens officer i am very glad her highness does not bathe in the queens bath for then may be the secretary might have forbid that too i do not know what can be done next without they disarm the duke of gloucester because he has got a sword and is huzzaed into the house i am informed of a great many ladies that will not pay the respect that is due to her highness and as they will pay no visits so it would have been much better if they did not receive visits from others i shall take care for the future to prescribe them husbands instead of gallants to go along with them i hope my lady a has given you no reason to be jealous i knew her before she married a fool in oxfordshire and her own men servants knew her there to much better purpose only once their service was a little too hot for them i find that those who are jilts would be thought for the government and considering how we have been jilted they may well claim a pretension to it i wish they had behaved themselves sincerely toward it and then they need not have been unmannerly to show their affection to it i am  madam your ladyships etc s garth london sept         the honorable george granville esquire to mr burnaby you enquire my friend whether you should show your comedy the ladys visitingday he has likewise wrote three other comedies   love betrayed or the agreeable disappointment   the modish husband   the reformed wife  to your acquaintance before its representation i answer in the negative which i shall confirm by the following reasons  the reputation a poet obtains from the public applause is not altogether imaginary for the number of those who are not influenced by it is so very small that he is out of fear of danger from them nay those very men who on a private perusal of some plays entertained but an indifferent opinion of them fondly debauched by their success run their approbation up to bigotry never reflecting that as a mans name often subserves to his public reception without regard to his performance so the gracefulness of the action and the pomp of the theater joined to the injudicious claps of the audience as often give the greatest applause to the worst plays and for a while preserve the general esteem of the town for when once a play has got that on its side a great many men of sense rather swim down than stem the tide or oppose the vogue at the expense of the imputation of singularity this is evident from some late plays i had almost said farces against which the best critics declared in vain  but before the action a moderate character of a play from a man of tolerable sense shall by his parsimonious praise damn it though ever so meritorious for the judgment of the audience being not yet past in its favor the town is ready to take the first impressions from any man whose plausible assurance has got him the reputation of a critic because people hope by falling in with his censure to give a sufficient proof of their understandings a poet therefore in submitting his play before action to a perusal runs as many hazards as he confides it to men who want either candor or judgment and among those that the vulgar voice has allowed wits a man with such qualifications is not very easy to be found one of these wits always overvalues himself and believing that he is master of a great deal of sense when his portion perhaps but just seasons him from fool and so only finishes a coxcomb who thinks the only way to establish himself a wit is by finding fault and the town which is not overnice in distinguishing betwixt merit and pretense is often imposed on by the coxcomb it mistakes for a man of sense and biased by the general malice of mankind that inclines most men rather to believe ill than good of another it strikes in with his injudicious as well as unjust censures  there is another sort of wits though of somewhat a higher class whom a small stock of learning and the flattery of some of their acquaintance has confirmed in the selfopinion of being good critics and with these the poet yet runs a greater risque for it is impossible to please them with any thing modern except their own these critics have a very contemptible opinion of the age they live in and think fortune extremely severe in not casting them into the times of euripides horace or it may be shakespeare and they are angry with providence for planting them so far northward who might have made a figure in a more southerly clime among the firstrate wits of old greece and italy they think so meanly of all they know that they would sooner admire a scribler they never saw than a man of the best sense of their own acquaintance they censure the wit by the countenance and the man whose face they are disgusted with must never hope to please them with his understanding if ever they happen to think well of any mans wit for a while for their good opinion of any one is of a very short duration it is when they meet with one as illnatured and vain as themselves then their spleen at the merits of others being gratified with railing blinds them to a momentary satisfaction in the defamer but that being over their native pride returns and they look down on him too for all their talent and time is expended in speaking well of themselves and their own writings and ill of every body else but then thew orld is often even with them for they generally are pleased with themselves without a rival  indeed there is often a magisterial pride and ill nature in men of a great deal of wit and learning which almost overthrows all their merit or at least makes one angry to find things so valuable in such ill hands for when praise or success has once debauched a mans judgment into opiniatre he is but a fool of his own making ten times more intolerable than a fool of gods making  again there are some who are but lately established wits by a lucky hit and hope to keep up that character by depressing others or damning what they write with faint and affected praise these are for keeping fame chaste though themselves are an instance of her prostitution that is for their own use only never reflecting that she like those of whose sex she is painted is capable of satisfying more than one nay that like a pretty woman it is almost impossible to keep her to ones self these particularly avoid for their recent success makes their pride more lively and their apprehension of any rival more strong  mr wycherleys couplet reaches abundance of our current wits or critics those who write ill and those who never durst write turn critics out of mere revenge and spite   yet all these have it in their power to do a great deal of mischief to a poet who is so bold as to venture his reputation in their hands because the undiscerning town never reflects that as a critic is the last refuge of a pretender to wit so he that is full only of the faults of an author is less deserving even of that name than he who sometimes rises up to a taste of his excellencies nor does the town consider that a great many men have no other way of keeping within the pale of wit but by excluding those who are only capable of excluding them  there are another sort of men who pass for wits with the town that are far from being so and these are your laughers merry rogues who have a mortal aversion to thought and as they laugh at every thing even what they say themselves it is not to be expected they should spare the most serious performance  lastly the judgment most men make of books is generally very erroneous in judging the performance by the author not the author by the performance if a man through inexperience or any accidental misfortune have the ill luck not to please in one thing some will by no means allow him a capacity of pleasing at all though mr dryden mr wycherley mr otway and every eminent poet have been proofs of the contrary while some successful to a wonder in their first attempts have mouldred away and dwindled in a little time to less than the shadow of those mighty men their first settingout promised and indeed popular applause is too common a test of the writers merit of which the best poets have complained both in greece and rome petronius arbiter in the person of eumolpus gives it as an observation in his time  ego inquit poeta sum and ut spero non humillimi spiritus si modo coronis aliquid credendum est quas etiam ad imperitos defer gratia solet  the ignorant as well as the learned share the applauses of the town and there has scarce appeared a scribler so despicable in reality as not to have been some time or other the favorite of a day  these and many more hazards a man runs who has the assurance to consult those we generally call friends before the representation and the fortune of a poem and that of a man meet with the same measure when a poem by the public reception is past needing particular approbations the wits are lavish of their praise but when their approbation might establish its public reception they are very scrupulous of bestowing it the benefit therefore that you expect by it being small and uncertain the damage so apparent and considerable i think it safer to come to the public with all ones faults than by false hope of mending them by advice have them turned to the ruin of the whole poem and having given you my judgment you may as men generally do follow your own fancy it is enough i have endeavored to serve you and to prove that i am what i pretend  your faithful friend geo granville whitehall    may   00

winter and a summer here the latter is much the best i was so contracted together in the winter that i was in a manner dead with cold and fit for nothing but to be dissected often am i put in mind of the wide difference between petersburg and old england not only on account of its coldness but unpoliteness for i well remember how my dear mamma used to give orders to our servants to keep a thorough silence in the house till i was awake in a morning and when that news was brought her with what an endearing tenderness did she enquire after my health but here the russian bearbrutes with their heels and their tongues make as loud a din up and down stairs before we are stirring as there is at drury lane after the play is over such is the servile politeness of russia however i bless god i have my health and am sensible it will be a secret pleasure to you to hear of my welfare and i must declare that i am as happily situated as you could wish me and am used entirely to my own satisfaction for my part under misfortunes i shall always advise traveling it being pleasurable to attempt the most distant part of the globe with a resolution and trust in the divine providence which never fails those who rely on it this i offer exclusive of predestination and all fanatic cant when in our voyage the captain told me we should that night go through the gulf methought he little knew how great a one i had shot when i left england to sail threethousandmiles with only a splendidshilling in my pocket i have without the least anxiety resigned all i ever had in this world except friendship and that i never will part with but with my breath i shall therefore most gratefully acknowledge that to you it is i owe my present happiness and am your much obliged friend and humble servant  eliz justice  ii petersburg oct         sir be pleased now to take an account of this place from above fifteen months experience  the gentleman and lady mrs justice went over as a governess to some young ladies obliged thereto by the dishonorable practice of her husband lately transported for robbing the libraries at cambridge she was the daughter of an eminent physician in yorkshire and brought mr justice a very handsome fortune he has had by her three children which are kept by his own mother a worthy gentlewoman now living in the city of york i am with have used me with the greatest tenderness humanity and politeness that is possible he is just generous and obliging she is virtuous charitable and compassionate and i do from my heart say they are the persons to whom i am and wish to be obliged  as to the russian climate it is extreme cold as you may imagine when eighteen thousand men were lately reviewed upon the ice carriages of all sorts laden with goods are every day drawn over it but indulgent heaven to make up this severity has given plenty of wood and furs to fence against the cold  the people are very strong and can endure great hardship as to their beauty i cannot say in painting they would make very soft pieces for the lines of their faces are very strong they are most of them of a good height but the men wear very long beards the ladies are or can be just what you please for only say what complexion you like and they will instantly put it on being well versed in painting  as to their conversation i will not say any thing of it not understanding their language but they bow very much and are civil to strangers they can dispense with more dirt and much more food than the english  their churches are finely adorned with what they call gods they go to church in the night and he who makes the lowest bow is most religious  as to their servants they are the most ignorant creatures living and have every thing which attends ignorance that is ingratitude dirt and sauciness and are in my opinion far inferior to a well taught bear  their buildings are very magnificent and their houses are very warm having an oven in every room to which i creep close  the diversions of the place are these twice a week an opera and now and then a serious game at ombre for what will never hurt any body love and friendship and on a moonlight night a tour upon the ice in a sled  as to scandal here is enough of it but the gentlemen rival the ladies of the talent always allowed them of a little tittletattle  here is no occasion for sir clement cotterel for they are much upon the sans ceremony there is one thing that i believe they exceed any part of the world in illuminations which they make about four or five times a year and the expense is above sixty sand pounds a year and in my opinion it is well worth it  as to provisions here is every thing very good and in great plenty as to liquors they are the same as to port wine they wonder what it is but french wine as chatteaumargouz burgundy tocai arrack we every night drink to all friends in old england  in short here is no want of any thing but agreeable company and except the family i am in there is not a person that i should not think my time as lost with if i conversed with them the rules i go by are these i think no one my friend and therefore cannot be deceived i hear all and say little i keep my old maxim of giving no affront nor will not tamely take one i believe from this time i shall always put into lotteries for i am apt to think my luck is turned in happening to be so fortunate as to come into so worthy a family  i make no excuse for this long letter it is in compliance of your request and i desire your acceptance of my acknowledgments for all favors conferred on  sir your etc eliz justice  iii petersburg dec         sir i entreat your acceptance of a winterpiece the scene of this country is quite changed the agreeable river which ran by my window is now consolidated into a fixed substance of ice i daily see numbers of carriages riages covered with snow and the mens beards look as if they were set with diamonds by the isicles hanging about them the green trees are become so white that they put me in mind of the rosemary upon cakes at twelfthtide and the gentlemen and ladies i think are turned into different creatures of all sorts by their dress being habited in skins of diverse beasts yet notwithstanding the severity of the frost the houses are kept warm by ovens as i observed in my former they give an equal heat but are not to me so agreeable as english fires wherein i think is a kind of cheerfulness that i prefer to this method  the diet of russia is excellently good and in my opinion this place is very fit for an epicure for in short eating and drinking take up a third part of their time  retirement is my delight and when my little ladies and i are together i want no other company nor employment when i have a leisure hour to my self i spend it in reading  all the news i can send you is that the english resident gave a very elegant entertainment on the kings birthday which concluded with a ball i was not at it for my dress is still brown camlet and i think that best for retirement i make up the disappointment of feasts by attending a very polite entertainment that is in reading the spectator for i really think i am now arrived to that happiness he so agreeably represents of being least alone when quite alone on which i put this construction that books are the best companions pardon my prolixity but as i am of the sex who seldom are concise i entreat you to put on your manly generosity and forgive the errors of your  obliged humble servant eliz justice  iv petersburg    may      sir the favors you have formerly bestowed on me are what i can never forget i therefore omit no opportunity of acknowledging them  was i not convinced of your real merit i would not venture to write this for i believe i have now wrote ten letters and have had no answer my friends are equally unkind i must own that one letter i have been favored with from you affords me much satisfaction for i have the vanity to believe you mean what you say i think i may be allowed to complain when my sister cannot find time to write once a year to unhappy me but bad news never wants for carrying for there is a gentleman in england who has wrote to his correspondent here that mr justice is the person who is under confinement and charged with the robbery of the library at cambridge this news arrived about four months ago but my master and lady concealed it from me as they do every thing that they think will give me any uneasiness yet notwithstanding their care it came to my ear and that in a very abrupt manner i was from the unwelcome news much disordered and not willing to believe it true but there was in three news papers immediately following some circumstances that agreed with it now i will leave you to judge what an anxiety of mind i must be in not having any one friend so generous as to inform me of so important an affair i can compare myself to nothing but a person set quick in the ground who sees many things that would preserve him but can procure none of them my leaving england in the manner i did and with a resolution to go abroad i must say had something in it of the daughter of cato were my afflictions nicely considered by a religious and honorable man i am sure he would allow that my conduct was not mean when i was struggling with the rough waves of a turbulent sea now as i am willing nay wish to be judged by the just and upright i appeal to you whether i do not deserve a letter twice a year from old england this is the last i shall write till i hear from you i find so great a decay of my reason that i am apprehensive i shall soon be deprived of my senses but while i remain in them i shall with pleasure own i am  your obliged friend and humble servant eliz justice  letters concerning the manuscripts of william walsh esquire to mr curll sir mr white who i believe i have not the honor to know did very truly inform you when he told you that i had several manuscripts of my uncle walshs by me for to tell you the truth i have a good many but several of them as i take it were written when he was very young others at leisure hours i believe for amusement only and not with any design to publish them indeed most of them are rather sketches or outlines of some design than finished pieces i dare not be instrumental in committing any of them to the press without the approbation and perhaps correction of some very judicious friend  i have not yet seen any of the volumes of mr popes literary correspondence they being published since i left the town but i am in no pain for any thing of mr walshs that can come from that quarter being entirely satisfied that mr pope would not print any thing that he did not know worthy of the memory of his friend whose character as a critic and a man of judgment that gentleman has raised to a very high pitch by the honorable and kind mention he has made of him in his essay on criticism and other his incomparable works  i am sir your most humble servant w bromley worcester aug         ii to mr curll sir i have the favor of yours of the   th of august and likewise one since of the  0th to acknowledge but as i have been a good deal upon the ramble for these three weeks last i hope that will in some measure plead my excuse for not having done it sooner  since i wrote to you last i have been looking over some of the mss you mention and they really seem to be so very incorrect that i cannot possibly prevail with myself to have any of them published the sentiments in some of them i believe are very well and what he would not have been ashamed of but in other respects they are very deficient and besides they have been written so long and in so careless a manner and with such bad ink that a great many of them are scarce legible  i should be obliged to you if you would send me the three volumes of mr popes literary correspondence a fourth volume is published  and when i come to town which i believe will be in a short time i will call upon you and pay for them  i am your humble servant w bromley worcester sept        nb mr white mentioned in the first of these letters is a very worthy gentleman living in worcestershire it was he who gave me the information where i might hear of mr walshs mss and accordingly i wrote to mr bromley concerning them but as he does not think any of them worthy his uncles memory he is highly to be commended for suppressing them i only hereby beg leave to give notice that i have now reprinted a correct and beautiful edition of mr walshs pieces in prose and verse published in his life time which i hope will prove acceptable to the public i am obliged to a lady for the following pieces  sonnets etc by william walsh esquire i phillis we grieve not that nature forming thee has done her part and in every single feature shown the utmost of her art ii but in this it is pretended that a mighty grievance lies that thy heart should be defended though thou woundst us with thy eyes iii

from a summer expedition of four months on account of my health i found a letter from you with an appendix longer than yours from lord bolingbroke i believe there is not a more miserable malady than an unwillingness to write letters to our best friends and a man might be philosopher enough in finding out reasons for it one thing is clear that it shows a mighty difference betwixt friendship and love for a lover as i have heard is always scribbling to his mistress if i could permit my self to believe what your civility makes you say that i am still remembered by my friends in england i am in the right to keep my self here  non sum qualis eram i left you in a period of life when one year does more execution than three at yours to which if you add the dullness of the air and of the people it will make a terrible sum i have no very strong faith in you pretenders to retirement you are not of an age for it nor have gone through either good or bad fortune enough to go into a corner and form conclusions de contemptu mundi and fuga saeculi unless a poet grows weary of too much applause as ministers do of too much weight of business  your happiness is greater than your merit in choosing your favorites so indifferently among either party this you owe partly to your education and partly to your genius employing you in an art in which faction has nothing to do for i suppose virgil and horace are equally read by whigs and tories you have no more to do with the constitution of church and state than a christian at constantinople and you are so much the wiser and the happier because both parties will approve your poetry as long as you are known to be of neither  your notions of friendship are new to me i believe every man is born with his quantum and he cannot give to one without robbing another i very well know to whom i would give the first place in my friendship but they are not in the way i am condemned to another scene and therefore i distribute it in pennyworths to those about me and who displease me least and should do the same to my fellowprisoners if i were condemned to a jayl i can likewise tolerate knaves much better than fools because their knavery does me no hurt in the commerce i have with them which however i own is more dangerous though not so troublesome as that of fools i have often endeavored to establish a friendship among all men of genius and would fain have it done they are seldom above three or four cotemporaries and if they could be united would drive the world before them i think it was so among the poets in the time of augustus but envy and party and pride have hindered it among us i do not include the subalterns of which you are seldom without a large tribe under the name of poets and scriblers i suppose you mean the fools you are content to see sometimes when they happen to be modest which was not frequent among them while i was in the world  i would describe to you my way of living if any method could be called so in this country i choose my companions among those of least consequence and most compliance i read the most trifling books i can find and whenever i write it is upon the most trifling subjects but riding walking and sleeping take up eighteen of the twenty four hours i procrastinate more than i did twenty years ago and have several things to finish which i put off to twenty years hence haec est vita solutorum etc i send you the compliments of a friend of yours who has passed four months this summer with two grave acquaintance at his country house without ever once going to dublin which is but eight miles distant yet when he returns to london i will engage you shall find him as deep in the court of requests the park the opera and the coffeehouse as any man there i am now with him for a few days  you must remember me with great affection to dr arbuthnot mr congreve and gay  i think there are no more eodem tertios between you and me except mr jervas to whose house i address this for want of knowing where you live for it was not clear from your last whether you lodge with lord peterborow or he with you i am ever  your etc  mr pope to dr swift december  0      i find my self the better acquainted with you for a long absence as men are with themselves for a long affliction absence does but hold off a friend to make one see him the more truly i am infinitely more pleased to hear you are coming near us than at any thing you seem to think in my favor an opinion which perhaps has been aggrandizd by the distance or dullness of ireland as objects look larger through a medium of foggs and yet i am infinitely pleased with that too i am much the happier for finding a better thing than our wits our judgments jump in the notion that all scriblers should be past by in silence to vindicate ones self against such nasty slander is much as wise as it was in your countryman when the people imputed a stink to him to prove the contrary by showing his backside so let gildon and philips rest in peace what virgil had to do with maevius that he should wear him upon his sleeve to all eternity i dont know i have been the longer upon this that i may prepare you for the reception both you and your works may possibly meet in england we your true acquaintance will look upon you as a good man and love you others will look upon you as a wit and hate you so you know the worst unless you are as vindicative as virgil or the aforesaid hibernian  i wish as warmly as you for an hospital in which to lodge the despisers of the world only i fear it would be filled wholly like chelsea with maimed soldiers and such as had been disabled in it is service i would rather have those that out of such generous principles as you and i despise it fly in it is face than retire from it not that i have much anger against the great my spleen is at the little rogues of it it would vex one more to be knocked on the head with a pisspot than by a thunderbolt as to great oppressors they are like kites or eagles one expects mischief from them but to be squirted to death as poor wycherley said to me on his deathbed by apothecaries apprentices by the understrappers of undersecretaries to secretaries who were no secretaries  this would provoke as dull a dog as philips himself  so much for enemies now for friends mr l  thinks all this indiscreet the doctor not so he loves mischief the best of any good natured man in england lord b is above trifling when he writes of any thing in this world he is more than mortal if ever he trifles it must be when he turns a divine gay is writing tales for prince william i suppose mr philips will take this very ill for two reasons one that he thinks all childish things belong to him and the other because he will take it ill to be taught that one may write things to a child without being childish what have i more to add but that lord oxford desires earnestly to see you and that many others whom you do not think the worst of will be gratified by it none more be assured than yours etc  to dr arbuthnot july         i thank you for your letter which has all those genuine marks of a good mind by which i have ever distinguished yours and for which i have so long loved you our friendship has been constant because it was grounded on good principles and therefore not only uninterrupted by any distrust by any vanity much less any interest  what you recommend to me with the solemnity of a last request shall have it is due weight with me that disdain and indignation against vice is i thank god the only disdain and indignation i have it is sincere and it will be a lasting one but sure it is as impossible to have a just abhorrence of vice without hating the vicious as to bear a true love for virtue without loving the good to reform and not to chastise i am afraid is impossible and that the best precepts as well as the best laws would prove of small use if there were no examples to enforce them to attack vices in the abstract without touching persons may be safe fighting indeed but it is fighting with shadows general propositions are obscure misty and uncertain compared with plain full and home examples precepts only apply to our reason which in most men is but weak examples are pictures and strike the senses nay raise the passions and call in those the strongest and most general of all motives to the aid of reformation every vicious man makes the case his own and that is the only way by which such men can be affected much less deterred so that to chastise is to reform the only sign by which i found my writings ever did any good or had any weight has been that they raised the anger of bad men and my greatest comfort and encouragement to proceed has been to see that those who have no shame and no fear of any thing else have appeared touched by my satires  as to your kind concern for my safety i can guess what occasions it at this time some characters i have drawn are such that if there be any who deserve em it is evidently a service to mankind to point those men out yet such as if all the world gave them none i think will own they take to themselves but if they should those of whom all the world think in such a manner must be men i cannot fear such in particular as have the meanness to do mischiefs in the dark have seldom the courage to justify them in the face of day the talents that make a cheat or a whisperer are not the same that qualify a man for an insulter and as to private villainy it is not so safe to join in an assassination as in a libel i will consult my safety to far as i think becomes a prudent man but not so far as to omit any thing which i think becomes an honest one as to personal attacks beyond the law every man is liable to them as for danger within the law i am not guilty enough to fear any for the good opinion of all the world i know it is not to be had for that of worthy men i hope i shall not forfeit it for that of the great or those in power i may wish i had it but if through misrepresentations too common about persons in that station i have it not i shall be sorry but not miserable in the want of it  it is certain much freer satyrists than i have enjoyed the encouragement and protection of the princes under whom they lived augustus and maecenas made horace their companion though he had been in arms on the side of brutus and allow me to remark it was out of the suffering party too that they favored and distinguished virgil you will not suspect me of comparing my self with virgil and horace nay even with another courtfavourite boileau i have always been too modest to imagine my panegyrics were incense worthy of a court and that i hope will be thought the true reason why i have never offered any i would only have observed that it was under the greatest princes and best ministers that moral satyrists were most encouraged and that then poets exercised the same jurisdiction over the follies as historians did over the vices of men it may also be worth considering whether augustus himself makes the greater figure in the writings of the former or of the latter and whether nero and domitian do not appear as ridiculous for their false taste and affectation in persius and juvenal as odious for their bad government in tacitus and suetonius in the first of these reigns it was that horace was protected and caressed and in the latter that lucan was put to death and juvenal banished  i would not have said so much but to show you my whole heart on this subject and to convince you i am deliberately bent to perform that request which you make your last to me and to perform it with temper justice and resolution as your approbation being the testimony of a sound head and an honest heart does greatly confirm me herein i wish you may live to see the effect it may hereafter have upon me in something more deserving of that approbation but if it be the will of god which i know will also be yours that we must separate i hope it will be better for you than it can be for me you are fitter to live or to die than any man i know adieu my dear friend and may god preserve your life easy or make your death happy  letters to and from bishop atterbury december      i return your preface mr popes general preface to his poems vol i printed       which i have read twice with pleasure the modesty and good sense there is in it must please every one who reads it and since there is nothing that can offend i see not why you should balance a moment about printing it  always provided that there is nothing said there which you may have occasion to unsay hereafter of which you your self are the best and the only judge this is my sincere opinion which i give because you ask it and which i would not give though asked but to a man i value as much as i do you being sensible how improper it is on many accounts for me to interpose in things of this nature which i never understood well and now understand somewhat less than ever i did but i can deny you nothing especially since you have had the goodness often and patiently to hear what i have said against rhyme and in behalf of blank verse with little discretion perhaps but i am sure without the least prejudice being my self equally incapable of writing well in either of those ways and leaning therefore to neither side of the question but as the appearance of reason inclines me forgive me this error if it be one an error of above thirty years standing and which therefore i shall be very loath to part with in other matters which relate to polite writing i shall seldom differ from you or if i do shall i hope have the prudence to conceal my opinion i am as much as i ought to be that is as much as any man can be  yours etc  the bishop of rochester to mr pope bromley nov        i have nothing to say to you on that melancholy subject with an account of which the printed papers have furnished me but what you have already said to your self  when you have paid the debt of tenderness you owe to the memory of a father i doubt not but you will turn your thoughts toward improving that accident to your own ease and happiness you have it now in your power to pursue that method of thinking and living which you like best give me leave if i am not a little too early in my applications of this kind to congratulate you upon it and to assure you that there is no man living who wishes you better or would be more pleased to contribute any way to your satisfaction or service  i return you your milton which upon collation i find to be revised and augmented in several places as the title page of my third the third edition of miltons paradise lost was revised and augmented by the author and printed      though all the writers of his life make him die      edition pretends it to be when i see you next i will show you the several passages altered and added by the author beside what you mentioned to me  i protest to you this last perusal of him has given me such new degrees i will not say of pleasure but of admiration and astonishment that i look upon the sublimity of homer and the majesty of virgil with somewhat less reverence than i used to do i challenge you with all your partiality to show me in the first of these any thing equal to the allegory of sin and death either as to the greatness and justness of the invention or the height and beauty of the coloring what i looked upon as a rant of barrows i now begin to think a serious truth and could almost venture to set my hand to it haec quicunque legit tantum cecinisse putabit maeoniden ranas virgilium culices but more of this when we meet when i left the town the d of buckingham continued so ill that he received no messages oblige me so far as to let me know how he does at the same time i shall know how you do and that will be a double satisfaction to your etc  the answer nov  0      my lord i am truly obliged by your kind condolance on my fathers death and the desire you express that i should improve this accident to my advantage i know your lordships friendship to me is so extensive that you include in that wish both my spiritual and my temporal advantage and it is what i owe to that friendship to open my mind unreservedly to you on this head it is true i have lost a parent for whom no gains i could make would be any equivalent but that was not my only tie i thank god another still remains and long may it remain of the same tender nature genitrix est mihi  and excuse me if i say with euryalus  nequeam lacrymas perferre parentis a rigid divine may call it a carnal tie but sure it is a virtuous one at least i am more certain that it is a duty of nature to preserve a good parents life and happiness than i am of any speculative point whatever  ignaram hujus quodcunque pericli hanc ego nunc linquam for she my lord would think this separation more grievous than any other and i for my part know as little as poor euryalus did of the success of such an adventure for an adventure it is and no small one in spite of the most positive divinity whether the change would be to my spiritual advantage god only knows this i know i mean as well in the religion i now profess as i can possibly ever do in any other can a man who thinks so justify a change even if he thought both equally good to such an one the part of joining with any one body of christians might perhaps be easy but i think it would not be so to renounce the other  your lordship has formerly advised me to read the best books of controversies between the churches shall i tell you a secret i did so at fourteen years old for i loved reading and my father had no other books there was a collection of all that had been written on both sides in the reign of king james the second i warmed my head with them and the consequence was that i found my self a papist and a protestant by turns according to the last book i read i am afraid most seekers are in the same case and when they stop they are not so properly converted as outwitted you see how little glory you would gain by my conversion and after all i verily believe your lordship and i are both of the same religion if we were thoroughly understood by one another and that all honest and reasonable christians would be so if they did but talk enough together every day and had nothing to do together but to serve god and live in peace with their neighbor  as to the temporal side of the question i can have no dispute with you it is certain all the beneficial circumstances of life and all the shining ones lie on the part you would invite me to but if i could bring myself to fancy what i think you do but fancy that i have any talents for active life i want health for it and besides it is a real truth i have less inclination if possible than ability contemplative life is not only my scene but it is my habit too i begun my life where most people end theirs with a disrelish of all that the world calls ambition i dont know why it is called so for to me it always seemed to be rather stooping than climbing i will tell you my politic and religious sentiments in a few words in my politics i think no farther than how to preserve the peace of my life in any government under which i live nor in my religion than to preserve the peace of my conscience in any church with which i communicate i hope all churches and all governments are so far of god as they are rightly understood and rightly administered and where they are or may be wrong i leave it to god alone to mend or reform them which whenever he does it must be by greater instruments than i am i am not a papist for i renounce the temporal invasions of the papal power and detest their arrogated authority over princes or states i am a catholic in the strictest sense of the word if i was born under an absolute prince i would be a quiet subject but i thank god i was not i have a due sense of the excellence of the british constitution in a word the things i have always wished to see are not a roman catholic or a french catholic or a spanish catholic but a true catholic and not a king of whigs or a king of tories but a king of england which god of his mercy grant his present majesty may be and all future majestys you see my lord i end like a preacher but this is sermo ad clerum not ad populum believe me with infinite obligation and sincere thanks ever  your etc  mr pope to the bishop of rochester sept       0 i hope you have some time ago received the sulphur and the two volumes of mr gay as instances how small ones soever that i wish you both health and diversion what i now send for your perusal i shall say nothing of not to forestall by a single word what you promised to say upon that subject your lordship may criticize from virgil to these tales as solomon wrote of every thing from the cedar to the hysop i have some cause since i last waited on you at bromley to look upon you as a prophet in that retreat from whom oracles are to be had were mankind wise enough to go thither to consult you the fate of the south sea scheme has sooner than i expected verified what you told me most people thought the time would come but no man prepared for it no man considered it would come like a thief in the night exactly as it happens in the case of our death methinks god has punished the avaritious as he often punishes sinners in their own way in the very sin itself the thirst of gain was their crime that thirst continued became their punishment and ruin as for the few who have the good fortune to remain with half of what they imagined they had among whom is your humble servant i would have them sensible of their felicity and convinced of the truth of old hesiods maxim who after half his estate was swallowed up by the directors of those days resolved that half to be more than the whole  does not the fate of these people put you in mind of two passages one in job the other from the psalmist  men shall groan out of the city and hiss them out of their place  they have dreamed out their dream and awaking have found nothing in their hands  indeed the universal poverty which is the consequence of universal avarice and which will fall hardest upon the guiltless and industrious part of mankind is truly lamentable the universal deluge of the south sea contrary to the old deluge has drowned all except a few unrighteous men but it is some comfort to me that i am not one of them even though i were to survive and rule the world by it i am much pleased with a thought of dr arbuthnots he says the government and south sea company have only locked up the money of the people upon conviction of their lunacy as is usual in case of lunatics and intend to restore em as much as may be fit for such people as fast as they shall see em return to their senses  the latter part of your letter does me so much honor and shows me so much kindness that i must both be proud and pleased in a great degree but i assure you my lord much more the last than the first for i certainly know and feel in my own heart which truly respects you that there may be a ground for your partiality one way but i find not the least symptoms in my head of any foundation for the other in a word the best reason i know for my being pleased is that you continue your favor toward me the best i know for being proud would be that you might cure me of it for i have found you to be such a physician as does not only repair but improve i am with the sincerest esteem andacknowledgment your etc  from the bishop of rochester the arabian tales and mr gays books i received not till monday night together with your letter for which i thank you i have had a fit of the gout upon me ever since i returned hither from westminster on saturday night last it has found it is way into my hands as well as legs so that i have been utterly incapable of writing this is the first letter that i have ventured upon which will be written i fear vaccilantibus literis as tully says tyros letters were after his recovery from an illness what i said to you in mine about the monument was intended only to quicken not to alarm you it is not worth your while to know what i meant by it but when i see you you shall i hope you may be at the deanery toward the end of october by which time i think of settling there for the winter what do you think of some such short inscription as this in latin which may in a few words say all that is to be said of dryden and yet nothing more than he deserves johanni drydeno cui poesis anglicana vim suam ac veneres debet et siqua in posterum augebitur laud est adhuc debitura honoris ergo p etc   to show you that i am as much in earnest in the affair as you your self something i will send you too of this kind in english if your design holds of fixing drydens name only below and his busto above may not lines like these be engraved just under the name this sheffield raised to drydens ashes just here fixed his name and there his laureled bust what else the muse in marble might express is known already praise would make him less or thus  more needs not where acknowledged merits reign praise is impertinent and censure vain this you will take as a proof of my zeal at least though it be none of my talent in poetry when you have read it over i will forgive you if you should not once in your life time again think of it  and now sir for your arabian tales ill as i have been almost ever since they came to hand i have read as much of them as ever i shall read while i live indeed they do not please my taste they are writ with so romantic an air and allowing for the difference of eastern manners are yet upon any supposition that can be made of so wild and absurd a contrivance at least to my northern understanding that i have not only no pleasure but no patience in perusing them they are to me like the odd paintings on indian screens which at first glance may surprise and please a little but when you fix your eye intently upon them they appear so extravagant disproportioned and monstrous that they give a judicious eye pain and make him seek for relief from some other object they may furnish the mind with some new images but i think the purchase is made at too great an expense for to read those two volumes through liking them as little as i do would be a terrible penance and to read them with pleasure would be dangerous on the other side because of the infection i will never believe that you have any keen relish of them till i find you write worse than you do which i dare say i never shall who that petit de la croise is the pretended author of them i cannot tell but observing how full they are in the descriptions of dress furniture etc i cannot help thinking them the product of some womans imagination and believe me i would do any thing but break with you rather than be bound to read em over with attention  i am sorry that i was so true a prophet in respect of the south sea sorry i mean as far as your loss is concerned for in the general i ever was and still am of opinion that had the project taken root and flourished it would by degrees have overturned our constitution three or four hundred millions was such a weight that whichsoever way it had leaned it must have borne down all before it  but of the dead we must speak gently and therefore as mr dryden says somewhere peace be to it is manes  let me add one reflection to make you easy in your ill luck had you got all that you have lost beyond what you ventured consider that your superfluous gains would have sprung from the ruin of several families that now want necessaries a thought under which a good and a good natured man that grew rich by such means could not i persuade my self be perfectly easy adieu and believe me ever your etc  from the bishop of rochester march    you are not your self gladder you are well than i am especially since i can please my self with the thought that when you had lost your health elsewhere you recovered it here may these lodgings never treat you worse nor you at any time have less reason to be fond of them  i thank you for the sight of your epitaph on mr harcourt verses and with the freedom of an honest though perhaps injudicious friend must tell you that though i could like some of them if they were any bodys but yours yet as they are yours and to be owned as such i can scarce like any of them not but that the four first lines are good especially the second couplet and might if followed by four others as good give reputation to a writer of a less established fame but from you i expect something of a more perfect kind and which the oftner it is read the more it will be admired when you barely exceed other writers you fall much beneath your self it is your misfortune now to write without a rival and you may be tempted by that means to be more careless than you would otherwise be in your composures  thus much i could not forbear saying though i have a motion of consequence in the house of lords to day and must prepare for it i am even with you for your ill paper for i write upon worse having no other at hand i wish you the continuance of your health most heartily and am ever  yours etc i have sent dr arbuthnot the latin ms of huetius left after his death which i could not find when you left me and am so angry at the writer for his design and his manner of executing it that i could hardly forbear sending him a line of virgil along with it the chief reasoner of that philosophic farce is a galloligur as he is called  what that means in english or french i cannot say  but all he says is in so loose and slippery and trickish a way of reasoning that i could not forbear applying the passage of virgil to him vane ligur frustraque animis elate superbis nequicquam patrias tentasti lubricus arts   to be serious i hate to see a book gravely written and in all the forms of argumentation which proves nothing and which says nothing and endeavors only to put us into a way of distrusting our own faculties and doubting whether the marks of truth and falsehood can in any case be distinguished from each other could that blessed point be made out as it is a contradiction in terms to say it can we should then be in the most uncomfortable and wretched state in the world and i would in that case be glad to exchange my reason with a dog for his instinct to morrow    lord chancellor harcourt to mr pope december        i cannot but suspect my self of being very unreasonable in begging you once more to review the enclosed your friendship draws this trouble on you i may freely own to you that my tenderness makes me exceeding hard to be satisfied with any thing which can be said on such an unhappy subject i caused the latin epitaph to be as often altered before i could approve it  when once your epitaph is set up there can be no alteration of it it will remain a perpetual monument of your friendship and i assure myself you will so settle it that it shall be worthy of you i doubt whether the word denied in the third line will justly admit of that construction which it ought to bear viz renounced deserted etc denied is capable in my opinion of having an ill sense put upon it as too great easiness or more good nature than a wise man ought to have i very well remember you told me you could scarce mend those two lines and therefore i can scarce expect your forgiveness for my desiring you to reconsider them harcourt stands dumb and pope is forced to speak i cannot perfectly at least without farther discoursing you reconcile my self to the first part of that line and the word forced which was my own and i persuade my self for that reason only submitted to by you seems to carry too doubtful a construction for an epitaph which as i apprehend ought as easily to be understood as read i shall acknowledge it as a very particular favor if at your best leisure you will peruse the enclosed and vary it if you think it capable of being amended and let me see you any morning next week  i am etc epitaph as it was erected    0 to this sad shrine whoever thou art draw near here lies the friend most loved the son most dear who never knew joy but friendship might divide or gave his father grief but when he died how vain is reason eloquence how weak if pope must tell what harcourt cannot speak o let thy once loved friend inscribe thy stone and with a fathers sorrow mix his own   the bishop of rochester to mr pope sept         i am now confined to my bedchamber and to the mattedroom wherein i am writing seldom venturing to be carried down even into the parlour to dinner unless when company to whom i cannot excuse my self comes which i am not ill pleased to find is now very seldom this is my case in the sunny part of the year what must i expect when  inversum contristat aquarius annum   if these things be done in the green tree what shall be done in the dry excuse me for employing a sentence of scripture on this occasion i apply it very seriously one thing relieves me a little under the ill prospect i have of spending my time at the deanery this winter that i shall have the opportunity of seeing you oftner though i am afraid you will have little pleasure in seeing me there so much for my ill state of health which i had not touched on had not your friendly letter been so full of it one civil thing that you say in it made me think you had been reading mr waller and possessed of that image at the end of his copy a la malade had you not bestowed it on one who has no right to the least part of the character if you have not read the verses lately i am sure you remember em because you forget nothing with such a grace you entertain and look with such contempt on pain etc   i mention them not on the account of that couplet but one that follows which ends with the very same rhimes and words appear and clear that the couplet but one after that does  and therefore in my waller there is a various reading of the first of these couplets for there it runs thus so lightenings in a stormy air scorch more than when the sky is fair   you will say that i am not very much in pain nor very busy when i can relish these amusements and you will say true for at present i am in both these respects very easy  i had not strength enough to attend mr prior to his grave else i would have done it to have showed his friends that i had forgot and forgiven what he wrote on me alluding to this epigram on his burying the duke of buckinghamshire i have no hopes  the duke he says and dies in sure and certain hopes  the prelate cries of these two learned peers i prithee say man who is the lying knave the priest or layman the duke he stands an infidel confessed he is our dear brother  quoth the lordly priest the duke though knave still brother dear he cries and who can say the reverend prelate lies   he is buried as he desired at the feet of spenser and i will take care to make good in every respect what i said to him when living particularly as to the triplet to me twas given to die to thee it is given to live alas one moment sets us even mark low impartial is the will of heaven  he wrote for his own epitaph which while we were in good terms i promised him should never appear on his tomb while i was dean of westminster  i am pleased to find you have so much pleasure and which is the foundation of it so much health at lord bathursts may both continue till i see you may my lord have as much satisfaction in building the house in the wood and using it when built as you have in designing it i cannot send a wish after him that means him more happiness and yet i am sure i wish him as much as he wishes himself  i am etc  from the same bromley oct         notwithstanding i write this on sunday evening to acknowledge the receipt of yours this morning yet i foresee it will not reach you till wednesday morning and before set of sun that day i hope to reach my winter quarters at the deanery i hope did i say i recall that word for it implies desire and god knows that is far from being the case for i never part from this place but with regret though i generally keep here what mr cowley calls the worst of company in the world my own and see either none beside or what is worse than none some of the arrii of sebosi of my neighborhood characters which tully paints so well in one of his epistles and complains of the too civil but impertinent interruption they gave him in his retirement since i have named those gentlemen and the book is not far from me i will turn to the place and by pointing it out to you give you the pleasure of perusing the epistle which is a very agreeable one if my memory does not fail me  i am surpised to find that my lord bathurst and you are parted so soon he has been sick i know of some late transactions but should that sickness continue still in some measure i prophecy it will be quite off by the beginning of november a letter or two from his londonfriends and a surfeit of solitude will soon make him change his resolution and his quarters i vow to you i could live here with pleasure all the winter and be contented with hearing no more news than the londonjournal or some such trifling paper affords me did not the duty of my place require absolutely require my attendance at westminster where i hope the prophet will now and then remember he has a bed and a candlestic in short i long to see you and hope you will come if not a day yet at least an hour sooner to town than you intended in order to afford me that satisfaction i am now i thank god as well as ever i was in my life except that i can walk scarce at all without crutches and i would willingly compound the matter with the gout to be no better could i hope to be no worse but that is a vain thought i expect a new attack long before christmas let me see you therefore while i am in a condition to relish you before the days and the nights come when i shall and must say i have no pleasure in them  i will bring your small volume of pastorals along with me that you may not be discouraged from lending me books when you find me so punctual in returning them shakespeare shall bear it company and be put into your hands as clear and as fair as it came out of them though you i think have been dabling here and there with the text i have had more reverence for the writer and the printer and left every thing standing just as i found it however i thank you for the pleasure you have given me in putting me upon reading him once more before i die  i believe i shall scarce repeat that pleaany more having other work to do and other things to think of but none that will interfere with the offices of friendship in the exchange of which with you sir i hope to live and die  yours etc ps mr addisons works came to my hands yesterday i cannot but think it a very odd set of incidents that the book should be dedicated by mr addison a dead man mr crsggs to a dead man and even that the new lord warwick patron to whom mr tickell chose to inscribe his verses should be dead also before they were published had i been in the editors place i should have been a little apprehensive for my self under a thought that every one who had any hand in that work was to die before the publication of it you see when i am conversing with you i know not how to give over till the very bottom of the paper admonishes me once more to bid you adieu    from the bishop of rochester feb          permit me dear sir to break into your retirement and to desire of you a complete copy of those verses on mr addison an imperfect copy was got out very much to the authors surprise who never would give any  send me also your last resolution which shall punctually be observed in relation to my giving out any copy of it for i am again solicited by another lord to whom i have given the same answer as formerly no small piece of your writing has been ever sought after so much it has pleased every man without exception to whom it has been read since you now therefore know where your real strength lies i hope you will not suffer that talent to lie unemployd for my part i should be so glad to see you finish something of that kind that i could be content to be a little sneerd at in a line or so for the sake of the pleasure i should have in reading the rest i have talked my sense of this matter to you once or twice and now i put it under my hand that you may see it is my deliberate opinion what weight that may have with you i cannot say but it pleases me to have an opportunity of showing you how well i wish you and how true a friend i am to your fame which i desire may grow every day and in every kind of writing to which you shall please to turn your pen not but that i have some little interest in the proposal as i shall be known to have been acquainted with a man that was capable of excelling in such different manners and did such honor to his country and language and yet was not displeased sometimes to read what was written by his humble servant  mr pope to bishop atterbury march          i was disappointed much more than those who commonly use that phrase on such occasions in missing you at the deanery where i lay solitary two nights indeed i truly partake in any degree of concern that affects you and i wish every thing may succeed as you desire in your own family and in that which i think you no less account your own and is no less your family the whole world for i take you to be one of the true friends of it and to your power it is protector though the noise and daily bustle for the public be now over i dare say a good man is still tendering it is welfare as the sun in the winter when seeming to retire from the world is preparing benedictions and warmth for a better season no man wishes your lordship more quiet more tranquillity than i who know you should understand the value of it but i dont wish you a jot less concerned or less active than you are in all sincere and therefore warm desires for public good  i beg the kindness and it is for that chiefly i trouble you with this letter to favor me with notice as soon as you return to london that i may come and make you a proper visit of a day or two for hitherto i have not been your visiter but your lodger and i accuse my self of it i have now no earthly thing to oblige my being in town a point of no small satisfaction to me but the best reason the seeing a friend as long my lord as you will let me call you so and i dare say you will till i forfeit what i think i never shall my veracity and integrity i shall esteem my self fortunate in spite of the southsea poetry popery and poverty  i cannot tell you how sorry i am you should be troubled anew by any sort of people i heartily wish quod superest ut tibi vivas  that you may teach me how to do the same who without any real impediment to acting and living rightly do act and live as foolishly as if i were a great man  i am etc  from the bishop of rochester march          as a visitant a lodger a friend or under what other denomination soever you are always welcome to me and will be more so i hope every day that we live for to tell you the truth i like you as i like my self best when we have both of us least business it has been my fate to be engaged in it much and often by the stations in which i was placed but god that knows my heart knows i never loved it and am still less in love with it than ever as i find less temptation to act with any hope of success if i am good for any thing it is in angulo cum libello and yet a good part of my time has been spent and perhaps must still be spent far otherwise for i will never while i have health be wanting to my duty in any post or in any respect how little soever i may like my employment and how hopeless soever i may be in the discharge of it  in the mean time the judicious world is pleased to think that i delight in work which i am obliged to undergo and aim at things which i from my heart despise let them think as they will so i might be at liberty to act as i will and spend my time in such a manner as is most agreeable to me i cannot say i do so now for i am here without any books and if i had them could not use them to my satisfaction while my mind is taken up in a more melancholy in his ladys last sickness manner and how long or how little a while it may be so taken up god only knows and to his will i implicitly resign myself in every thing  i am etc  mr pope to the bishop of rochester march          i am extremely sensible of the repeated favor of your kind letters and your thoughts of me in absence even among thoughts of much nearer concern to youself on the one hand and of much more importance to the world on the other which cannot but engage you at this juncture i am very certain of your good will and of the warmth which is in you inseparable from it  your remembrance of twitenham is a fresh instance of that partiality i hope the advance of the fine season will set you upon your legs enough to enable you to get into my garden where i will carry you up a mount to show you in a point of view the glory of my little kingdom if you approve it i shall be in danger to boast like nebuchadnezzar of the things i have made and to be turned to converse not with the beasts of the field but with the birds of the grove which i shall take to be no great punishment for indeed i heartily despise the ways of the world and most of the great ones of it o keep me innoceut make others great and you may judge how comfortably i am strengthened in this opinion when such as your lordship bear testimony to it is vanity andemptiness tinnit inane est with the picture of one ringing on the globe with his finger is the best thing i have the luck to remember in that great poet quarles not that i forget the devil at bowls which i know to be your lordships favorite cut as well as favorite diversion  the situation here is pleasant and the view rural enough to humor the most retired and agree with the most contemplative good air solitary groves and sparing diet sufficient to make you fancy your self what you are in temperance though elevated into a greater figure by your station one of the fathers of the desert here you may think to use an authors words whom you so justly prefer to all his followers that you will receive them kindly though taken from his worst work that in elijahs banquet you partake or sit a guest with daniel at his pulse   i am sincerely free with you as you desire i should and approve of your not having your coach here for if you would see lord c carteret or any body else i have another chariot besides that little one you laughed at when you compared me to homer in a nutshell but if you would be entirely private no body shall know any thing of the matter believe me my lord no man is with more perfect acquiescence nay with more willing acquiescence not even any of your own sons of the church  your obedient etc  from the bishop of rochester april        under all the leisure in the world i have no leisure no stomach to write to you the gradual approaches of death are before my eyes i am convinced that it must be so and yet make a shift to flatter my self sometimes with the thought that it may possibly be otherwise and that very thought though it is directly contrary to my reason does for a few moments make me easy  however not easy enough in good earnest to think of any thing but the melancholy object that employs them therefore wonder not that i do not answer your kind letter i shall answer it too soon i fear by accepting your friendly invitation when i do so no conveniences will be wanting for i will see no body but you and your mother and the servants visits to statesmen always were to me and are now more than ever insipid things let the men that expect that wish to thrive by them pay them that homage i am free when i want them they shall hear of me at their doors and when they want me i shall be sure to hear of them at mine but probably they will despise me so much and i shall court them so little that we shall both of us keep our distance  when i come to you it is in order to be with you only a president of the council or a star and garter will make no more impression upon my mind at such a time than the hearing of a bagpipe or the sight of a puppetshow i have said to greatness sometime ago  tuas tibi res habeto egomet curabo meas the time is not far off when we shall all be upon the level and i am resolved for my part to anticipate that time and be upon the level with them now for he is so that neither seeks nor wants them let them have more virtue and less pride and then i will court them as much as any body but till they resolve to distinguish themselves some way else than by their outward trappings i am determined and i think i have a right to be as proud as they are though i trust in god my pride is neither of so odious a nature as theirs nor of so mischievous a consequence  i know not how i have fallen into this train of thinking  when i sat down to write i intended only to excuse my self for not writing and to tell you that the time drew nearer and nearer when i must dislodge i am preparing for it for i am at this moment building a vault in the abbey for me and mine twas to be in the abbey because of my relation to the place but it is at the west door of it as far from kings and caesars as the space will admit of  i know not but i may step to town tomorrow to see how the work goes forward but if i do i shall return hither in the evening i would not have given you the trouble of this letter but that they tell me it will cost you nothing and that our privilege of franking one of the most valuable we have left is again allowed us  yours etc  from the bishop of rochester bromley may         i had much ado to get hither last night the water being so rough that the ferrymen were unwilling to venture the first thing i saw this morning after my eyes were open was your letter for the freedom and kindness of which i thank you let all compliments be laid aside between us for the future and depend upon me as your faithful friend in all things within my power as one that truly values you and wishes you all manner of happiness i thank you and mrs pope for my kind reception which has left a pleasing impression upon me that will not soon be effaced  lord bolingbroke has pressed me terribly to see him at dawley and told me in a manner betwixt kindness and resentment that it is but a few miles beyond twitenham  i have but a little time left and a great deal to do in it and must expect that ill health will render a good share of it useless and therefore what is likely to be left at the foot of the account ought by me to be cherished and not thrown away in compliments you know the motto of my sundial vivite ait fugio i will as far as i am able follow it is advice and cut off all unnecessary avocations and amusements there are those that intend to employ me this winter in a way i do not like if they persist in their intentions i must apply my self to the work they cut out for me as well as i can but withal that shall not hinder me from employing myself also in a way which they do not like the givers of trouble one way shall have their share of it another that at last they may be induced to let me be quiet and live to my self with the few the very few friends i like for that is the point the single point i now aim at though i know the generality of the world who are unacquainted with my intentions and views think the very reverse of this character belongs to me i dont know how i have rambled into this account of my self when i sat down to write i had no thought of making that any part of my letter  you might have been sure without my telling you that my right hand is at ease else i should not have overflowed at this rate and yet i have not done for there is a kind intimation at the end of yours which i understood because it seems to tend toward employing me in something that is agreeable to you pray explain your self and believe that you have not an acquaintance in the world that would be more in earnest on such an occasion than i for i love you as well as esteem you  all the while i have been writing pain and a fine thrush have been severally endeavoring to call off my attention but both in vain nor should i yet part with you but that the turning over a new leaf frights me a little and makes me resolve to break through a new temptation before it has taken too fast hold on me  i am etc  from the same june         you have generally written first after our parting i will now be beforehand with you in my enquiries how you got home and how you do and whether you met with lord  and delivered my civil reproach to him in the manner i desired i suppose you did not because i have heard nothing either from you or from him on that head as i suppose i might have done if you had found him  i am sick of these men of quality and the more so the oftener i have any business to transact with them they look upon it as one of their distinguishing privileges not to be punctual in any business of how great importance soever nor to set other people at ease with the loss of the least part of their own this conduct of his vexes me but to what purpose or how can i alter it  i long to see the original ms of milton but dont know how to come at it without your repeated assistance  i hope you will not utterly forget what passed in the coach about sampson agonistes i shall not press you as to time but sometime or other i wish you would review and polish that piece if upon a new perusal of it which i desire you to make you think as i do that it is written in the very spirit of the ancients it deserves your care and is capable of being improved with little trouble into a perfect model and standard of tragic poetry  always allowing for it is being a story taken out of the bible which is an objection that at this time of day i know is not to be got over  i am etc  mr pope to the bishop of rochester july    i have been as constantly at twitenham as your lordship has at bromley ever since you saw lord bathurst at the time of the duke of marlboroughs funeral i intend to lie at the deanery and moralize one evening with you on the vanity of human glory   the duchesss letter concerns me nearly and you know it who know all my thoughts without disguise i must keep clear of flattery i will and as this is an honest resolution i dare hope your lordship will not be so unconcerned for my keeping it as not to assist me in so doing i beg therefore you would represent thus much at least to her grace that as to the fear she seems touched with that the dukes memory should have no advantage but what he must give himself without being beholden to any one friend your lordship may certainly and agreeably to your character both of rigid honor and christian plainness tell her that no man can have any other advantage and that all offerings of friends in such a case pass for nothing be but so good as to confirm what i have represented to her that an inscription in the ancient way plain pompous and yet modest will be the most uncommon and therefore the most distinguishing manner of doing it and so i hope she will be satisfied the dukes honor be preserved and my integrity also which is too sacred a thing to be forfeited in consideration of any little or what people of quality may call great honor or distinction whatever which those of their rank can bestow on one of mine and which indeed they are apt to overrate but never so much as when they imagine us under any obligation to say one untrue word in their favor  i can only thank you my lord for the kind transition you make from common business to that which is the only real business of every reasonable creature indeed i think more of it than you imagine though not so much as i ought i am pleased with those latin verses extremely which are so very good that i thought em yours till you called em an horatian cento and then i recollected the disjecti membra poetae i will not pretend i am so totally in those sentiments which you compliment me with as i yet hope to be you tell me i have them as the civillest method to put me in mind how much it fits me to have em i ought first to prepare my mind by a better knowledge even of good profane writers especially the moralists etc before i can be worthy of tasting that supreme of books and sublime of all writings in which as in all the intermediate ones you may if your friendship and charity toward me continue so far be the best guide to  your etc  from the bishop of rochester july  0      i have written to the duchess just as you desired and referred her to our meeting in town for a further account of it i have done it the rather because your opinion in the case is sincerely mine and if it had not been so you your self should not have induced me to give it whether and how far she will acquiesce in it i cannot say especially in a case where she thinks the dukes honor concerned but should she seem to persist a little at present her good sense which i depend upon will afterward satisfy her that we are in the right  i go to morrow to the deanery and i believe i shall stay there till i have said dust to dust and shut up that this was the funeral of the duke of marlborough at which the bishop officiated as dean of westminster in aug      last scene of pompous vanity  it is a great while for me to stay there at this time of the year and i know i shall often say to my self while i am expecting the funeral o rus quanda ego te aspiciam quandoque licebit ducere sollocitae jucunda oblivia vitae   in that case i shall fancy i hear the ghost of the dead thus entreating me at tu sacratae ne parce malignus arenae ossibus and capiti inhumato particulam dare  quanquam festinas non est mora longa licebit injecto ter pulvere curras there is an answer for me some where in hamlet to this request which you remember though i dont  poor ghost thou shall be satisfied  or something like it however that be take care you do not fail in your appointment that the company of the living may make me some amends for my attendance on the dead  i know you will be glad to hear that i am well i should always could i always be here   sed me imperiosa trahit proserpina vive valeque   you are the first man i sent to this morning and the last man i desire to converse with this evening though at twenty miles distance from you te veniente die te decedente requiro   from the bishop of rochester the tower april  0      dear sir i thank you for all instances of your friendship both before and since my misfortunes a little time will complete them and separate you and me for ever but in what part of the world soever i am i will live mindful of your sincere kindness to me and will please my self with the thought that i still live in your esteem and affection as much as ever i did and that no accidents of life no distance of time or place will alter you in that respect it never can me who have loved and valued you ever since i knew you and shall not fail to do it when i am not allowed to tell you so as the case will soon be give my faithful services to dr arbuthnot and thanks for what he sent me which was much to the purpose in a case that is already determined let him know my defense will be such that neither my friends need blush for me nor will my enemies have great occasion of triumph though sure of the victory i shall want his advice before i go abroad in many things but i question whether i shall be permitted to see him or any body but such as are absolutely necessary toward the dispatch of my private affairs if so god bless you both and may no part of the ill fortune that attends me ever pursue either of you i know not but i may call upon you at my hearing to say somewhat about my way of spending my time at the deanery which did not seem calculated toward managing plots and conspiracies but of that i shall consider  you and i have spent many hours together upon much pleasanter subjects and that i may preserve the old custom i shall not part with you now till i have closed this letter with three lines of milton which you will i know readily and not without some degree of concern apply to your ever affectionate etc some natural tears he dropped but wiped them soon the world was all before him where to choose his place of rest and providence his guide   the answer april  0      it is not possible to express what i think and what i feel only this that i have thought and felt for nothing but you for some time past and shall think of nothing so long for the time to come the greatest comfort i had was an intention which i would have made practicable to have attended you in your journey to which i had brought that person to consent who only could have hindered me by a tie which though it may be more tender i do not think more strong than that of friendship but i fear there will be no way left me to tell you this great truth that i remember you that i love you that i am grateful to you that i entirely esteem and value you no way but that one which needs no open warrant to authorize it or secret conveyance to secure it which no bills can preclude and no kings prevent a way that can reach to any part of the world where you may be where the very whisper or even the wish of a friend must not be heard or even suspected by this way i dare to tell my esteem and affection for you to your enemies in the gates and you and they and their sons may hear of it  you prove your self my lord to know me for the friend i am in judging that the manner of your defense and your reputation by it is a point of the highest concern to me and assuring me it shall be such that none of your friends shall blush for you let me further prompt you to do your self the best and most lasting justice the instruments of your fame to posterity will be in your own hands may it not be that providence has appointed you to some great and useful work and calls you to it this severe way you may more eminently and more effectually serve the public even now than in the stations you have so honorably filled think of tully bacon and clarendon is it not the latter the disgraced part of their lives which you most envy and which you would choose to have lived  i am tenderly sensible of the wish you express that no part of your misfortune may pursue me but god knows i am every day less and less fond of my native country so torn as it is by partyrage and begin to consider a friend in exile as a friend in death one gone before where i am not unwilling nor unprepared to follow after and where however various or uncertain the roads and voyages of another world may be i cannot but entertain a pleasing hope that we may meet again  i faithfully assure you that in the mean time there is no one living or dead of whom i shall think oftener or better than of you i shall look upon you as in a state between both in which you will have from me all the passions and warm wishes that can attend the living and all the respect and tender sense of loss that we feel for the dead and i shall ever depend upon your constant friendship kind memory and good offices though i were never to see or hear the effects of them like the trust we have in benevolent spirits who though we never see or hear them we think are constantly serving us and praying for us  whenever i am wishing to write to you i shall conclude you are intentionally doing so to me and every time that i think of you i believe you are thinking of me i never shall suffer to be forgotten nay to be but faintly remembered the honor the pleasure the pride i must ever have in reflecting how frequently you have delighted me how kindly you have distinguished me how cordially you have advised me in conversation in study i shall always want you and wish for you in my most lively and in my most thoughtful hours i shall equally bear about me the impressions of you and perhaps it will not be in this life only that i shall have cause to remember and acknowledge the friendship of the bishop of rochester  i am etc  to the same may        once more i write to you as i promised and this once i fear will be the last the curtain will soon be drawn between my friend and me and nothing left but to wish you a long good night may you enjoy a state of repose in this life not unlike that sleep of the soul which some have believed is to succeed it where we lie utterly forgetful of that world from which we are gone and ripening for that to which we are to go if you retain any memory of the past let it only image to you what has pleased you best sometimes present a dream of an absent friend or bring you back an agreeable conversation but upon the whole i hope you will think less of the time past than of the future as the former has been less kind to you than the latter infallibly will be do not envy the world your studies they will tend to the benefit of men against whom you can have no complaint i mean of all posterity and perhaps at your time of life nothing else is worth your care what is every year of a wise mans life but a censure or critique on the past those whose date is the shortest live long enough to laugh at one half of it the boy despises the infant the man the boy the philosoper both and the christian all you may now begin to think your manhood was too much a puerility and you will never suffer your age to be but a second infancy the toys and baubles of your childhood are hardly now more below you than those toys of our riper and of our declining years the drums and rattles of ambition and the dirt and bubbles of avarice at this time when you are cut off from a little society and made a citizen of the world at large you should bend your talents not to serve a party or a few but all mankind your genius should mount above that mist in which it is participation and neighborhood with earth long involved it to shine abroad and to heaven ought to be the business and the glory of your present situation remember it was at such a time that the greatest lights of antiquity dazzled and blazed the most in their retreat in their exile or in their death but why do i talk of dazzling or blazing it was then that they did good that they gave light and that they became guides to mankind  those aims alone are worthy of spirits truly great and such i therefore hope will be yours resentment indeed may remain perhaps cannot be quite extinguished in the noblest minds but revenge will never harbor there higher principles than those of the first and better principles than those of the latter will infallibly influence men whose thoughts and whose minds are enlarged and cause them to prefer the whole to any part of mankind especially to so small a part as ones single self  believe me my lord i look upon you as a spirit entered into another life as one just upon the edge of immortality where the passions and affections are much more exalted and where you ought to despise all little views and all mean retrospects nothing is worth your looking back therefore fore look forward and make as you can the world look after you but take care that it be not with pity but with esteem and admiration  i am with the greatest sincerity and passion for your fame as well as happiness  your etc the bishop of rochester went into exile the month following and continued in it till his death which happened at paris on the fifteenth day of february in the year         the duke of buckingham to mr pope you desire my opinion as to the late dispute in france concerning homer and i think it excusable at an age alas of not much pleasure to amuse my self a little in taking notice of a controversy than which nothing is at present more remarkable even in a nation who value themselves so much upon the belles lettres both on account of the illustrious subject of it and of the two persons engaged in the quarrel  the one is extraordinary in all the lyric kind of poetry even in the opinion of his very adversary the other a lady and of more value for being so not only of great learning but with a genius admirably turned to that sort of it which most becomes her sex for softness genteelness and promoting of virtue and such as one would think is not so liable as other parts of scholarship to rough disputes or violent animosity  yet it has so happened that no writers even about divinity it self have been more outrageous or uncharitable than these two polite authors by suffering their judgments to be a little warped if i may use that expression by the heat of their eager inclinations to attack or defend so great an author under debate i wish for the sake of the public which is now so well entertained by their quarrel it may not end at last in their agreeing to blame a third man who is so presumptuous as to censure both if they should chance to hear of it  to begin with matter of fact madam dacier has well judged that the best of all poets certainly deserved a better translation at least into french prose because to see it done in verse was despaired of i believe indeed from a defect in that language incapable of mounting to any degree of excellence suitable to so very great an undertaking  she has not only performed this task as well as prose can do it which is indeed but as the wrong side of tapestry is able to represent present the right but she has added to it also many learned and useful annotations with all which she most obligingly delighted not only her own sex but most of ours ignorant of the greek and consequently her adversary himself who frankly acknowledges that ignorance  it is no wonder therefore if in doing this she is grown so enamored of that unspeakablycharming author as to have a kind of horror at the least mention of a man bold enough to blame him  now as to m de la motte he being already deservedly famous for all sorts of lyric poetry was so far introduced by her into those beauties of the epic kind though but in that way of translation as not to resist the pleasure and hope of reputation by attempting that in verse which had been applauded so much for the difficulty of doing it even in prose knowing how this well executed must extremely transcend the other  but as great poets are a little apt to think they have an ancient right of being excused for vanity on all occasions he was not content to outdo madam dacier but endeavored to outdo homer himself and all that ever in any age or nation went before him in the same enterprise by leaving out altering or adding whatever he thought best  against this presumptuous attempt homer has been in all times so well defended as not to need my small assistance yet i must needs say his excellencies are such that for their sake he deserves a much gentler touch for his seeming errors these if m de la motte had translated as well as the rest with an apology for having retained em only out of mere veneration his judgment in my opinion would have appeared much greater than by the best of his alterations though i admit them to be written very finely i join with m de la motte in wondering at some odd things in homer but it is chiefly because of his sublime ones i was about to say his divine ones which almost surprise me at finding him any where in the fallible condition of humane nature  and now we are wondering i am in a difficulty to guess what can be the reason of these exceptions against homer from one who has himself translated him contrary to the general custom of translators is there not a little of that in it i mean to be singular in getting above the title of a translator though sufficiently honorable in this case for such an ambition no body has less occasion than one who is so fine a poet in other kinds and who must have too much wit to believe any alteration of another can entitle him to the denomination of an epic poet himself though no man in this age seems more capable of being a good one if the french tongue would bear it yet in his translation he has done too well to leave any doubt with all his faults that here is can be ever paralleled with it  besides he could not be ignorant that finding faults is the most easy and vulgar part of a critic whereas nothing shows so much skill and taste both as the being thoroughly sensible of the sublimest excellencies  what can we say in excuse of all this humanum est errare since as good a poet as i believe the french language is capable of and as sharp a critic as any nation can produce has by too much censuring homer subjected a translation to censure that would have otherwise stood the test of the severest adversary  but since he would needs choose that wrong way of criticism i wonder he missed a stone so easy to be thrown against homer for his filling the iliad with so muchslaughter for that is to be excused since a war is not capable of being described without it but with so many various particulars of wounds and horror as show the writer i am afraid so delighted that way himself as not the least to doubt his reader being so also like spainoletta whose dismal pictures are the more disagreeable for being always so very movingly painted even hectors last parting from his son and andromache hardly makes us amends for his bodys being dragged thrice round the town m de la motte in his strongest objection about that dismal combat has sufficient cause to blame his enraged adversary who here gives an instance that it is impossible to be violent without committing some mistake her passion for homer blinding her too much to perceive the very grossest of his failings by which warning i am become a little more capable of impartiality though in a dispute about that very poet for whom i have the greatest veneration  madam dacier might have considered a little that whatever were the motives of m de la motte to so bold a proceeding it could not darken that fame which i am sure she thinks shines securely even after the vain attempts of plato himself against it caused only perhaps by a like reason with that of madam daciers anger against m de la motte namely the finding that in prose his genius great as it was could not be capable of the sublime heights of poetry which therefore he banished out of his commonwealth  nor were these objections to homer any more lessening of her merit in translating him as well as that way is capable of viz fully plainly and elegantly than the most admirable verses can be any disparagement to an excellent prose  the best excuse for all this violence is it is being in a cause which gives a kind of reputation even to suffering by never so ill a management of it  the worst of defending even homer in such a passionate manner is it is being more a proof of her weakness than of his being liable to none for what is it can excuse homer any more than hector for flying at the first sight of achilles whose terrible aspect sure needed not such an inexcusable fright to set it off and methinks all that account of minervas restoring his dart to achilles comes a little too late for excusing hectors so terrible apprehension at the very first  to the duke of buckingham sept        i am much honored by your graces compliance with my request in giving me your opinion of the french dispute concerning homer and i shall keep my word in fairly telling wherein i disagree from you it is but in two or three very small points not so much of the dispute as of the parties concerned in it i cannot think quite so highly of the ladys learning though i respect it very much it is great complaisance in that polite nation to allow her to be a critic of equal rank with her husband to instance no further his remarks on horace show more good sense penetration and a better taste of his author and those upon aristotles art of poetry more skill and science than any of hers on any author whatever in truth they are much more slight dwell more in generals and are besides for the most part less her own of which her remarks upon homer are an example where eustathius is transcribed ten times for once that he is quoted nor is there at all more depth or learning in those upon terence plautus or where they were most wanted upon aristophanes only the greek scholia upon the latter are some of the best extant  your grace will believe me that i did not search to find defects in a lady my employment upon the iliad forced me to see them yet i had so much french complaisance as to conceal her thefts for wherever i have found her notes to be wholly another which is the case in some hundreds i have barely quoted the true proprietor without observing upon it if madam dacier has ever seen my observations she will be sensible of this conduct but what effect it may have upon a lady i will not answer for  in the next place as to mr de la motte i think your grace hardly does him right in supposing he could have no idea of the beauties of homers epic poetry but what he learned from madam daciers prosetranslation there had been a very elegant prosetanslation before by monsieur de la valtaire lo elegant that the style of it was evidently the original and model of the famous telemaque your grace very justly animadverts against the too great disposition of finding faults in the one and of confessing none in the other but doubtless as to violence the lady has infinitely the better of the gentleman nothing can be more polite dispassionate or sensible than mr de la mottes manner of managing the dispute and so much as i see your grace admires the beauty of his verse in which you have the suffrage too of the archbishop of cambray i will venture to say his prose is full as good i think therefore when you say no disputants even in divinity could be more outrageous and uncharitable than these two authors you are a little too hard upon m de la motte not but that with your grace i doubt as little of the zeal of commentators as of the zeal of divines and am as ready to believe of the passions and pride of mankind in general that did but the same interests go along with them they would carry the learned world to as violent extremes animosities and even persecutions about variety of opinions in criticism as ever they did about religion and that in defect of scripture to quarrel upon we should have french italian and dutch commentators ready to burn one another about homer virgil terence and horace  i do not wonder your grace is shocked at the flight of hector upon the first appearance of achilles in the twentysecond iliad however to show my self a true commentator if not a true critic i will endeavor to excuse if not to defend it in my notes on that book and to save my self what trouble i can instead of doing it in this letter i will draw up the substance of what i have to say for it in a separate paper which i will show your grace when next we meet i will only desire you to allow me that hector was in an absolute certainty of death and depressed over and above with the conscience of being in an ill cause if your heart be so great as not to grant the first of these will sink the spirit of a hero you will at least be so good as to allow the second may but i can tell your grace no less a hero than my lord peterborow when a person complimented him for never being afraid made this answer sir show me a danger that i think an imminent and real one and i promise you i will be as much afraid as any of you  i am your graces etc  madam daciers reflections on mr popes account of homer in his preface to the iliad upon the finishing of the second edition of my translation of homer a particular friend sent me a translation of part of mr popes preface to his version of the iliad as i do not understand english i cannot form any judgment of his performance though i have heard much of it i am indeed willing to believe that the praises it has met with are not unmerited because whatever work is approved by the english nation cannot be bad but yet i hope i may be permitted to judge of that part of the preface which has been transmitted to me and i here take the liberty of giving my sentiments thereon i must freely acknowledge that mr popes invention is very lively though he seems to have been guilty of the same fault into which he owns we are often precipitated by our invention when we depend too much upon the strength of it as magnanimity says he may run up to profusion and extravagance so may a great invention to redundancy or wildness  this has been the very case of mr pope himself nothing is more overstrained or more false than the images in which his fancy has represented homer sometimes he tells us that the iliad is a  wild paradise where if we cannot see all the beauties as in an ordered garden it is only because the number of them is infinitely greater sometimes he compares him to  a copious nursery which contains the seeds and first productions of every kind and lastly he represents him under the notion of a  mighty tree which rises from the most vigorous seed is improved with industry flourishes and produces the finest fruit but bears too many branches which might be lopped into form to give it a more regular appearance  what is homers poem then according to mr pope a confused heap of beauties without order or symmetry a plat whereon nothing but seeds nor nothing perfect or formed is to be found and a production loaded with many unprofitable things which ought to be retrenched and which choke or disfigure those which ought to be preserved  the most inveterate enemies to homer never said any thing more injurious or more unjust against that poet  as i have defended him with pretty good success against the cavils of so many ignorant censors who have condemned him because they did not understand him i find my self again obliged to defend him against the reproaches of one of greater penetration and may therefore do him more injury in the minds of unlearned readers though at the same time he pretends to have a great veneration for him  mr pope will pardon me then if i here oppose these three comparisons which to me appear very false and entirely contrary to what the greatest ancient and modern critics ever thought  to the point then the iliad is so far from being a wild paradise that it is the most regular garden and laid out with more symmetry than any ever was monsieur le nostre gardener to lewis xiv he laid out the gardens of versailles marli etc  who was the first man of the world in his art never observed in his gardens a more perfect or more admirable symmetry than homer has observed in his poems every thing therein is not only in the place it ought to have but every thing is made for the place it has he presents you at first with that which ought to be first seen he places in the middle what ought to be in the middle and what would improperly be at the beginning or end and he removes what ought to be at a greater distance to create the more agreeable surprise and to use a comparison drawn from painting he places that in the greatest light which cannot be too visible and sinks in the obscurity of the shade what does not require a full view so that it may be said that homer is the painter who best knew how to employ the shades and lights and it was this wonderfully beauteous order which horace admired in his poems and on which he founded his rules for the perfecting of the art of poetry  the second comparison is as unjust how could mr pope say that one can only discover  seeds and the first productions of every kind in the iliad every beauty is therein to so great a perfection that the following ages could add nothing to those of any kind and the ancients have always proposed homer as the most perfect model in all kinds of poetry  the third comparison is composed of the errors of the two former homer had certainly an incomparable fertility of invention but his fertility is always checked by that just sense which made him reject every superfluous thing which his vast imagination could offer him to retain only what was useful or necessary judgment guided the hand of this admirable gardener and was the pruninghook he employed to lop off every useless branch he has done what horace directs inutilesque falce ramos amputans feliciores inserit   mr pope had done us a great piece of service if he had pointed out the useless branches that ought to be lopped from this tree the symmetry which ought to be given to that wild garden to render it more regular and the perfection which is wanting to the several beauties he says homer has only sketched out it would be very happy for the present age and glorious to england to have produced so perfect a critic  now i have defended homer i must also defend myself against a criticism he has made upon a part of my preface where speaking of the manners of homers heroes so like those of the patriarchs i have said i find these ancient times so much the finer as they the less resemble our own upon this mr pope exclaims who can be so prejudiced in their favor as to magnify their felicity when a spirit of revenge and cruelty reigned through the world when no mercy was shown but for the sake of lucre when the greatest princes were put to the sword and their wives and daughters made slaves and concubines mr pope sure mistook me  when i said so could i mean that the manners of these heroical times were perfect and without fault were they so in more happy times were there no tokens then of cruelty or revenge were there no captives made were there no kings put to the sword were there no concubines seen among them and since the christian religion has taught a more perfect morality was there never a spirit of revenge and cruelty seen amongst christians do they not make no more prisoners of war and do not they redeem them was there never a concubine or something worse seen among them did all these vices which mr pope blames those ancient times for hinder nature from being then very plain far from the luxury pomp and effeminacy which have corrupted the following ages are not these manners of homers heroes very like those of the patriarchs and very unlike these of our own time i might then say that those times and manners seemed so much the more excellent to me as they less resemble those of our own durst mr pope himself prefer the manners of the present age to those of the ancient times no without doubt for six lines after he embraces my opinion which he had blamed i find says he a pleasure in observing the simplicity of that age in opposition to the pomp and luxury of the following ages one may then according to his own sense prefer those ages of natural simplicity to these that are corrupted with pomp and luxury  i own i did not expect to find my self attacked by mr pope in a preface wherein i might have expected some small token of acknowledgment or at least some slight approbation for having been so happy as to think on several things in the way he himself does especially in the manners of the ancients after i had said in my preface  that princes tended their flocks that princesses drew water at the spring and brought examples to prove this from the holy scriptures and the roman history itself i conclude with these words i love to see juno dressing herself without the trinkets of a toilet or the assistance of a waiting woman it is the same with the heroes as with the gods one sees neither footmen nor valets de chamber nor guards about achilles agamemnon etc hercules and theseus had none of these mr pope says the same thing there is a pleasure in beholding monarchs without their guards princes tending their flocks and princesses drawing water from the springs  i am overjoyed to find that mr pope is as much in love with the simplicity of the ancient times as i am it is a token that he abhors the pomp and luxury of our own and gives me reason to hope that a little reflection will induce him to approve what i have said and he has so unjustly condemned  i could remark upon several other things in his preface this preface of madam dacier was written long before mr pope wrote his and i think the lady is very modest when he uses her own words to say that she was happy in having thought as he did though it is plain that he borrowed this thought from her and the approbation of mr fraguier who certainly was a good judge gives her an encomium that shows she is both an excellent translatress and critic as all the world indeed owns her to be except the illiterati who presume to run her down that the public may not perceive how they enrich themselves with her spoils i shall here insert the approbation abovementioned verbatim  i have by order of my lord chancellor read the iliad of homer translated into french with remarks by madam dacier and i think that this translation wherein the beauties of the original are so perfectly found will be both an honor to our nation and the present age given at paris this  st day of december    0 signed fraguier    but i have not the leisure at present that this would require however i cannot conclude without correcting two considerable errors mr pope is fallen into the first when speaking of the fable he says homer created a moving world for himself in the invention of the fable or words to that effect what does he mean by this when plato tells us that when god created time he created a moving image of eternity i understand that language it presents an idea to my mind which i conceive and find to be just and fine but to create a moving world in the intention of the fable is a confused idea which i can neither unravel nor understand besides there is not the least shadow of truth to affirm that homer invented the fable it is much antienter was invented long before his time and he found the use of it wholly established as i have shown in my preface to the odyssey for homers fable is not at all different from the fables of aesop as those are not all different from such as were in use a long time before him all that homer has done is that he has built his epic fable on that first fable and extending it by his episodes gave it a grandeur proportionable to his own views and designs it is for this reason that aristotle calls the fable the composition of things and says very justly that it is the soul of the poem  the second error which is not less material is when speaking of poetical manners mr pope says as there is more variety of characters in the iliad so there is of speeches than in any other poem every thing in it has manners as aristotle expresses it that is every thing is acted or spoken nothing can be more repugnant to the doctrine of that philosopher he never said that any one thing has manners that is that it is either acted or spoken he says on the contrary that there are discourses without manners and that in his time there were many tragedies without manners and yet there were both action and discourse in these dramas this is a sure sign that manners are neither actions nor discourses since discourses and actions may be without manners what are manners then according to aristotle manners says he are what discover the inelination of the person who speaks and the side he will take upon any accident wherein it would not be easy to find him out therefore all discourses that do not let you at first discover what he that speaks will resolve himself to do are without manners it is astonishing that mr pope has not understood a thing which is so clearly explained in aristotles art of poetry and in my preface to the odyssey i refer that learned man to these two works wherein he may satisfy himself concerning this point  the faults i blame him for are so trivial that they ought not to hinder the english nation from expecting from this new poet the great advantages which are to be hoped for from a reformer of homer so bright a man will not confine himself to perfect only the art of epic poesy that would be a trifling matter no he will perfect the art of politics much more valuable and more important than that of epic poesy a man capable to correct homer will be able to form the manners of men alcibiades was of this opinion for a grammarian having made his brags before him that he had in his closet an homer corrected with his own hand what friend said he art thou capable to correct homer and do thou waste thy time in teaching children why do thou not apply thy self to form the manners of men  of what infinite consequence then will mr pope be to a state since he can reform homer  anne le fevre dacier  letters of mr blount to mr pope it is with a great deal of pleasure i see your letter dear sir written in a style that shows you full of health and in the midst of diversions i think those two things necessary to a man who has such undertakings in hand as yours all lovers of homer are indebted to you for taking so much pains about the situation of his heros kingdoms it will not only be of great use with regard to his works but to all that read any of the greek historians who generally are ill understood through the difference of the maps as to the places they treat of which makes one think one author contradicts another you are going to set us right and it is an advantage every body will gladly see you engross the glory of  you can draw rules to be free and easy from formal pedants and teach men to be short and pertinent from tedious commentators however i congratulate your happy deliverance from such authors as you with all your humanity cannot wish alive again to converse with critics will quarrel with you if you dare to please without their leave and zealots will shrug up their shoulders at a man that pretends to get to heaven out of their form dress and diet i would no more make a judgment of an authors genius from a damning critic than i would of a mans religion from an unsaving zealot  i could take great delight in affording you the new glory of making a barceloniad if i may venture to coin such a word i fancy you would find a juster parallel than it seems at first sight for the trojans too had a great mixture of folly with their bravery and i am out of countenance for them when i read the wife result of their council where after a warm debate between antenor and paris about restoring helen priam sagely determines that they shall go to supper and as for the greeks what can equal their superstition in sacrificing an innocent lady tantum religio potuit etc   i have a good opinion of my politics since they agree with a man who always thinks so justly as you i wish it were in our power to persuade all the nation into as calm and steady a disposition of mind  we have received the late melancholy news with the usual ceremony of condoling in one breath for the loss of a gracious queen and in another rejoicing for an illustrious king my views carry me no farther than to wish the peace and welfare of my country and my morals and politics teach me to leave all that to be adjusted by our representatives above and to divine providence it is much at one to you and me who sit at the helm provided they will permit us to sail quietly in the great ship ambition is a vice that is timely mortified in us poor papists we ought in recompense to cultivate as many virtues in our selves as we can that we may be truly great among my ambitions that of being a sincere friend is one of the chief yet i will confess that i have a secret pleasure to have some of my descendants know that their ancestor was great with mr pope  i am etc  from the same nov         it is an agreement of long date between you and me that you should do with my letters just as you pleased and answer them at your leisure and that is as soon as i shall think you ought i have so true a taste of the substantial part of your friendship that i wave all ceremonials and am sure to make you as many visits as i can and leave you to return them whenever you please assuring you they shall at all times be heartily welcome to me  the many alarms we have from your parts have no effect upon the genius that reigns in our country which is happily turned to preserve peace and quiet among us what a dismal scene has there been opened in the north what ruin have those unfortunate rash gentlemen drawn upon themselves and their miserable followers and perchance upon many others too who upon no account would be their followers however it may look ungenerous to reproach people in distress i dont remember you and i ever used to trouble our selves about politics but when any matter happened to fall into our discourse we used to condemn all undertakings that tended toward the disturbing the peace and quiet of our country as contrary to the notions we had of morality and religion which oblige us on no pretense whatsoever to violate the laws of charity how many lives have there been lost in hot blood and how many more are there like to be taken off in cold if the broils of the nation affect you come down to me and though we are farmers you know eumeus made his friends welcome you shall here worship the echo at your ease indeed we are forced to do so because we cannot hear the first report and therefore are obliged to listen to the second which for security sake i do not always believe neither  it is a great many years since i fell in love with the character of pomponius atticus i longed to imitate him a little and have contrived hitherto to be like him engaged in no party but to be a faithful friend to some in both i find my self very well in this way hitherto and live in a certain peace of mind by it which i am persuaded brings a man more content than all the perquisites of wild ambition i with pleasure join with you in wishing nay i am not ashamed to say in praying for the welfare temporal and eternal of all mankind how much more affectionately then shall i do so for you since i am in a most particular manner and with all sincerity  your etc  mr blount died at london       letters of mr digby to mr pope coleshill apr         i have read your letter over and over with delight by your description of the town i imagine it to lie under some great enchantment and am very much concerned for you and all my friends in it i am the more afraid imagining since you do not fly those horrible monsters rapine dissimulation and luxury that a magic circle is drawn about you and you cannot escape we are here in the country in quite another world surrounded with blessings and pleasures without any occasion of exercising our irascible faculties indeed we cannot boast of goodbreeding and the art of life but yet we dont live unpleasantly in primitive simplicity and good humor the fashions of the town affect us but just like a rareeshow we have a curiosity to peep at em and nothing more what you call pride prodigality and vainglory we cannot find in pomp and splendor at this distance it appears to us a fine glittering scene which if we dont envy you we think you happier than we are in enjoying it whatever you may think to persuade us of the humility of virtue and her appearing in rags amongst you we can never believe our uninformd minds represent her so noble to us that we necessarily annex splendor to her and we could as soon imagine the order of things inverted and that there is no man in the moon as believe the contrary i cannot forbear telling you we indeed read the spoils of rapine as boys do the english rogue and hug our selves full as much over it yet our roses are not without thorns pray give me the pleasure of hearing when you are at leisure how soon i may expect to see the next volume of homer  i am etc  mr digby to mr pope may       0 your letter which i had two posts ago was very medicinal to me and i heartily thank you for the relief it gave me i was sick of the thoughts of my not having in all this time given you any testimony of the affection i owe you and which i as constantly indeed feel as i think of you this indeed was a troublesome ill to me till after reading your letter i found it was a most idle weak imagination to think i could so offend you of all the impressions you have made upon me i never received any with greater joy than this of your abundant goodnature which bids me be assured of some share of your affections  i had many other pleasures from your letter that your mother remembers me is a very sincere joy to me i cannot but reflect how alike you are from the time you do any one a favor you think yourselves obliged as those that have received one this is indeed an oldfashioned respect hardly to be found out of your house i have great hopes however to see many oldfashioned virtues revive since you have made our age in love with homer i heartily wish you who are as good a citizen as a poet the joy of seeing a reformation from your works i am in doubt whether i should congratulate your having finished homer while the two essays you mention are not completed but if you expect no great trouble from finishing these i heartily rejoice with you  i have some faint notion of the beauties of twickenham from what i here see round me the verdure of showers is poured upon every tree and field about us the gardens unfold variety of colors to the eye every morning the hedges breath is beyond all perfume and the song of birds we hear as well as you but though i hear and see all this yet i think they would delight me more if you was here i found the want of these at twickenham while i was there with you by which i guess what an increase of charms it must now have how kind is it in you to wish me there and how unfortunate are my circumstances that allow me not to visit you if i see you i must leave my father alone and this uneasy thought would disappoint all my proposed pleasures the same circumstance will prevent my project of many happy hours with you in lord bathursts wood and i fear of seeing you till winter unless lady scudamore comes to sherburne in which case i shall press you to see dorsetshire as you proposed may you have a long enjoyment of your new favorite portico  your etc  mr digby to mr pope sherburne july      0 the london language and conversation is i find quite changed since i left it though it is not above three or four months ago no violent change in the natural world ever astonished a philosopher so much as this does me i hope this will calm all partyrage and introduce more humanity than has of late obtained in conversation all scandal will sure be laid aside for there can be no such disease any more as spleen in this new golden age i am pleased with the thoughts of seeing nothing but a general good humor when i come up to town i rejoice in the universal riches i hear of in the thought of their having this effect they tell me you was soon content and that you eared not for such an increase as others wished you by this account i judge you the richest man in the south sea and congratulate you accordingly i can wish you only an increase of health for of riches and fame you have enough  your etc  mr digby to mr pope sherburne july  0 i congratulate you dear sir on the return of the golden age for sure this must be such in which money is showerd down in such abundance upon us i hope this overflowing will produce great and good fruits and bring back the figurative moral goldenage to us i have some omens to induce me to believe it may for when the muses delight to be near a court when i find you frequently with a firstminister i cannot but expect from such an intimacy an encouragement and revival of the polite arts i know you desire to bring them into honor above the golden image which is set up and worshipped and if you cannot effect it adieu to all such hopes you seem to intimate in yours another face of things from this inundation of wealth as if beauty wit and valor would no more engage our passions in the pleasurable pursuit of them though assisted by this increase if so and if monsters only as various as those of nile arise from this abundance who that has any spleen about him will not haste to town to laugh what will become of the playhouse who will go thither while there is such entertainment in the streets i hope we shall neither want good satire nor comedy if we do the age may well be thought barren of geniuss for none has ever produced better subjects  your etc  mr digby to mr pope coleshill nov       0 i find in my heart that i have a taint of the corrupt age we live in i want the public spirit so much admired in old rome of sacrificing every thing that is dear to us to the commonwealth i even feel a more intimate concern for my friends who have suffered in the south sea than for the public which is said to be undone by it but i hope the reason is that i do not see so evidently the ruin of the public to be a consequence of it as i do the loss of my friends i fear there are few besides yourself that will be persuaded by old hesiod that half is more than the whole i know not whether i do not rejoice in your sufferings since they have shown me your mind is principled with such a sentiment i assure you i expect from it a performance greater still than homer i have an extreme joy from your communicating to me this affection of your mind quid voveat dulci nutricula majus alumno believe me dear sir no equipage could show you to my eye in so much splendour i would not indulge this fit of philosophy so far as to be tedious to you else i could prosecute it with pleasure  i long to see you your mother and your villa till then i will say nothing of lord bathursts wood which i saw in my return hither soon after christmas i design for london where i shall miss lady scudamore very much who intends to stay in the country all winter i am angry with her as i am like to suffer by this resolution and would fain blame her but cannot find a cause the man is cursed that has a longer letter than this to write with as bad a pen yet i can use it with pleasure to send my services to your good mother and to write myself your etc  mr digby to mr pope sherburne aug         i cannot return from so agreeable an entertainment as yours in the country without acknowledging it i thank you heartily for the new idea of life you there gave me it will remain long with me for it is very strongly impressed upon my imagination i repeat the memory of it often and shall value that faculty of the mind now more than ever for the power it gives me of being entertained in your villa when absent from it as you are possessed of all the pleasures of the country and as i think of a right mind what can i wish you but health to enjoy them this i so heartily do that i should be even glad to hear your good old mother might lose all her present pleasures in her unwearied care of you by your better health convincing her it is unnecessary  i am troubled and shall be so till i hear you have received this letter for you gave me the greatest pleasure imaginable in yours and i am impatient to acknowledge it if i any ways deserve that friendly warmth and affection with which you write it is that i have a heart full of love and esteem for you so truly that i should lose the greatest pleasure of my life if i lost your good opinion it rejoices me very much to be reckoned by you in the class of honest men for though i am not troubled overmuch about the opinion most may have of me yet i own it would grieve me not to be thought well of by you and some few others i will not doubt my own strength yet i have this further security to maintain my integrity that i cannot part with that without forfeiting your esteem with it  perpetual disorder and ill health has for some years so disguised me that i sometimes fear i do not to my best friends enough appear what i really am sickness is a great oppressor it does great injury to a zealous heart stifling it is warmth and not suffering it to break out in action but i hope i shall not make this complaint much longer i have other hopes that please me too though not so well grounded these are that you may yet make a journey westward with lord bathurst but of the probability of this i do not venture to reason because i would not part with the pleasure of that belief it grieves me to think how far i am removed from you and from that excellent lord whom i love indeed i remember him as one that has made sickness easy to me by bearing with my infirmities in the same manner that you have always done i often too consider him in other lights that make him valuable to me with him i know not by what connection you never fail to come into my mind as if you were inseparable i have as you guess many philosophical reveries in the shades of sir walter raleigh of which you are a great part you generally enter there with me and like a good genius applaud and strengthen all my sentiments that have honor in them this good office which you have often done me unknowingly i must acknowledge now that my own breast may not reproach me with ingratitude and disquiet me when i would muse again in that solemn scene i have not room left to ask you many questions i intended about the odyssey i beg i may know how far you have carried ulysses on his journey and how you have been entertained with him on the way i desire i may hear of your health of mrs popes and of every thing else that belongs to you  how thrive your garden plants how look the trees how spring the broculi and the fenochio hard names to spell how did the poppies bloom and how is the great room approved what parties have you had of pleasure what in the grotto what upon the thames i would know how all your hours pass all you say and all you do of which i should question you yet farther but my paper is full and spares you my brother ned is wholly yours so my father desires to be and every soul here whose name is digby my sister will be yours in particular what can i add more  i am etc  to the hon edward digby april         i have a great inclination to write to you though i cannot by writing any more than i could by words express what part i bear in your suffering nature and esteem in you are joined to aggravate your affliction the latter i have in a degree equal even to yours and a tie of friendship approaches near to the tenderness of nature yet god knows no man living is less fit to comfort you as no man is more deeply sensible than my self of the greatness of the loss that very virtue which secures his present state from all the sorrows incident to ours does but aggrandise our sensation of it is being removed from our sight from our affection and from our imitation the friendship and society of good men does but complete their felicity before our own who probably are not yet arrived to their degree of perfection which merits an immediate reward that your dear brother and my dear friend was so i take his very removal to be a proof providence would certainly lend virtuous men to a world that so much wants them as long as in it is justice to them it could spare them to us may my soul be with those who have meant well and have acted well to that meaning and i doubt not if this prayer be granted i shall be with him let us preserve his memory in the way he would best like by recollecting what his behavior would have been in every incident of our lives to come and doing in each just as we think he would have done so we shall have him always before our eyes and in our minds and more in our lives and manners i hope when we shall meet him next we shall be more of a piece with him and consequently not to be ever more separated from him i will add but one word that relates to what remains of your self and me since so valued a part of us is gone it is to beg you to accept as yours by inheritance of the vacancy he has left in a heart which while he could fill it with such hopes wishes and affections for him as suited a mortal creature was truly and warmly ly his and shall i assure you in the sincerity of sorrow for my own loss be faithfully at your service while i continue to love his memory that is while i continue to be  ap  the honorable robert digby died in the year      and is buried in the church of sherburne in dorsetshire with the following epitaph written by the author go fair example of untainted youth of modest wisdom and pacific truth composed in sufferings and in joy sedate good without noise without pretension great just of thy word in every wish sincere who knew no wish but what the world might hear of softest manners unaffected mind lover of peace and friend of human kind go live for heavens eternal year is thine go and exalt thy moral to divine   letters to hugh bethel esquire etc from      to      july         i assure you unfeignedly any memorial of your goodnature and friendliness is most welcome to me who know those tenders of affection from you are not like the common traffic of compliments and professions which most people only give that they may receive and is at best a commerce of vanity if not of falsehood i am happy in not immediately wanting the sort of good offices you offer but if i did want em i should not think my self unhappy in receiving em at your hands this really is some compliment for i would rather most men did me a small injury than a kindness i know your humanity and allow me to say i love and value you for it it is a much better ground of love and value than all the qualities i see the world so fond of they generally admire in the wrong place and generally most admire the things they dont comprehend or the things they can never be the better for very few can receive pleasure or advantage from wit which they seldom taste or learning which they seldom understand much less from the quality high birth or shining circumstances of those to whom they profess esteem and who will always remember how much they are their inferiors but humanity and sociable virtues are what every creature wants every day and still wants more the longer he lives and most the very moment he dies it is ill traveling either in a ditch or on a terras we should walk in the common way where others are continually passing on the same level to make the journey of life supportable by bearing one another company in the same circumstances  let me know how i may convey over the odysses for your amusement in your journey that you many compare your own travels with those of ulysses i am sure yours are undertaken upon a more disinterested and therefore a more heroic motive far be the omen from you of returning as he did alone without saving a friend  there is lately printed a book mr wollastons religion of nature delineated wherein all human virtue is reduced to one test that of truth and branched out in every instance of our duty to god and man if you have not seen it you must and i will send it together with the odyssey the very women read it and pretend to be charmed with that beauty which they generally think the least of they make as much ado about truth since this book appeared as they did about health when dr cheynes came out and will doubtless be as constant in the pursuit of one as of the other adieu  aug        i never am unmindful of those i think so well of as yourself their number is not so great as to confound ones memory nor ought you to decline writing to me upon an imagination that i am much employed by other people for though my house is like the house of a patriarch of old standing by the highway side and receiving all travelers nevertheless i seldom go to bed without the reflection that ones chief business is to be really at home and i agree with you in your opinion of company amusements and all the silly things which mankind would fain make pleasures of when in truth they are labor and sorrow  i condole with you on the death of your relation the e of c the earl of cadogan who died july         as on the fate of a mortal man esteem i never had for him but concern and humanity i had the latter was due to the infirmity of his last period though the former was not due to the triumphant and vain part of his course he certainly knew himself best at last and knew best the little value of others whose neglect of him whom they so grossly followed and flattered in the former scene of his life showed them as worthless as they could imagine him to be were he all that his worst enemies believed of him for my own part i am sorry for his death and wish he had lived long enough to see so much of the faithlesness of the world as to have been above the mad ambition of governing such wretches as he must have found it to be composed of  though you could have no great value for this great man yet acquaintance itself the custom of seeing the face or entering under the roof of one that walks along with us in the common way of the world is enough to create a wish at least for his being above ground and a degree of uneasiness at his removal it is the loss of an object familiar to us i should hardly care to have an old post pulled up that i remembered ever since i was a child and add to this the reflection in the case of such as were not the best of their species what their condition in another life may be it is yet a more important motive for our concern and compassion to say the truth either in the case of death or life almost every body and every thing is a cause or object for humanity even prosperity itself and health itself so many weak pitiful incidentals attend on them  i am sorry any relation of yours is ill whoever it be for you dont name the person but i conclude it is one of those to whose houses you tell me you are going for i know no invitation with you is so strong as when any one is in distress or in want of your assistance the strongest proof in the world of this was your attendance on the late earl  i have been very melancholy for the loss of mr blount whoever has any portion of good nature will suffer on these occasions but a good mind rewards it is own sufferings i hope to trouble you as little as possible if it be my fate to go before you i am of old enniuss mind nemo me docoret lachrymis  i am but a lodger here this is not an abiding city i am only to stay out my lease for what has perpetuity and mortal man to do with each other but i could be glad you would take up with an inn at twitenham as long as i am host of it if not i would take up freely with any inn of yours  adieu dear sir let us while away this life and if we can meet in another  june         you are too humane and considerate things few people can be charged with do not say you will not expect letters from me upon my word i can no more forbear writing sometimes to you than thinking often of you i know the world too well not to value you who are an example of acting living and thinking above it and contrary to it  i thank god for my mothers unexpected recovery though my hope can rise no higher than from reprieve to reprieve the small addition of a few days to the many she has already seen yet so short and transitory as this light is it is all i have to warm or shine upon me and when it is out there is nothing else that will live for me or consume itself in my service but i would have you think this is not the chief motive of my concern about her gratitude is a cheap virtue one may pay it very punctually for it costs us nothing but our memory of the good done and i owe her more good than ever i can pay or she at this age receive if i could i do not think the tranquillity of the mind ought to be disturbed for many things in this world but those offices that are necessary duties either to our friends or our selves will hardly prove any breach of it and as much as they take away from our indolence and ease of body will contribute to our peace and quiet of mind by the content they give they often afford the highest pleasure and those who do not feel that will hardly ever find another to match it let them love themselves ever so dearly at the same time it must be owned one meets with cruel disappointments in seeing so often the best endeavors ineffectual to make others happy and very often what is most cruel of all through their own means but still i affirm those very disappointments of a virtuous man are greater pleasures than the utmost gratifications and successes of a mere selflover  the great and sudden event king george i died june  0      which has just now happened puts the whole world i mean this whole world into a new state the only use i have shall or wish to make of it is to observe the disparity of men from themselves in a weeks time the desultory leaping and catching of new motions new modes new measures and that strange spirit and life with which men broken and disappointed resume their hopes their solicitations their ambitions it would be worth your while as a philosopher to be busy in these observations and to come hither to see the fury and bustle of the bees this hot season without coming so near as to be stung by them  yours etc  june         after the publishing of my boyish letters to mr cromwell you will not wonder if i should forswear writing a letter again while i live since i do not correspond with a friend upon the terms of any other free subject of this kingdom but to you i can never be silent or reserved and i am sure my opinion of your heart is such that i could open mine to you in no manner which i could fear the whole world should know i could publish my own heart too i will venture to say for any mischief or malice there is in it but a little too much folly or weakness might i fear appear to make such a spectacle either instuctive or agreeable to others  i am reduced to beg of all my acquaintance to secure me from the like usage for the future by returning me any letters of mine which they may have preserved that i may not be hurt after my death by that which was the happiness of my life their partiality and affection to me  i have nothing of my self to tell you only that i have had but indifferent health i have not made a visit to london curiosity and the love of dissipation dye apace in me i am not glad nor sorry for it but i am very sorry for those who have nothing else to live on  i have read much but writ no more i have small hopes of doing good no vanity in writing and little ambition to please a world not very candid or deserving if i can preserve the good opinion of a few friends it is all i can expect considering how little good i can do even them to merit it few people have your candor or are so willing to think well of another from whom they receive no benefit and gratify no vanity but of all the soft sensations the greatest pleasure is to give and receive mutual trust it is by belief and firm hope that men are made happy in this life as well as in the other my confidence dence in your good opinion and dependence upon that of one or two more is the chief cordial drop i taste amidst the insipid the disagreeable the cloying or the deadsweet which are the common draughts of life some pleasures are too pert as well as others too flat to be relished long and vivacity in some cases is worse than dullness therefore indeed for many years i have not chosen my companions for any of the qualities in fashion but almost entirely for that which is the most outoffashion sincerity before i am aware of it i am making your panegyric and perhaps my own too for next to possessing the best of qualities is the esteeming and distinguishing those who possess it i truly love and value you and so i stop short  aug        you might well think me negligent or forgetful of you if true friendship and sincere esteem were to be measured by common forms and compliments the truth is i could not write then without saying something of my own condition and of my loss of so old and so deserving a parent mrs pope died the seventh of june      aged     which really would have troubled you or i must have kept a silence upon that head which would not have suited that freedom and sincere opening of the heart which is due to you from me i am now pretty well but my home is uneasy to me still and i am therefore wandering about all this summer i was but four days at twitenham since the occasion that made it so melancholy i have been a fortnight in essex and am now at dawley whose master is your servant and going to cirencester to lord bathurst i shall also see southampton with lord peterborow the court and twitnam i shall forsake together i wish i did not leave our friend who deserves more quiet and more health and happiness than can be found in such a family the rest of my acquaintance are tolerably happy in their various ways of life whether court country or town and mr cleland is as well in the park as if he were in paradise i heartily hope yorkshire is the same to you and that no evil moral and physical may come near you  i have now but too much melancholy leisure and no other care but to finish my essay on man there will be in it one line shall burning aetna if a sage requires forget to thunder and recall her fires on air or sea new motions be impressed o blameless bethel to relieve thy breast  that may offend you i fear and yet i will not alter or omit it unless you come to town and prevent me before i print it which will be in a fortnight in all probability in plain truth i will not deny my self the greatest pleasure i am capable of receiving because another may have the modesty not to share it it is all a poor poet can do to bear testimony to the virtue he cannot reach besides that in this age i have too few good examples not to lay hold on any i can find you see what an interested man i am  adieu  to mr fenton may        i had not omitted answering years of the   th of last month but out of a desire to give you some certain and satisfactory account which way and at what time you might take your journey i am now commissioned to tell you that mr craggs will expect you on the rising of the parliament which will be as soon as he can receive a man de belles lettres that is in tranquillity and full leisure i dare say your way of life which in my taste will be the best in the world and with one of the best men in the world must prove highly to your contentment and i must add it will be still the more a joy to me as i shall reap a peculiar advantage from the good i shall have done in bringing you together by seeing it in my own neighborhood mr craggs has taken a house close by mine whither he proposes to come in three weeks in the mean time i heartily invite you to live with me where a frugal and philosophical diet for a time may give you a higher relish of that elegant way of life you will enter into after i desire to know by the first post how soon i may hope for you  i am a little scandalized at your complaint that your time lies heavy on your hands when the muses have put so many good materials into your head to employ them as to your question what i am doing i answer just what i have been doing some years my duty secondly relieving my self with necessary amusements or exercises which shall serve me instead of physic as long as they can thirdly reading till i am tired and lastly writing when i have no other thing in the world to do or no friend to entertain in company my mother is i thank god the easier if not the better for my cares and i am the happier in that regard as well as in the consciousness of doing my best my next felicity is in retaining the good opinion of honest men who think me not quite undeserving of it and in finding no injuries from others hurt me as long as i know my self i will add the sincerity with which i act toward ingenious and undesigning men and which makes me always even

circumstance is it for one that loves rambling so well to be a grave and reputable rambler while like your fellow circuiteer the sun you travel the round of the earth and behold all the iniquities

description of buckinghamhouse written by him to the d of shrewsbury pliny was one of those few authors who had a warm house over his head nay two houses as appears by two of his epistles i believe if any of his cotemporary authors durst have informed the public where they lodged we should have found the garrets of rome as well inhabited as those of fleetstreet but it is dangerous to let creditors into such a secret therefore we may presume that then as well as nowadays no body knew where they lived but their booksellers  it seems that when virgil came to rome he had no lodgings at all he first introduced himself to augustus by an epigram beginning noctle pluit tota  an observation which probably he had not made unless he had lain all night in the street  where juvenal lived we cannot affirm but in one of his satires he complains of the excessive price of lodgings neither do i think he would have talked so feelingly of the shortness of codruss bed if there had been room for a bedfellow in it  i believe with all the ostentation of pliny he would have been glad to have changed both his houses for your graces one which is a country house in the summer and a townhouse in the winter and must be owned to be the properest habitation for a wise man who sees all the world change every season without ever changing himself  i have been reading the description of plinys house with an eye to yours but finding they will bear no comparison will try if it can be matched by the large country seat i inhabit at present and see what figure it may make by the help of a florid description  you must expect nothing regular in my description any more than in the house the whole vast edifice is so disjointed and the several parts of it so detached one from the other and yet so joining again one cannot tell how that in one of my poetical fits i imagined it had been a village in amphions time where the cottages having taken a country dance together had been all out and stood stone still with amazement ever since  you must excuse me if i say nothing of the front indeed i dont know which it is a stranger would be grievously disappointed who endeavored to get into this house the right way one would reasonably expect after the entry through the porch to be let into the hall alas nothing less you find your self in the house of office from the parlour you think to step into the

atrue image of ancient hospitality the walls are all over ornamented with monstrous horns of animals about twenty broken pikes ten or a dozen blunderbusses and a rusty matchlock musket or two which we

preserves the memory of a knight whose iron armor is long since perished with rust and whose alabaster nose is moulderd from his monument the face of dame eleanor in another piece owes more to that single pane than to all the glasses she ever consulted in her life after this who can say glass is frail when it is not half so frail as human beauty or glory and yet i cannot but sigh to think that the most authentic record of so ancient a family should lie at the mercy of every boy that flings a stone in former days there have dined in this hall garterd knights and courtly dames attended by ushers sewers and senechals and yet it was but last night that an owl flew hither and mistook it for a barn  this hall lets you up and down over a very high threshold into the great parlour it is contents are a brokenbellyd virginal a couple of cripled velvet chairs with two or three mildewd pictures of moldy ancestors who look as dismally as if they came fresh from hell with all their brimstone about them these are carefully set at the farther corner for the windows being every where broken make it so convenient a place to dry poppies and mustard seed that the room is appropriated to that use  next this parlour as i said before lies the pigeonhouse by the side of which runs an entry which lets you on one hand or other into a bedchamber a buttery and a small hole called the chaplains study then follow a brewhouse a little green and gilt parlour and the great stairs under which is the dairy a little farther on the right the servants hall and by the side of it up six steps the old ladys closet for her private devotions which has a lettice into the hall that at the same time she prayed she might have an eye on the men and maids there are upon the groundfloor in all twenty six apartments among which i must not forget a chamber which has in it a large antiquity of timber that seems to have been either a bedstead or a cyderpress  the kitchen is built in form of a rotunda being one vast vault to the top of the roof where the same aperture serves to let out the smoke and let in the light by the blackness of the walls the circular fires vast cauldrons yawning mouths of ovens and furnaces you would think it either the forge of vulcan the cave of polypheme or the temple of moloch the horror of this place has made such an impression on the country people that they believe the witches keep their sabbath here and that once a year the devil treats them with infernal venison a roasted tiger stuffed with tenpenny nails  above stairs we have a number of rooms you never pass out of one into another but by the ascent or descent of two or three stairs our best room is very long and low of the exact proportion of a bandbox in most of these there are hangings of the finest work in the world that is to say those which arachne spins from her own bowels were it not for this only furniture the whole would be a miserable scene of naked walls flawd cielings broken windows and rusty locks the roof is so decayed that after a favorable shower we may expect a crop of mushrooms between the chinks of our floors all the doors are as little and low as those to the cabbins of packet boats these rooms have for many years had no other inhabitants than certain rats whose very age renders them worthy of this seat for the very rats of this venerable house are gray since these have not yet quitted it we hope at least that this ancient mansion may not fall during the small remnant the poor animals have to live who are now too infirm to remove to another there is yet a small subsistence left them in the few remaining books of the library  we had never seen half what i have described but for a starched greyheaded steward who is as much an antiquity as any in this place and looks like an old family picture walked out of it is frame he entertained us as we passed from room to room with several relations of the family but his observations were particularly curious when we came to the cellar he informed us where stood the triple rows of buts of sack and where were ranged the bottles of tent for toasts in a morning he pointed to the stands that supported the ironhoopd hogsheads of strong beer then stepping to a corner he luggd out the tattered fragments of an unframed picture this says he with tears was poor sir thomas once master of all this drink he had two sons poor young masters who never arrived to the age of his beer they both fell ill in this very room and never went out on their own legs he could not pass by a heap of broken bottles without taking up a piece to show us the arms of the family upon it he then led us up the tower by dark winding stonesteps which landed us into several little rooms one above another one of these was nailed up and our guide whispered to us as a secret the occasion of it it seems the course of this noble blood was a little interrupted about two centuries ago by a freak of the lady frances who was here taken in the fact with a neighboring prior ever since which the room has been nailed up and branded with the name of the adulterychamber the ghost of lady frances is supposed to walk there and some prying maids of the family report that they have seen a lady in a fardingale through the keyhole but this matter is hushed up and the servants are forbid to talk of it  i must needs have tired you by this long description but what engaged me in it was a generous principle to preserve the memory of that which it self must soon fall into dust nay perhaps part of it before this letter reaches your hands  indeed we owe this old house the same kind of gratitude that we do to an old friend who harbors us in his declining condition nay even in his last extremities how fit is this retreat for uninterrupted study where no one that passes by can dream there is an inhabitant and even those who would dine with us dare not stay under our roof any one who sees it will own i could not have chosen a more likely place to converse with the dead i had been to blame indeed if i had left your grace for any one but homer but when i return to the living i shall have the sense to endeavor to converse with some of the best of em and shall therefore as soon as possible tell you in person how much  i am etc  to the earl of oxford oct         your lordship may be surpised at the liberty i take in writing to you though you will allow me always to remember that you once permitted me that honor in conjunction with some others who better dedeservd it i hope you will not wonder if i am still desirous to have you think me your grateful and faithful servant but i own i have an ambition yet farther to have others think me so which is the occasion i give your lordship the trouble of this poor parnell before he died left me the charge of publishing these few remains of his i have a strong desire to make them their author and their publisher more considerable by addressing and dedicating em all to you there is a pleasure in bearing testimony to truth and a vanity perhaps which at least is as excusable as any vanity can be i beg you my lord to allow me to gratify it in prefixing this paper of honest verses to the book i send the book it self which i dare say you will receive more satisfaction in perusing than you can from any thing written upon the subject of your self therefore i am a good deal in doubt whether you will care for such an addition to it all i shall say for it is that it is the only dedication i ever writ and shall be the only one whither you accept of it or not for i will not bow the knee to a less man than my lord oxford and i expect to see no greater in my time  after all if your lordship will tell my lord harley that i must not do this you may depend upon a suppression of these verses the only copy whereof i send you but you never shall suppress that great sincere and entire respect with which i am always my lord  your etc  the earl of oxford to mr pope bramton castle nov        i received your packet which could not but give me great pleasure to see you preserve an old friend in your memory for it must needs be very agreeable to be remembered by those we highly value but then how much shame did it cause me when i read your very fine verses enclosed my mind reproached me how far short i came of what your great friendship and delicate pen would partially describe me you ask my consent to publish it to what streights does this reduce me i look back indeed to those evenings i have usefully and pleasantly spent with mr pope mr parnel dean swift the doctor etc i should be glad the world knew you admitted me to your friendship and since your affection is too hard for your judgment i am contented to let the world know how well mr pope can write upon a barren subject i return you an exact copy of the verses that i may keep the original as a testimony of the only error you have been guilty of i hope very speedily to embrace you in london and to assure you of the particular esteem and friendship wherewith i am  your etc oxford  letters of mr gay and mr pope to mr fortescue f stanton harcourt aug        the only news you can expect to have from me here is news from heaven for i am quite out of the world and there is scarce any thing can reach me except the noise of thunder which undoubtedly you have heard too we have read in old authors of high towers levelled by it to the ground while the humble valleys have escaped the only thing that is proof against it is the laurel which however i take to be no great security to the brains of modern authors but to let you see that the contrary to this often happens i must acquaint you that the highest and most extravagant heap of towers in the universe which is in this neighborhood stands still undefacd while a cock of barley in our next field has been consumed to ashes would to god that this heap of harley had been all that had perished for unhappily beneath this little shelter sat two much more constant lovers than ever were found in romance under the shade of a beechtree john hewet was a wellset man of about five and twenty sarah drew might be rather called comely than beautiful and was about the same age they had passed through the various labors of the year together with the greatest satisfaction if she milkd twas his morning and evening care to bring the cows to her hand it was but last fair that he bought her a present of green silk for her straw hat and the posie on her silver ring was of his choosing their love was the talk of the whole neighborhood for scandal never affirmed that they had any other views than the lawful possession of each other in marriage it was that very morning that he had obtained the consent of her parents and it was but till the next week that they were to wait to be happy perhaps in the intervals of their work they were now talking of the wedding clothes and john was suiting several sorts of poppys and field flowers to her complexion to choose her a knot for the wedding day while they were thus busied it was on the last of july between two or three in the afternoon the clouds grew black and such a storm of lightning and thunder ensued that all the laborers made the best of their way to what shelter the trees and hedges afforded sarah was frightened and fell down in a swoon on a heap of barley john who never separated from her sat down by her side having raked together two or three heaps the better to secure her from the storm immediately there was heard so loud a crack as if heaven had split asunder every one was solicitous for the safety of his neighbor and called to one another throughout the field no answer being returned to those who called to our lovers they stepped to the place where they lay they perceived the barley all in a smoke and then spied this faithful pair john with one arm about sarahs neck and the other held over her as to skreen her from the lightning they were both struck dead in this tender posture sarahs left eyebrow was singed and there appeared a black spot on her breast her lover was all over black but not the least signs of life were found in either attended by their melancholy companions they were conveyed to the town and the next day interred in stantonharcourt churchyard my lord harcourt at mr popes and my request has caused a stone to be placed over them upon condition that we should furnish the epitaph which is as follows when eastern lovers feed the funeral fire on the same pile the faithful fair expire here pitying heaven that virtue mutual found and blasted both that it might neither wound hearts so sincere the almighty saw well pleased sent his own lightning and the victims seized   but my lord is apprehensive the country people will not understand this and mr pope says he will make one with something of scripture in it and with as little poetry as hopkins and sternhold see the epitaph which is erected to their memory in literary correspondence vol ii page       yours etc  mr gay to mr pope aug        twas two or three weeks ago that i writ you a letter i might indeed have done it sooner i thought of you every postday upon that account and every other day upon some account or other i must beg you to give mrs blount my sincere thanks for her kind way of thinking of me which i have heard of more than once from our friend at court who seemed in the letter she writ to be in high health and spirits considering the multiplicity of pleasures and delights that one is overrun with in those places i wonder how any body has health and spirits enough to support em i am heartily glad she has and whenever i hear so i find it contributes to mine you see i am not free from dependence though i have less attendance than i had formerly for a great deal of my own welfare still depends upon hers is the widows house to be disposed of yet i have not given up my pretensions to the dean if it was to be parted with i wish one of us had it i hope you wish so too and that mrs blount and mrs howard wish the same and for the very same reason that i wish it all i could hear of you of late has been by advertisements in newspapers by which one would think the race of curls was multiplied and by the indignation such fellows show against you that you have more merit than any body alive could have homer himself has not been worse used by the french i am to tell you that the duchess makes you her compliments and is always inclined to like any thing you do that mr congreve admires with me your fortitude and loves not envies your performances for we are not dunces adieu  mr pope to mr gay oct    0 it is true that i write to you very seldom and have no pretense of writing which satisfies me because i have nothing to say that can give you much pleasure only that i am in being which in truth is of little consequence to one from whose conversation i am cut off by such accidents or engagements as separate us i continue and ever shall to wish you all good and happiness i wish that some lucky event might set you in a state of ease and independency all at once and that i might live to see you as happy as this silly world and fortune can make any one are we never to live together more as once we did i find my life ebbing apace and my affections strengthening as my age increases not that i am worse but better in my health than last winter but my mind finds no amendment nor improvement nor support to lean upon from those about me and so i feel my self leaving the world as fast as it leaves me companions i have enough friends few but those too warm in the concerns of the world for me to keep pace with or else so divided from me that they are but like the dead whose remembrance i hold in honor nature temper and habit from my youth made me have but one strong desire all other ambitions my person education constitution religion etc conspired to remove far from me that desire was to fix and preserve a few lasting dependable friendships and the accidents which have disappointed me in it have put a period to all my aims so i am sunk into an idleness which makes me neither care nor labor to be noticd by the rest of mankind i propose no rewards to my self and why should i take any sort of pains here i sit and sleep and probably here i shall sleep till i sleep for ever like the old man of verona i hear of what passes in the busy world with so little attention that i forget it the next day and as to the learned world there is nothing passes in it i have no more to add but that i am with the same truth as ever  yours etc  to the same oct       0 your letter is a very kind one but i cannot say so pleasing to me as many of yours have been through the account you give of the dejection of your spirits i wish the too constant use of water does not contribute to it i find dr arbuthnot and another very knowing physician of that opinion i also wish you were not so totally immersed in the country i hope your return to town will be a prevalent remedy against the evil of too much recollection i wish it partly for my own sake we have lived little together of late and we want to be physicians to one another it was a remedy that agreed very well with us both for many years and i fancy our constitutions would mend upon the old medicine of studiorum similitudo etc i believe we both of us want whetting there are several here who will do you that good office merely for the love of wit which seems to be bidding the town a long and last adieu i can tell you of no one thing worth reading or seeing the whole age seems resolved to justify the dunciad and it may stand for a public epitapth or monumental inscription like that at thermopylae on a whole people perished there may indeed be a wooden image or two of poetry set up to preserve the memory that there once were bards in britain and like the giants at guildhall show the bulk and bad taste of our ancestors at present the poet laureat and stephen duck serve for this purpose a drunken sot of a parson holds forth the emblem of inspiration and an honest industrious thresher not unaptly represents pains and labor i hope this phenomenon of wiltshire has appeared at amesbury or the duchess will be thought insensible to all bright qualities and exalted geniuss in court and country alike but he is a harmless man and therefore i am glad  this is all the news talked of at court but it will please you better to hear that mrs howard talks of you though not in the same breath with the thresher as they do of me by the way have you seen or conversed with mr chubb who is a wonderful phenomenon of wiltshire i have read through his whole volume with admiration of the writer though not always with approbation of the doctrine i have past just three days in london in four months two at windsor half an one at richmond and have not taken one excursion into any other country judge now whether i can live in my library adieu live mindful of one of your first friends who will be so to the last mrs blount deserves your remembrance for she never forgets you and wants nothing of being a friend  i beg the dukes and her graces acceptance of my services the contentment you express in their company pleases me though it be the bar to my own in dividing you from us i am ever very truly  your etc  to the same oct        sir clem cottrell tells me you will shortly come to town we begin to want comfort in a few friends about us while the winds whistle and the waters roar the sun gives us a parting look but it is but a cold one we are ready to change those distant favors of a lofty beauty for a gross material fire that warms and comforts more i wish you could be here till your family come to town you will live more innocently and kill fewer harmless creatures nay none except by your proper deputy the butcher it is fit for conscience sake that you should come to town and that the duchess should stay in the country where no innocents of another species may suffer by her i hope she never goes to church the duke should lock you both up and less harm would be done i advise you to make man your game hunt and beat about here for coxcombs and truss up rogues in satire i fancy they will turn to a good account if you can produce them fresh or make them keep and their relations will come and buy their bodies of you  the death of wilks leaves cibber without a colleague absolute and perpetual dictator of the stage though indeed while he lived he was but as bibulus to caesar however ambition finds something to be gratified with in a mere name or else god have mercy upon poor ambition here is a dead vacation at present no politics at court no trade in town nothing stirring but poetry every man and every boy is writing verses on the royal hermitage i hear the queen is at a loss which to prefer but for my own part i like none so well as mr poyntzs in latin you would oblige my lady suffolk if you tried your muse on this occasion i am sure i would do as much for the duchess of queensberry if she desired it several of your friends assure me it is expected from you one should not bear in mind all ones life any little indignity received from a court and therefore i am in hopes neither her grace will hinder you nor you decline it  the volume of swift and popes miscellanies vol iv miscellanies is just published which concludes all our fooleries of that kind all your friends remember you and i assure you no one more than  yours etc  mr gay to mr pope oct        i am at last returned from my somersetshire expedition but since my return i cannot so much boast of my health as before i went for i am frequently out of order with my colical complaints so as to make me uneasy and dispirited though not to any violent degree the reception we met with and the little excursions we made were every way agreeable i think the country abounds with beautiful prospects sir william wyndham is at present amusing himself with some real improvements and a great many visionary castles we were often entertained with sea views and sea fish and were at some places in the neighborhood among which i was mightily pleased with dunster castle near minehead it stands upon a great eminence and has a prospect of that town with an extensive view of the bristol channel in which are seen two small islands called the steep holms and flat holms and on the other side we could plainly distinguish the divisions of fields on the welsh coast all this journey i performed on horseback and i am very much disappointed that at present i feel my self so little the better for it i have indeed followed riding and exercise for three months successively and really think i was as well without it so that i begin to fear the illness i have so long and so often complained of is inherent in my constitution and that i have nothing for it but patience  as to your advice about writing panegyric it is what i have not frequently done i have indeed done it sometimes against my judgment and inclination and i heartily repent of it and at present as i have no desire of reward and see no just reason of praise i think i had better let it alone there are flatterers good enough to be found and i would not interfere in any gentlemans profession i have seen no verses upon these sublime occasions so that i have no emulation let the patrons enjoy the authors and the authors their patrons for i know my self unworthy  i am etc  mr pope to mr gay cirencester it is a true saying that misfortunes alone prove ones friendships they show us not only other peoples for us but our own for them we hardly know our selves any otherwise i feel my being forced to this bathjourney as a misfortune and to follow my own welfare preferably to those i love is indeed a new thing to me my health has not usually got the better of my tendernesses and affections i set out with a heavy heart wishing i had done this thing the last season for every day i defer it the more i am in danger of that accident which i dread the most my mothers death especially should it happen while i am away and another reflection pains me that i have never since i knew you been so long separated from you as i now must be methinks we live to be more and more strangers and every year teaches you to live without me this absence may i fear make my return less welcome and less wanted to you than once it seemed even after but a fortnight time ought not in reason to diminish friendship when it confirms the truth of it by experience  the journey has a good deal disordered me notwithstanding my resting place at lord bathursts my lord is too much for me he walks and is in spirits all day long i rejoice to see him so it is a right distinction that i am happier in seeing my friends so many degrees above me be it fortune health or pleasures than i can be in sharing either with them for in these sort of enjoyments i cannot keep pace with em any more than i can walk with a stronger man i wonder to find i am a companion for none but old men and forget that i am not a young fellow my self the worst is that reading and writing which i have still the greatest relish for are growing painful to my eyes but if i can preserve the good opinion of one or two friends to such a degree as to have their indulgence to my weaknesses i will not complain of life and if i could live to see you consult your ease and quiet by becoming independent on those who will never help you to either i doubt not of finding the latter part of my life pleasanter than the former or present my uneasinesses of mind is in your regard you have a temper that would make you easy and beloved which is all the happiness one needs to wish in this world and content with moderate things all your point is not to lose that temper by sacrificing your self to others out of a mistaken tenderness which hurts you and profits not them and this you must do soon or it will be too late habit will make it as hard for you to live independent as for l  to live out of a court  you must excuse me for observing what i think any defect in you you grow too indolent and give things up too easily which would be otherwise when you found and felt your self your own spirits would come in as illusage went out while you live under a kind of perpetual dejection and oppression nothing at all belongs to you not your own humor nor your own sense  you cannot conceive how much you would find resolution rise and cheerfulness grow upon you if you would once try to live independent for two or three months i never think tenderly of you but this comes across me and therefore excuse my repeating it for whenever i do not i dissemble half that i think of you adieu pray write and be particular about your health  to  your letter dated at nine a clock on tuesday night as i suppose has sunk me quite yesterday i hoped and yesterday i sent you a line or two for our poor friend gay enclosed in a few words to you about twelve or one a clock you should have had it i am troubled about that though the present cause of our trouble be so much greater mr gay died      aged    indeed i want a friend to help me to bear it better we want each other i bear a hearty share with mrs howard who has lost a man of a most honest heart so honest an one that i wish her master had none less honest about him the world after all is a little pitiful thing not performing any one promise it makes us for the future and every day taking away and annulling the joys of the past let us comfort one another and if possible study to add as much more friendship to each other as death has deprived us of in him i promise you more and more of mine which will be the way to deserve more and more of yours  i purposely avoid saying more the subject is beyond writing upon beyond cure or ease by reason or reflection beyond all but one thought that it is the will of god  so will the death of my mother be which now i tremble at now resign to now bring close to me now set farther off every day alters turns me about and confuses my whole frame of mind her dangerous distemper is again returned her fever coming onward again though less in pain for which last however i thank god  i am unfeignedly tired of the world and receive nothing to be called a pleasure in it equivalent to countervail either the death of one i have so long lived with or the loss of one i have so long lived for i have nothing left but to turn my thoughts to one comfort the last we usually think of though the only one we should in wisdom depend upon in such a disappointing place as this i sit in her room and she is always present before me but when i sleep i wonder i am so well i have shed many tears but now i weep at nothing i would above all things see you and think it would comfort you to see me so equaltemperd and so quiet but pray dine here you may and she know nothing of it for she dozes much and we tell her of no earthly thing lest it run in her mind which often trifles have done if mr bethel had time i wish he were your companion hither be as much as you can with each other be assured i love you both and be farther assured that friendship will increase as i live on  letters between the earl of peterborow mr pope dean swift etc aug         my lord i presume you may before this time be returned from the contemplation of many beauties animal and vegetable in gardens and possibly some rational in ladies to the better enjoyment of your own at bevismount i hope and believe all you have seen will only contribute to it i am not so fond of making compliments to ladies as i was twenty years ago or i would say there are some very reasonable and one in particular there i think you happy my lord in being at least half the year almost as much your own master as i am mine the whole year and with all the disadvantageous encumbrance of quality parts and honor as mere a gardener loyterer and labourer as he who never had titles or from whom they are taken i have an eye in the last of these glorious appellations to the style of a lord bolingbroke degraded or attainted methinks they give him a better title than they deprive him of in calling him labourer agricultura says tully proxima sapientiae which is more than can be said by most modern nobility of grace or right honorable which are often proxima stultitiae the great turk you know is often a gardener or of a meaner trade and are there not my lord some circumstances in which you would resemble the great turk the two paradises are not ill connected of gardens and gallantry and some there are not to name my lord bolingbroke who pretend they are both to be had even in this life without turning musselmen  we have as little politics here within a few miles of the court nay perhaps at the court as you at southampton and our ministers i dare say have less to do our weekly histories are only full of feasts given to the queen and royal family by their servants and the long and laborious walks her majesty takes every morning yet if the graver historians hereafter shall be silent of this years events the amorous and anecdotical may make posterity some amends by being furnished with the gallantries of the great at home and it is some comfort that if the men of the next age do not read of us the women may  from the time you have been absent i have not been to wait on a certain great man through modesty through idleness and through respect but for my comfort i fancy that any great man will as soon forget one that does him no harm as he can one that has done him any good believe me my lord  yours etc a pope  from the earl of peterborow i must confess that in going to lord cobhams i was not led by curiosity i went thither to see what i had seen and what i was sure to like  i had the idea of those gardens so fixed in my imagination by many descriptions that nothing surprised me immensiy and van brugh appear in the whole and in every part your joining in your letter animal and vegetable beauty makes me use this expression i confess the stately sacharissa at stow but am content with my little amoret  i thought you indeed more knowing upon the subject and wonder at your mistake why will you imagine women insensible to praise much less to yours i have seen them more than once turn from their lover to their flatterer i am sure the farmeress at bevis in her highest mortifications in the middle of her lent would feel emotions of vanity if she knew you gave her the character of a reasonabe woman  you have been guilty again of another mistake which hindered me showing your letter to a friend when you join two ladies in the same compliment though you gave to both the beauty of venus and the wit of minerva you would please neither  if you had put me into the dunciad i could not have been more disposed to criticize your letter what sir do you bring it in as a reproach or as a thing uncommon to a court to be without politics with politics indeed the richlieus and such folks have brought about great things in former days but what are they sir who without policy in our times can make ten treaties in a year and secure everlasting peace  i can no longer disagree with you though in jest o how heartily i join with you in your contempt for excellency and grace and in your esteem of that most noble title loiterer if i were a man of many plums a modern cant term for a  00000 l man  and a good heathen i would dedicate a temple to laziness no man sure could blame my choice of such a deity who considers that when i have been fool enough to take pains i always met with some wise man able to undo my labors  yours etc  mr pope to the earl of peterborow you were in a very polemic humor when you did me the honor to answer my last i always understood like a true controvertist that to answer is only to cavil and quarrel however i forgive you you did it as all polemics do to show your parts else was it not very vexatious to deny me to commend two women at a time it is true my lord you know women as well as men but since you certainly love them better why are you so uncharitable in your opinion of them surely one lady may allow another to have the thing she herself least values reason when beauty is uncontested venus her self could allow minerva to be goddess of wit when paris gave her the apple as the fool her self thought on a better account i do say that lady p is a reasonable woman and i think she will not take it amiss if i should insist upon esteeming her instead of toasting her like a silly thing i could name who is the venus of these days i see you had forgot my letter or would not let her know how much i thought of her in this reasonable way but i have been kinder to you and have shown your letter to one who would take it heartily  but for gods sake what have you said about politicians you made me a great compliment in the trust you reposed in my prudence or what mischief might not i have done you with some that affect that denomination your lordship might as safely have spoken of heroes what a bluster would the god of the winds have made had one that we know puffed against aeolus or like xerxes whipped the seas they had dialogued it in the language of the rehearsal i will give him flash for flash  i will give him dash for dash  but all now is safe the poets are preparing songs of joy and halcyondays are the word  i hope my lord it will not be long before your dutiful affection brings you to town i fear it will a little raise your envy to find all the muses employed in celebrating a royal work which your own partiality will think inferior to bevismount but if you have any inclination to be even with them you need but put three or four wits into any hole in your garden and they will outrhyme all eaton and westminster i think swift gay and i could undertake it if you dont think our heads too expensive but the same hand that did the others will do them as cheap if all else should fail you are sure at least of the head hand and heart of your servant  why should you fear any disagreeable news to reach us at mount bevis do as i do even within ten miles of london let no news whatever come near you as to public affairs we never knew a deader season it is all silent deep tranquillity indeed they say it is sometimes so just before an earthquake but whatever happens cannot we observe the wise neutrality of the dutch and let all about us fall by the ears or if you my lord should be pricked on by any oldfashioned notions of honor and romance and think it necessary for the general of the marines to be in action when our fleets are in motion meet them at spithead and take me along with you i decline no danger where the glory of great britain is concerned and will contribute to empty the largest bowl of punch that shall be rigged out on such an occasion adieu my lord and may as many years attend you as may be happy and honorable  from the earl of peterborow you must receive my letters with a just impartiality and give grains of allowance for a gloomy or rainy day i sink grievously with the weatherglass and am quite spiritless when oppressed with the thoughts of a birthday or a return  dutiful affection was bringing me to town but undutiful laziness and being much out of order keep me in the country however if alive i must make my appearance at the birthday where you showed one letter you may show the other she that never was wanting in any good office in her power will make a proper excuse where a sin of omission i fear is not reckoned as a venial sin  i consent you shall call me polemic or associate me to any sect or corporation provided you do not join me to the charitable rogues or to the pacific politicians of the present age i have read over barkleys apology for the quakers barclay in vain and find after a stroke given on the left i cannot offer the right cheek for another blow all i can bring my self to is to bear mortification from the fair sex with patience  you seem to think it vexatious that i should allow you but one woman at a time either to praise or love if i dispute with you upon this point i doubt every jury will give a verdict against me so sir with a mohammedan indulgence i allow you pluralities the favorite privilege of our church  i find you do not mend upon correction again i tell you you must not think of women in a reasonable way you know we always make goddesses of those we adore upon earth and do not all the good men tell us we must lay aside reason in what relates to the deity  it is well the poets are preparing songs of joy it is well to lay in antidotes of soft rhyme against the rough prose they may chance to meet with at westminster i should have been glad of any thing of swifts pray when you write to him next tell him i expect him with impatience in a place as odd and as much out of the way as himself  yours etc  from the same whenever you apply as a good papist to your female mediatrix you are sure of success but there is not a full assurance of your entire submission to motherchurch and that abates a little of your authority however if you will accept of country letters she will correspond from the haycock and i will write to you upon the side of my wheelbarrow surely such letters might escape examination  your idea of the golden age is that every shepherd might pipe where he pleased as i have lived longer i am more moderate in my wishes and would be content with the liberty of not piping where i am not pleased  o how i wish to my self and my friends a freedom which fate seldom allows and which we often refuse our selves why is our shepherdess in voluntary slavery why must our dean submit to the color of his coat and live absent from us and why are you confined to what you cannot relieve  i seldom venture to give accounts of my journeys beforehand because i take resolutions of going to london and keep them no better than quarrelling lovers do theirs but the devil will drive me thither about the middle of next month and i will call upon you to be sprinkled with holy water before i enter the place of corruption  your etc  from the same      i am under the greatest impatience to see dr swift at bevismount and must signify my mind to him by another hand it not being permitted me to hold correspondence with the said dean for no letter of mine can come to his hands  and whereas it is apparent in this protestant land most especially under the care of divine providence that nothing can succeed or come to a happy issue but by bribery therefore let me know what he expects to comply with my desires and it shall be remitted unto him  for though i would not corrupt any man for the whole world yet a benevolence may be given without any offense to conscience every one must confess that gratification and corruption are two distinct terms nay at worst many good men hold that for a good end some very naughty measures may be made use of  but sir i must give you some good news in relation to my self because i know you wish me well i am cured of some diseases in my old age which tormented me very much in my youth  i was possessed with violent and uneasy passions such as a peevish concern for truth and a saucy love for my country  when a christian priest preached against the spirit of the gospel when an english judge determined against magna charta when the minister acted against commonsense i used to fret  now sir let what will happen i keep my self in temper as i have no flattering hopes so i banish all useless fears but as things of this world i find my self in a condition beyond expectation it being evident from a late parliamentary enquiry that i have as much ready money as much in the funds and as great a personal estate as sir robert sttn  if the translator of homer find fault with this unheroic disposition or what i more fear if the draper of ireland accuse the englishman of want of spirit i silence you both with one line out of your own horace quid te exempta juvat spinis e pluribus una for i take the whole to be so corrupted that a cure in any part would be of little avail  yours etc  from dean swift to the earl of peterborow my lord i never knew or heard of any person so volatile and so fixed as your lordship you while your imagination is carrying you through every corner of the world where you have or have not been can at the same time remember to do offices of favor and kindness to the meanest of your friends and in all the scenes you have passed have not been able to attain that one quality peculiar to a great man of forgetting every thing but injuries of this i am a living witness against you for being the most insignificant of all your old humble servants you were so cruel as never to give me time to ask a favor but prevented me in doing whatever you thought i desired or could be for my credit or advantage  i have often admired at the capriciousness of fortune in regard to your lordship she has forced courts to act against their oldest and most constant maxims to make you a general because you had courage and conduct an ambassador because you had wisdom and knowledge in the interests of europe and an admiral on account of your skill in maritime affairs whereas according to the usual method of court proceedings i should have been at the head of the army and you of the church or rather a curate under the dean of st patricks  the archbishop of dublin laments that he did not see your lordship till he was just upon the point of leaving the bath i pray god you may have found success in that journey else i shall continue to think there is a fatality in all your lordships undertakings which only terminate in your own honor and the good of the public without the least advantage to your health or fortune  i remember lord oxfords ministry used to tell me that not knowing where to write to you they were forced to write at you it is so with me for you are in one thing an evangelical man that you know not where to lay your head and i think you have no house pray my lord write to me that i may have the pleasure in this scoundrelcountry of going about and showing my depending parsons a letter from the earl of peterborow  i am etc  to lord bathurst sept    i believe you are by this time immersed in your vast wood and one may address to you as to a very abstracted person like alexander selkirk or the the title of an arabic treatise of the life of hai ebn yocktan selftaught philosopher i should be very curious to know what sort of contemplations employ you i remember the latter of those i mentioned gave himself up to a devout exercise of making his head giddy with various circumrotations to imitate the motions of the celestial bodies i dont think it at all impossible that mr l may be far advanced in that exercise by frequent turns toward the several aspects of the heavens to which you may have been pleased to direct him in search of prospects and new avenues he will be tractable in time as birds are tamed by being whirled about and doubtless come not to despise the meanest shrubs or coppicewood though naturally he seems more inclined to admire god in his greater works the tall timber for as virgil has it non omnes arbusta juvant humilesque myricae i wish my self with you both whether you are in peace or at war in violent argumentation or smooth consent over gazettes in the morning or over plans in the evening in that last article i am of opinion your lordship has a loss of me for generally after the debate of a whole day we acquiescd at night in the best conclusion of which human reason seems capable in all great matters to fall fast asleep and so we ended unless immediate revelation which ever must overcome human reason suggested some new lights to us in a vision in bed but laying aside theory i am told you are going directly to practice alas what a fall will that be a new building is like a new church when once it is set up you must maintain it in all the forms and with all the inconveniences then cease the pleasant luminous days of inspiration and there is an end of miracles at once  that this letter may be all of a piece i will fill the rest with an account of a consultation lately held in my neighborhood about designing a princely garden the royal gardens at richmond several critics were of several opinions one declared he would not have too much art in it for my notion said he of gardening is that it is only sweeping nature another told them that gravel walks were not of a good taste for all the finest abroad were of loose sand a third advised peremptorily there should not be one lymetree in the whole plantation a fourth made the same exclusive clause extend to horsechesnuts which he affirmed not to be trees but weeds dutch elms were condemned by a fifth and thus about half the trees were proscribed contrary to the paradise of gods own planting which is expressly said to be planted with all trees there were some who could not bear evergreens and called them nevergreens some who were angry at them only when cut into shapes and gave the modern gardeners the name of evergreen tailors some who had no dislike to cones and cubes but would have em cut in foresttrees and some who were in a passion against any thing in shape even against clipped hedges which they called green walls these my lord are our men of taste who pretend to prove it by tasting little or nothing sure such a taste is like such a stomach not a good one but a weak one we have the same sort of critics in poetry one is fond of nothing but heroics another cannot relish tragedies another hates pastorals all little wits delight in epigrams will you give me leave to add we have the same in divinity where many leading critics are for rooting up more than they plant and would leave the lords vineyard either very thinly furnished or very oddly trimmed  i have lately been with my lord alludes to the letter the duke of chandos wrote to mr pope on this occasion who is a zealous yet charitable planter and has so bad a taste as to like all that is good he has a disposition to wait on you in his way to the bath and if he can go and return to london in eight or ten days i am not without a hope of seeing your lordship with the delight i always see you every where i think of you and every where i wish for you  i am etc  letters to and from several persons sir william trumbull to mr pope oct      0  i return you the book you were pleased to lend me and with it your obliging letter which deserves my particular acknowledgments for next to the pleasure of enjoying the company of so good a friend the welcomest thing to me is to hear from him i expected to find what i have met with an admirable genius in those poems not only because they were miltons lycidas lallegro ii penseroso the masque of comus       or were approved by sir henry wotton but because you had commended them and give me leave to tell you that i know no body so like to equal him even at the age he wrote most of them as your self only do not afford more cause of complaints against you that you suffer nothing of yours to come abroad which in this age wherein wit and true sense is more scarce than money is a piece of such cruelty as your friends can hardly pardon i hope you will repent and amend i could offer many reasons to this purpose and such as you cannot answer with any sincerity but that i dare not enlarge for fear of engaging in a style of compliment which has been so abused by fools and knaves that it is become almost scandalous i conclude therefore with an assurance which shall never vary  of my being ever etc w trumbull  sir william trumbull died at easthampstead in berkshire      where he has erected the following epitaph to his memory a pleasing form a firm yet cautious mind sincere though prudent constant yet resigned honor unchanged a principle professed fixed to one side but moderate to the rest an honest courtier yet a patriot too just to his prince and to his country true filled with the sense of age the fire of youth a scorn of wrangling yet a zeal for truth a generous faith from superstition free a love to peace and hate of tyranny such this man was who

literary corresp vol i octavo page     i have been lately reading jeffery of monmouth in the translation of a clergyman in my neighborhood he wanted my help to versify the prayer of brutus made when he was much in our circumstances as papists  inquiring in what land to set up his seat and worship like his fathers  goddess of woods tremendous in the chase to mountain wolves and all the savage race wide over thaerial vault extend thy sway and over the infernal regions void of day on thy third reign look down disclose our fate in what new nation shall we fix our seat when shall we next thy hallowed altars raise and choirs of virgins celebrate thy praise nb in this letter mr pope has omitted one of the late earl of oxfords political apophthegms  to a lady abroad madam i can never have too many of your letters i am angry at every scrap of paper lost and though it is but an odd compliment to compare a fine lady to a sybil your leaves methinks like hers are too good to be committed to the winds though i have no other way of receiving them but by those unfaithful messengers i have had but three and i reckon that short one from d   which was rather a dying ejaculation than a letter  you contrived to say in your last the two things most pleasing to me the first that whatever be the fate of your letters you will continue to write in the discharge of your conscience the other is the justice you do me in taking what i write to you in the serious manner it was meant it is the point upon which i can bear no suspicion and in which above all i desire to be thought serious it would be vexatious indeed if you should pretend to take that for wit which is no more than the natural overflowing of a heart improved by an esteem for you but since you tell me you believe me i fancy my expressions have not been entirely unfaithful to my thoughts  may your faith be increased in all truths that are as great as this and depend upon it to whatever degree it may extend you can never be a bigot  if you could see the heart i talk of you would really think it a foolish good kind of thing with some qualities as well deserving to be halflaughed at and half esteemed as most hearts in the world  it is grand foible in regard to you is the most like reason of any foible in nature upon my word this heart is not like a great warehouse stored only with my own goods or with empty spaces to be supplied as fast as interest or ambition can fill them but is every inch of it let out into lodgings for it is friends and shall never want a corner where your idea will always lie as warm and as close as any idea in christendom  if this distance as you are so kind to say enlarges your belief of my friendship i assure you it has so extended my notion of your value that i begin to be impious upon that account and to wish that even slaughter ruin and desolation may interpose between you and the place you design for and that you were restored to us at the expense of a whole people  is there no expedient to return you in peace to the bosom of your country i hear you are come as far as  do you only look back to die twice is eurydice once more snatched to the shade if ever mortal had reason to hate the king it is i whose particular misfortune it is to be almost the only innocent person he has made to suffer both by his government at home and his negotiations abroad  if you must go from us i wish at least you might pass to your banishment by the most pleasant way that all the road might be roses and myrtles and a thousand objects rise round you agreeable enough to make england less desirable to you it is not now my interest to wish england agreeable it is highly probable it may use me ill enough to drive me from it can i think that place my country where i cannot now call a foot of paternal earth my own yet it may seem some alleviation that when the wisest thing i can do is to leave my country what was most agreeable in it should first be snatched away from it  i could overtake you with pleasure in  and make that tour in your company every reasonable entertainment and beautiful view would be doubly engaging when you partook of it i should at least attend you to the sea coasts and cast a last look after the sails that transported you but perhaps i might care as little to stay behind you and be full as uneasy to live in a country where i saw others persecuted by the rogues of my own religion as where i was persecuted my self by the rogues of yours and it is not impossible i might run into asia in search of liberty for who would not rather live a freeman among a nation of slaves than a slave among a nation of freemen  in good earnest if i knew your motions and your exact time i verily think i should be once more happy in a sight of you next spring  i will conclude with a wish god send you with us or me with you  to mrs blount      madam the weather is too fine for any one that loves the country to leave it at this season when every smile of the sun like the smile of a coy lady is as dear as it is uncommon and i am so much in the taste of rural pleasures i had rather see the sun than any thing he can show me except yourself i despise every fine thing in town not excepting your new gown till i see you dressed in it which by the way i dont like the better for the red the leaves i think are very pretty i am growing fit i hope for a better world of which the light of the sun is but a shadow for i doubt not but gods works here are what comes nearest to his works there and that a true relish of the beauties of nature is the most easy preparation and gentlest transition to an enjoyment of those of heaven as on the contrary a true town life of hurry confusion noise slander and dissension is a sort of apprenticeship to hell and it is furies i am endeavoring to put my mind into as quiet a situation as i can to be ready to receive that stroke which i believe is coming upon me and have fully resigned my self to yield to it the separation of my soul and body is what i could think of with less pain for i am very sure he that made it will take care of it and in whatever state he pleases it shall be that state must be right but i cannot think without tears of being separated from my friends when their condition is so doubtful that they may want even such assistance as mine sure it is more merciful to take from us after death all memory of what we loved or pursued here for else what a torment would it be to a spirit still to love those creatures it is quite divided from unless we suppose that in a more exalted life all that we esteemed in this imperfect state will affect us no more than what we loved in our infancy concerns us now  this is an odd way of writing to a lady and i am sensible would throw me under a great deal of ridicule were you to show this letter among your acquaintance but perhaps you may not your self be quite a stranger to this way of thinking i heartily wish your life may be so long and so happy as never to let you think quite so far as i am now led to do but to think a little toward it is what will make you the happier and the easier at all times  there are no pleasures or amusements that i dont wish you and therefore it is no small grief to me that i shall for the future be less able to partake with you in them but let fortune do her worst whatever she makes us lose as long as she never makes us lose our honesty and our independence i despise from my heart whoever parts with the first and i pity from my soul whoever quits the latter  i am grieved at mr gays condition in this last respect of dependence he has merit good nature and integrity three qualities that i fear are too often lost upon great men or at least are not all three a match for that one which is opposed to them flattery i wish it may not soon or late displace him from the favor he now possesses and seems to like  i am etc  to a lady on sincere letters madam i am not at all concerned to think that this letter may be less entertaining than some i have sent i know you are a friend that will think a kind letter as good as a diverting one he who gives you his mirth makes a much less present than he who gives you his heart and true friends would rather see such thoughts as they communicate only to one another than what they squander about to all the world they who can set a right value upon any thing will prize one tender wellmeant word above all that ever made them laugh in their lives if i did not think so of you i should never have taken much pains to endeavor to please you by writing or any thing else wit i am sure i want at least in the degree that i see others have it who would at all seasons alike be entertaining but i would willingly have some qualities that may be at some seasons of more comfort to my self and of more service to my friends i would cut off my own head if it had nothing better than wit in it and tear out my own heart if it had no better dispositions than to love only my self and laugh at all my neighbors  i know you will think it an agreeable thing to hear that i have done a great deal of homer if it be tolerable the world may thank you for it for if i could have seen you every day and imagined my company could have every day pleased you i should scarce have thought it worth my while to please the world how many verses could i gladly have left unfinished and turned into it for people to say what they would of had i been permitted to pass all those hours more pleasingly whatever some may think fame is a thing i am much less covetous of than your friendship for that i hope will last all my life the other i cannot answer for what if they should both grow greater after my death alas they would both be of no advantage to me therefore think upon it and love me as well as ever you can while i live  to the hon mrs  on the same subject all the pleasure or use of familiar letters is to give us the assurance of a friends welfare at least it is all i know who am a mortal enemy and despiser of what they call fine letters in this view i promise you it will always be a satisfaction to me to write letters and to receive them from you because i unfeignedly have your good at my heart and am that thing which many people make only a subject to display their fine sentiments upon a friend which is a character that admits of little to be said till something may be done now let me fairly tell you i dont like your style it is very pretty therefore i dont like it and if you writ as well as voiture i would not give a farthing for such letters unless i were to sell em to be printed methinks i have lost the mrs l  i formerly knew who writ and talked like other people and sometimes better you must allow me to say you have not said a sensible word in all your letter except where you speak of showing kindness and expecting it in return but the addition you make about your being but two and twenty is again in the style of wit an abomination to show you how very unsatisfactorily you write in all your letters you have never told me how you did indeed i see twas absolutely necessary for me to write to you before you continued to take more notice of me for i ought to tell you what you are to expect that is to say kindness which i never failed i hope to return and not wit which if i want i am not much concerned because judgment is a better thing and if i had i would make use of it rather to play upon those i despised than to trifle with those i loved you see in short after what manner you may most agreeably write to me tell me you are my friend and you can be no more at a loss about that article as i have opened my mind upon this to you it may also serve for mr h  who will see by it what manner of letters he must expect if he corresponds with me as i am too seriously yours and his servant to put turns upon you instead of good wishes so in return i should have nothing but honest plain how dyes and pray remember mes which not being fit to be shown to any body for wit may be a proof we correspond only for our selves in mere friendliness as does god is my witness  your very etc  from dr arbuthnot london sept        i am extremely obliged to you for taking notice of a poor old distressed courtier commonly the most despiseable thing in the world this blow has so roused scriblerus that he has recovered his senses and thinks and talks like other men from being frolicksome and gay he is turned grave and morose his lucubrations lie neglected amongst old newspapers cases petitions and abundance of unanswerable letters i wish to god they had been amongst the papers of a noble lord earl of sunderland sealed up then might scriblerus have passed for the pretender and it would have been a most excellent and laborious work for the flying post or sum such author to have allegorizd all his adventures into a plot and found out mysteries somewhat like the key to the lock martins office is now the second door on the left hand in doverstreet where he will be glad to see dr parnel mr pope and his old friends to whom he can still afford a half pint of claret it is with some pleasure that he contemplates the world still busy and all mankind at work for him i have seen a letter from dean swift he keeps up his noble spirit and though like a man knocked down you may behold him still with a stern countenance and aiming a blow at his adversaries i will add no more being in haste only that i will never forgive you if you dont use my foresaid house in doverstreet with the same freedom as you did that in st jamess for as our friendship was not begun upon the relation of a courtier so i hope it will not end with it i will always be proud to be reckoned amongst the number of your friends and humble servants  to mr c sept        i assure you i am glad of your letter and have long wanted nothing but the permission you now give me to be plain and unreserved upon this head i wrote to you concerning it long since but a friend of yours and mine was of opinion it was taking too much upon me and more than i could be entitled to by the mere merit of long acquaintance and good will i have not a thing in my heart relating to any friend which i would not in my own nature declare to all mankind the truth is what you guess i could not esteem your conduct to an object of misery so near you as mrs  and i have often hinted it to your self the truth is i cannot yet esteem it for any reason i am able to see but this i promise i acquit you as far as your own mind acquits you i have now no farther cause of complaint for the unhappy lady gives me now no farther pain she is no longer an object either of yours or my compassion the hardships done her are lodged in the hands of god nor has any man more to do in them except the persons concerned in occasioning them  as for the interruption of our correspondence i am sorry you seem to put the test of my friendship upon that because it is what i am disqualifyd from toward my other acquaintance with whom i cannot hold any frequent commerce i will name you the obstacles which i cannot surmount want of health want of time want of good eyes and one yet stronger than all i write not upon the terms of other men for however glad i might be of expressiug my respect opening my mind or venting my concerns to my private friends i hardly dare while there are curlls which in all probability may be as long as there are popes in the world if you please to reflect either on the impertinence of weak admirers the malice of low enemies the avarice of mercenary booksellers or the silly curiosity of people in general you will confess i have small reason to indulge correspondencies in which too i want materials as i live altogether out of town and have abstracted my mind i hope to better things than common news i wish my friends would send me back those forfeitures of my discretion commit to my justice what i trusted only to their indulgence and return me at the years end those trifling letters which can be to them but a days amusement but to me may prove a discredit as lasting and extensive as the aforesaid weak admirers mean enemies mercenary scriblers or curious simpletons can make it  i come now to a particular you complain of my not answering your question about some party papers and their authors this indeed i could not tell you because i never was or will be privy to such papers and if by accident through my acquaintance with any of the writers i had known a thing they concealed i should certainly never be the reporter of it  for my waiting on you at your country house i have often wished it it was my compliance to a superior duty that hindered me and one which you are too good a christian to wish i should have broken having never ventured to leave my mother at her great age for more than a week which is too little for such a journey  upon the whole i must acquit myself of any act or thought in prejudice to the regard i owe you as so long and obliging an acquaintance and correspondent i am sure i have all the good wishes for yourself and your family that become a friend there is no accident that can happen to your advantage and no action that can redound to your credit which i should not be ready to extol or to rejoice in and therefore i beg you to be assured i am in disposition and will though not so much as i would be in testimonies or writings  yours etc  to mr jervas twickenham june  0      as i know you and i mutually desire to see one another i hoped that this day our wishes would have met and brought you hither and this for the very reason which possibly might hinder your coming that my poor mother is dead i thank god her death was as easy as her life was innocent and as it cost her not a groan or even a sigh there is yet upon her countenance such an expression of tranquillity nay almost of pleasure that far from horrid it is even amiable to behold it it would afford the finest image of a saint expired that ever painting drew and it would be the greatest obligation which even that obliging art could ever bestow on a friend if you could come and sketch it for me i am sure if there be no very prevalent obstacle you will leave any common business to do this and i hope to see you this evening as late as you will or to morrow morning as early before this winterflower is faded i will defer her interment till to morrow night i know you love me or i could not have written this  i could not at this time have written at all  adieu may you dye as happily  your etc  to  from lord bathursts seat  sept        you cannot think how melancholy this place makes me every part of this wood puts into my mind poor mr gay with whom i past once a great deal of pleasant time in it and another friend who is near dead and quite lost to us dr swift i really can find no enjoyment in the place the same sort of uneasiness as i find at twitnam whenever i pass near my mothers room  i have not yet writ to mrs g i think i should but have nothing to say that will answer the character they consider me in as a wit besides my eyes grow very bad whatever is the cause of it i will put em out for no body but a friend and i protest it brings tears into them almost to write to you when i think of your state and mine i long to write to swift but cannot the greatest pain i know is to say things so very short of ones meaning when the heart is full  i feel the goings out of life fast enough to have little appetite left to make compliments at best useless and for the most part unfelt speeches it is but in a very narrow circle that friendship walks in this world and i care not to tread out of it more than i needs must knowing well it is but to two or three if quite so many that any mans welfare or memory can be of consequence the rest i believe i may forget and be pretty certain they are already even if not beforehand with me  life after the first warm heats are over is all downhill and one almost wishes the journeys end provided we were sure but to lie down easy whenever the night shall overtake us  i dreamed all last night of  she has dwelt a little more than perhaps is right upon my spirits i saw a very deserving gentleman in my travels who has formerly i have heard had much the same misfortune and with all his good breeding and sense still bears a cloud and melancholy cast that never can quite clear up in all his behavior and conversation i know another who i believe could promise and easily keep his word never to laugh in his life but one must do ones best not to be used by the world as that poor lady was by her sister and not seem too good for fear of being thought affected or whimsical  it is a real truth that to the last of my moments he thought of you and the best of my wishes for you will attend you told or untold i could wish you had once the constancy and resolution to act for your self whether before or after i leave you the only way i ever shall leave you you must determine but reflect that the first would make me as well as your self happier the latter could only make you so  adieu  parodie on the

and gallant by william walsh esquire  preface it has been so usual among modern authors to write prefaces that a man is thought rude to his reader who does not give him some account before hand of what he is to expect in the book that which may make somewhat of this kind more necessary in my case than others is that a great part of this collection consists of familiar letters which sort of writing some learned persons among us have thought unfit to be published it must be confessed indeed that a great beauty of letters does often consist in little passages of private conversation and references to particular matters that can be understood by none but those to whom they are written but to draw a general conclusion from thence that familiar letters can please none but those very persons is to conclude against the common experience of all the world since besides the great applauses have been given the letters of cicero and pliny among the romans we see no book has been better received among the spaniards than the letters of guevare or among the french than those of voiture and balsac not to mention the italians among whom there has been hardly any considerable man who has not published letters with good success what may have contributed very much to the kind reception these things have met is that there is no sort of writing so necessary for people to understand as this a man may have a great deal of wit without being able to write verses or make harangues and may live in very good repute without having occasion of doing either but a man can hardly live in the world without being able to write letters there is no state of life in which a faculty of that kind is not requisite and there are few days pass in which a man has not occasion to make use of it  the style of letters ought to be free easy and natural as near approaching to familiar conversation as possible the two best qualities in conversation are good humor and good breeding those letters are therefore certainly the best that show the most of those two qualities there are some men so surly so illnatured and so illbred that though we can hardly deny them to have wit yet we can say at least that we are sorry they have it and indeed as their wit is troublesome to other people so i can hardly imagine of what great use it can be to themselves for if the end of wit be not to render ones self agreeable i shall scarce envy them any other use they can make of it  the second part of this collection consists of amorous verses those who are conversant with the writings of the ancients will observe a great difference between what they and the moderns have published upon this subject the occasions upon which the poems of the former are written are such as happen to every man almost that is in love and the thoughts such as are natural for every man in love to think the moderns on the other hand have sought out for occasions that none meet with but themselves and fill their verses with thoughts that are surprising and glittering but not tender passionate or natural to a man in love  to judge which of these two are in the right we ought to consider the end that people propose in writing loveverses and that i take not to be the getting fame or admiration from the world but the obtaining the love of their mistress and the best way i conceive to make her love you is to convince her that you love her now this certainly is not to be done by forced conceits far fetched similes and shining points but by a true and lively representation of the pains and thoughts attending such a passion si vis me flere dolendum est primum ipsi tibi tunc tua me infortunia laedent   i would as soon believe a widow in great grief for her husband because i saw her dance a corant about his coffin as believe a man in love with his mistress for his writing such verses as some great modern wits have done upon theirs  i am satisfied that catullus tibullus propertius and ovid were in love with their mistresses while they upbraid them quarrel with them threaten them and forswear them but i confess i cannot believe petrarch in love with his when he writes conceits upon her name her gloves and the place of her birth i know it is natural for a lover in transports of jealousy to treat his mistress with all the violence imaginable but i cannot think it natural for a man who is much in love to amuse himself with such trifles as the other i am pleased with tibullus when he says he could live in a desert with his mistress where never any human footsteps appeared because i doubt not but he really thinks what he says but i confess i can hardly forbear laughing when petrarch tells us he could live without any other sustenance than his mistresss looks i can very easily believe a man may love a woman so well as to desire no company but hers but i can never believe a man can love a woman so well as to have no need of meat and drink if he may look upon her the first is a thought so natural for a lover that there is no man really in love but thinks the same thing the other is not the thought of a man in love but of a man who would impose upon us with a pretended love and that indeed very grossly too while he had really none at all  it would be endless to pursue this point and any man who will but give himself the trouble to compare what the ancients and moderns have said upon the same occasions will soon perceive the advantage the former have over the others i have chosen to mention petrarch only as being by much the most famous of all the moderns who have written loveverses and it is indeed the great reputation which he has gotten that has given encouragement to this false sort of wit in the world for people seeing the great credit he had and has indeed to this day not only in italy but over all europe have satisfied themselves with the imitation of him never enquiring whether the way he took was the right or not  there are no modern writers perhaps who have succeeded better in loveverses than the english and it is indeed just that the fairest ladies should inspire the best poets never was there a more copious fancy or greater reach of wit than what appears in dr done nothing can be more gallant or genteel than the poems of mr waller nothing more gay or sprightly than those of sir john suckling and nothing fuller of variety and learning than mr cowleys however it may be observed that among all these that softness tenderness and violence of passion which the ancients thought most proper for loveverses is wanting and at the same time that we must allow dr done to have been a very great wit mr waller a very gallant writer sir john suckling a very gay one and mr cowley a great genius yet methinks i can hardly fancy any one of them to have been a very great lover and it grieves me that the ancients who could never have handsomer women than we have should nevertheless be so much more in love than we are but it is probable the great reason of this may be the cruelty of our ladies for a man must be imprudent indeed to let his passion take very deep root when he has no reason to expect any sort of return to it and if it be so there ought to be a petition made to the fair that they would be pleased sometimes to abate a little of their rigor for the propagation of good verse i do not mean that they should confer their favors upon none but men of wit that would be too great a confinement indeed but that they would admit them upon the same foot with other people and if they please now and then to make the experiment i fancy they will find entertainment enough from the very variety of it  there are three sorts of poems that are proper for love pastorals elegies and lyric verses under which last i comprehend all songs odes sonnets madrigals and stanzas of all these pastoral is the lowest and upon that account perhaps most proper for love since it is the nature of that passion to render the soul soft and humble these three sorts of poems ought to differ not only in their numbers but in the designs and in every thought of them though we have no difference between the verses of pastoral and elegy in the modern languages yet the numbers of the first ought to be looser and not so sonorous as the other the thoughts more simple more easy and more humble the design ought to be the representing the life of a shepherd not only by talking of sheep and fields but by showing us the truth sincerity and innocence that accompanies that sort of life for though i know our masters theocritus and virgil have not always conformed in this point of innocence theocritus in his daphnis having made his love too wanton and virgil in his alexis placed his passion upon a boy yet if we may be allowed to censure those whom we must always reverence i take both those things to be faults in their poems and should have been better pleased with the alexis if it had been made to a woman and with the daphnis if he had made his shepherds more modest when i give humility and modesty as the character of pastoral it is not however but that a shepherd may be allowed to boast of his pipe his songs his flocks and to show a contempt of his rival as we see both theocritus and virgil do but this must be still in such a manner as if the occasion offered itself and was not sought and proceeded rather from the violence of the shepherds passion than any natural pride or maliee in him  there ought to be the same difference observed between pastorals and eligies as between the life of the country and the court in the first love ought to be represented as among shepherds in the other as among gentlemen they ought to be smooth clear tender and passionate the thoughts may be bold more gay and more elevated than in pastoral the passions they represent either more gallant or more violent and less innocent than the others the subjects of them prayers praises expostulations quarrels reconcilements threatenings jealousies and in fine all the natural effects of love  lyrics may be allowed to handle all the same subjects with elegy but to do it however in a different manner an elegy ought to be so entirely one thing and every verse ought so to depend upon the other that they should not be able to subsist alone or to make use of the words of a my lord mulgrave great modern critic there must be  a just coherence made between each thought and the whole model laid so right that every step may higher rise like goodly mountains till they reach the skies lyrics on the other hand though they ought to make one body as well as elegy yet may consist of parts that are entire of themselves it being a rule in modern languages that every stanza ought to make up a complete sense without running into the other frequent sentences which are accounted faults in elegies are beauties here besides this malherb and the french poets after him have made it a rule in the scanzas of six lines to make a pause at the third and in those of ten lines at the third and the seventh and it must be confessed that this exactness renders them much more musisical and harmonious though they have not always been so religious in observing the latter rule as the former  but i am engaged in a very vain or a very foolish design those who are critics it would be a presumption in me to pretend i could instruct those who are not at the same time i write myself is if i may be allowed to apply another mans simile like selling arms to an enemy in time of war though there ought perhaps to be more indulgence shown to things of love and gallantry than any others because they are generally written when people are young and intended for ladies who are not supposed to be very old and all young people especially of the fair sex are more taken with the liveliness of fancy than the correctness of judgment it may be also observed that to write of love well a man must be really in love and to correct his writings well he must be out of love again i am well enough satisfied i may be in circumstances of writing of love but i am almost in despair of ever being in circumstances of correcting it this i hope may be a reason for the fair and the young to pass over some of the faults and as for the grave and wise all the favor i shall beg of them is that they would not read them things of this nature are calculated only for the former if loveverses work upon the ladies a man will not trouble himself with what the critics say of them and if they do not all the commendations the critics can give him will make but very little amends all i shall say for these trifles is that i pretend not to vie with any man whatsoever i doubt not but there are several now living who are able to write better upon all subjects than i am upon any one but i will take the boldness to say that there is no one man among them all who shall be readier to acknowledge his own faults or to do justice to the merits of other people  st jamess      letters amorous and gallant letter i to two masks though i cannot boast much of particularity to the person i love yet as to the love it self i may safely say it is one of the most particular under the sun others think it enough to fall in love with a lady after having seen her i am in love with two without having ever seen either not that i would willingly admit two tyrants into my heart but though one of you may perhaps be monarch there yet neither you nor i knowing which it is the matter must rest in doubt till another opportunity for he who condemned paris as too bold a man in daring to judge of the three goddesses beauties when he saw them naked would have thought me a bold one indeed if i should pretend to make a judgment between two ladies in masks consider a little under what difficulty you make me labor if i should commend the color of your hair and it was all the while deep red the smoothness and delicacy of your skins when they were rough and tawney the fineness of your shapes while you were stuck up within iron bodice the brightness of your eyes and they should prove bleared and squinting do but imagine when i had done this what sort of an effect it would have upon you whatever inconveniences of this nature happen it is your own faults for my part i leave this encountering with helmets over their faces to sir amadis alluding to a very old french romance called amadis de gaul and his knights errant the way of duelling is altered people do not only encounter barefaced but strip when they go to it as for this way i can assure you i find it not in the least fair and had rather be in love with the most hardhearted beauty living than continue in this uncertain state and neither know what i love why i love nor whether i love or no take pity ladies upon a lover in distress clear the business to me and let me know if i am in good earnest when i profess mysel  your most passionate admirer  letter ii to one of the former it is by faith alone that i fancy you the most charming but i find by experience you are one of the most unreasonable ladies under the sun i concluded i had done the boldest action in the world to declare a passion to two masks but you madam set up a title of your own and are not satisfied without particularity and constancy your charms i confess madam as far as i saw of them are very great the masque was very good genoa velvet the gloves very good blois gloves and the hackneycoach for aught i know lined with very good green plush now madam though so far i do steadfastly believe yet to fall constantly and particularly in love with masks gloves or hackneycoaches is what i do not find a precedent for in any of the french romances and being naturally diffident of myself i should be loath to begin a new sort of gallantry without knowing how it would take consider madam a little better upon the reasonableness of your request for particularity and constancy are very hardly to be answered for at our years the authors age about     it is i doubt not madam in your power to blow my love up to that height whenever you please and to confess a truth to you i have a very great stock of particularity and constancy lying upon my hands at this time and know not how to apply it i have all the reason in the world to imagine it is kept for you but however madam it would be necessary to have one view of you before i can be positive in that point i am satisfied in my conscience that i have done all my duty in the thing let it lie at your door if the humor break off for my part i cannot imagine how you will be able to answer it to all the world if you should for want of discovering yourself lose the most constant and most faithful lover under the sun  letter iii to the same constancy and fidelity are without doubt great virtues though not always great charms in a mistress but as to your invisibility it is a quality that does not please me at all i grant you madam it is a pretty aereal sort of beauty and may do very well for spiritual lovers but for me madam who am a little embarrassed with matter and who generally carry a body of six foot long about with me it would be convenient to have some more corporeal accomplishents descend madam in this case to your lovers capacity and make use of his senses to represent you as charming as without doubt you are to his imagination for though i must confess fancy has been very kind to you in this point yet it would be convenient to call in the help of the eyes to strengthen the evidence i expect therefore from your next letter an appointment where i may meet you in a visible manner these are the only terms upon which i can treat any farther with you for though you write the most agreeably in the world yet you must certainly own that after having been monstrously in love for a whole week together it is very reasonable a man should know at last with whom it is  letter iv to the same yes really madam i think you are in the right of it hanging and drowning are such vulgar ways of dying that for my part i would rather live a thousand years than make use of either then madam they are the most inconvenient methods in the world drowning will spoil your clothes and hanging your complexion besides several other things that might be said to dissuade you from it but that i know a word to the wise is enough i am of opinion you had better defer all sort of dying till another opportunity though you are positive in it i would rather recommend mr boyles airpump as a newer invention or being poisoned in perfumes is somewhat that looks pleasant enough but to be less serious madam make no doubt of your own perfections and reckon that in having me you have the most reasonable lover of an unreasonable lover in the world i confess were i to form a beauty to myself  she should be  let me consider a little upon it she should be  i protest madam i know not what she should be monstrously in love with me that is certain for the rest i should trust the stars i think i may say without flattery i love my self so well that i can love any body else that does so too and should prefer that single beauty of an immoderate passion for me in a mistress to all the other charms in the world as bays does the single beating of armies in his hero to all the moral virtues put together if you can answer for the charm madam take no care for any other he must be unreasonable indeed who is not satisfied with that in a lady of sixteen  letter v to the fair unbeliever st jerome says st jerome i must confess is a verv odd beginning of a billet doux that a man who can with patience suffer himself to be called heretic ought not to be esteemed a good christian and in common account you see one who is called coward if he does not resent the affront shall always be thought such as my provocations are much greater than either of these so if my indignation were answerable to them you could not expect to be forgiven by me even in the article of death for after all people can say of heretics and cowards they will allow them to be men but by your reflections upon me you would degrade me from that rank without allowing me any place among the inferior creatures had you called me brute or beast i had not been so zealous in my own justification daily experience convinces us that men who have no more understanding than horses or mules provided they have all the other qualifications of those noble animals may be acceptable enough to some or other of the fair sex but want of virility is an imputation that will cut a man off from all sort of communication with them had the husbands or old women had this opinion of me i should not have been so violent in my own defense scandals as well as oaths ought to be taken in the sense of those that impose them i should not be angry at a turk or a jew for thinking me of their religion because whatever i thought it was what made them like me the better but this would be no reason to make me forgive a christian for calling me so in like manner madam though i could have pardoned the husbands and old women for saying such a thing of me yet i can very hardly pardon you for it it were in vain to call witnesses in this case or turn you over to another hand for satisfaction in that point which can only properly be resolved by my self and it were as vain to think to clear myself by words from an imputatian that ought to be done by actions i shall therefore only challenge you to meet me at your own place and time where i doubt not to give you full satisfaction in this point and convince you that i am not the man or rather indeed the noman that you take me to be in the mean time i shall remain your most humble a curse on that humble but i mean  madam your most affectionate and passionate lover and servant  letter vi to the same i have been waiting these three months to tell you a thing that may be said in three words it is i love you i will grant you madam that this is no necessary reason why you should love me again but you must grant me in recompense that it is a very sufficient reason why i should tell you of it i do not expect you should write me a letter in return to this and therefore venture it without a name it is from your eyes alone i shall attend my answer but madam that we may not mistake one another in this point and that i may not take for an encouragement of my passion what you intend for a discouragement of it i must tell you that if you do not look upon me after this i shall believe you are in love and that makes you bashful if you look angrily i shall think it is to give me occasion to come and justify my self and if you look negligently i shall conclude it is management to disguise the amor from the world in fine madam i shall take nothing for a refusal of my heart but looking very kindly upon me but that you may not be mistaken in the person who sends this and imagine it to come from some lord which a blue garter or white staff it comes from a commoner without either i will describe my self so as you may know me well enough to encourage my passion if you like it but not so as to make a trophy of me if you do not my stature is somewhat above the ordinary my body neither very large nor very small my hair light my eyes dark and love has not as yet made me either very lean or very pale my humor is the most commodious for a lover in the world not so much inclined to hanging or drowning perhaps as some others but for passion and constancy no man goes beyond me if you will accept of a heart with all these qualifications i offer you mine if not send it me back by the pennypost if you know me by any other title than that of  your most humble servant  letter vii to the same i grant you madam there are others who will love you as much as i but are there any who will love you as little yes madam i understand very well what i say will they love you as little for that is the only difficulty you have to apprehend there is no question but a man who is possessed of the most charming creature in the universe will be constant to her as long as she pleases but it is a great question if he will part with her as soon as she pleases this is the rock upon which those ladies split who will admit of none but constant lovers not considering that the women are as changeable as the men can be for the lives of them and consider pray into what pretty circumstances a lady brings herself who is plagued with an obstinate old lover when she is passionately in love with a new one i know not what those crimes are the lady you tell me lays to my charge but i fancy an importunate perseverance in love of the same woman is not one of the number and whenever you please to make the experiment as the least sign in the world is sufficient after these preliminaries to make me a most passionate lover so the least sign you give me afterward of any new amor shall make me lay aside that title for the less ambitious one of  your most humble servant  letter viii to a lady who had spoken against him there may have been other men perhaps besides my self who have fallen in love with a woman they did not know but for a man to do it for no other reason than her declaring against him is i believe an honor that has been reserved for your humble servant they tell me madam you are so far from liking me your self that you will not believe any body else can that you find nothing agreeable in my person from the crown of my head to the sole of my foot that for my wit for every body madam carries somewhat about them which they call wit it is all affectation that i am an abstract of vanity that i am so much in love with my self that it is impossible for me to be so with any body else these things madam that might have put some people into anger have put me into love for as those who are naturally peevish will be angry at people let them endeavor ever so much to please them so we who are naturally amorous cannot avoid being in love with a lady let her take ever so much pains to anger us and indeed madam did people ground their passion upon reason you have given me one of the most reasonable causes to love you in the world for as there is no man of wit but knows himself to be a fool so he ought to have an opinion of their judgments who find it out as well as himself it is reported as an instance of the bravery of the amazons that they would never marry a man till they had fought with him first and if he beat them very much he might expect to be loved very much by them now i madam who profess as great a veneration for wit as the amazons had for courage cannot have so good a reason for love as your having exercised your wit upon me tho it is possible you may attribute my passion to another cause and as you think i love nothing besides my self may have some kindness for you because you are never like to be my rival however assure your self madam it is no such thing but knowing the worst you can say of me to be true and having a natural affection for truth wit and women you will think a man a very general lover that can love truth wit and women at the same time i must needs be infinitely in love with you in whom i find them all together be not however deluded into a better opinion of me by what any body can say for as it is only your hating me that makes me love you as soon as that ceases i am afraid my love will do so too as you therefore value my kindness take heed of having any for me and satisfy your self that as long as you continue to think me a silly idle conceited fop i shall continue to be with all the passion imaginable  madam yours etc  letter ix to a masqud lady tho i doubt not madam but you have made the most considerable conquests under the sun yet give me leave to say you never made any so extraordinary as this before you have subdued without the conquerors common vanity of making your self known and have gained the most absolute victory in the world without so much as unsheathing your face i who never knew a woman could overcome me am now overcome by i know not who and can both boast of the greatest passion and greatest faith in nature together the seeing you which is the reason of other peoples love might for aught i know destroy mine for i have raised ideas of you to which it is very difficult for any thing in nature to arrive i imagine you the most charming creature in the universe and at the same time fancy you to be somewhat more than i imagine i have dressed you up in all the different shapes of nature in whatever you appear it has been always the most amiable and after having supposed you maid wife and widow by turns i find i can love you infinitely be you any one of them did i know in which state you were i would certainly make love to all of it till i arrived at you and for want of that i am forced to confine myself to womankind i leave it to your own conscience madam whether you can leave the most constant lover in nature in this condition though if it feel no remorse for the last disappointment i shall very hardly ever trust it more yet however extravagant my passion is do not apprehend that i should make any malicious reflections on you to the world let my other virtues be what they will my fidelity is unquestionable and assure yourself there is no man breathing less apt to tell a secret that he does not know than  madam yours etc  letter x to a friend sir for friend i can hardly call you since under that disguise you have done me one of the greatest injuries in the world and it is vain for me to guard my territories against the malicious designs of enemies and rivals when you whom i never took for either have more prejudiced me in an amor than they could with all their forces together but that i may not condemn you without a cause nor conclude you guilty till i hear what you can say in your own justification i will give you a plain account of the business meeting one of the ladies last night with whom i am in love she began a discourse of lovers wherein she showed the many inconveniences that attend the having a man of wit in that capacity i who do naturally love to dispute with a fair lady especially in a cause where i thought my self no more concerned than if she had talked of jews or mahometans agreed with her in all she said when she turned briskly upon me and told me for that reason a woman must have a care of having any thing to do with me i told her that was acting after the manner of some late judges call a thing treason without law and then hang a man for it without proof this just remark alludes to the severities used in onmouths rebellion that i appealed to all the world for my innocence in the matter and defied my greatest enemies to bring any evidence of my guilt she told me she had it from such a one who had it from another and that in fine the original author of this calumny was your self now tho i grant you that some people might have said such a thing as this out of inadvertency yet i can hardly believe a man of your prudence to have done it upon that account you who very well know that to commend a man for a wit to the women is like commending him for a good protestant to the fathers of the inquisition and he that reported me an eunuch among them could not do it upon a more malicious account they love a tame easy governable fool and fancy all wits illnatured and proud have not you often told me so and after that to put me upon them for one well sir i am a gentleman nor shall i pass by such a thing as this without satisfaction i expect therefore you should either give it under your hand that you never said any such thing of me or if you really said it that you should go immediately to the person to whom you did it and assure them you were misinformed in the thing and that to your knowledge ireland it self never bred a more tame easy fool than i am for here lies the greatest danger i have gotten a rival of that country and you know how difficult it is to succeed in a contest with one of them when want of wit to give is the preference after all methinks if you would be hearty in the thing you may bring me out of these difficulties i know you have wit enough to convince them that i have none and if the worst come to the worst it is but carrying you to them to show the difference in that hopes i resume the title of  yours etc  letter xi to a lady in the country who was going to be married after having written you a letter upon your first going down i have never dared to venture one since lest i should be mistaken in my address and for aught i know to write to you now by the title of mrs  may be as uncivil as to treat the king with the title of prince of orange however madam blame not me for it since we are here in perfect ignorance of the matter we had very positive news one while of your being married and as positive after that it was not yet done which some here took i can assure you for a great act of mercy half a dozen sparks of your acquaintance have provided themselves either with lovesongs or epithalamiums to send you as occasion shall require without being yet able to know which would be most proper and here are half a dozen more who have had halters about their necks ever since the report of your going to be married for they are resolved to be ready upon the first notice that the same post which brings the news of your wedding may carry back that of their deaths it is true madam i took the boldness to advise them not to be overhasty in the affair since they might do it afterward at their own convenience and experiments of this nature were difficult enough to correct when they were once ill done but all i could say was in vain they are positive in the matter and half a dozen of the handsomest trees in the park are marked out for the execution i must confess i endeavored to divert them as much as i could from choosing that place for the benefit of the company who walk there i told them it was contrary to all precedent to make use of elms or limetrees since the willow had time out of mind been reserved for that use and that a lover who did not hang himself according to form had as good never hang himself at all they answered me very surlily tho very truly too i must own that it was not my business that it was a very hard case people might not hang themselves without asking my leave and as they would not hinder me whenever i was going about such a thing so they took it very ill that i should pretend to hinder them i must confess madam i could say very little in the case and you may believe i had no great mind to enter upon a quarrel with people in their circumstances but i thought the acquainting you with it was a duty that became  yours etc  letter xii to a lady who asked him for his heart tho to tell a man that you will dispose of his heart to one who shall use it ill is but a very small encouragement for him to part with it yet since you say you have a particular fancy for mine i cannot refuse you such a trifle as that upon whatever terms you demand it i have enclosed it therefore in this letter and trusted it to the pennypost lest your generosity should have made you give a messenger more for the bringing it than the thing it self is really worth i wish madam it were better for your sake and can assure you that were it the most modish one in the world it should be at your service as it is madam i am afraid you will think it very oldfashioned and too much given to those antiquated qualities constancy and fidelity it is probable the lady for whom you intend it may despise those things and think a heart of that sort as ridiculous as a lover in a short cloak slash sleeves pinckd doublet and trunk hose but let her not be prejudiced against things for their first appearances i have seen a very awkard beginner come to dance very well at last and it is not impossible but by good management the heart may be brought quite off those disagreeable qualities you may please to tell her that it having been bred up very tenderly till now it would be convenient to treat it a little kindlier than ordinary at first lest it should be apt to run away she should encourage his sighs now and then with a kind of whisper and when she sees the fire grow a little faint let her give but one or two kind looks and it will blaze out afresh having been troubled with an extraordinary fever since it was in the presence of a certain lady it ought not to be exposed to the open air for fear of catching cold she may conveniently enough confine it to her bedchamber where it may be of great use rightly managed and wake her in a morning with half a dozen deepfetchd sighs better than any larumclock you see madam what confidence i have in your conduct since i trust you to dispose of a heart for me that i have never been able to dispose of my self you will think perhaps it is but making a virtue of necessity and surrendering up a fort which i am not able to hold out against you however madam the fiercest conquerors are kind to garrisons that yield upon the first summons and as i know your power to be greater than any of theirs so i doubt not but your virtues are answerable to them all the favor i shall beg for my heart is that it may be treated as a prisoner of war and that i may have the liberty of keeping a correspondence with it during its confinement to show you i intend nothing but what is fair i am satisfied you should read all the letters i write and that none should come to me but by your approbation and indeed you need not fear this making any escape for if i can guess at all at his humor he will prefer such a captivity to all the liberty in the world and will not be so proud of the titles of prince or conqueror as that of your prisoner and slave  letter xiii to the same if streaming blood my fatal letter stain imagine ever you read the writer slain one hand the sword and one the pen employs and in my lap the ready paper lies ovids epist i have been these six hours in debate whether i should stab my self or write to you first at last madam i have determined on the latter for i consider that if you should hear a fellow mounted upon a cricket singing some doleful ballad of my death you would be at a loss to know the cause of so sad an accident and in an age so inquisitive as ours would take it much better to have a relation of the thing from the first hand than to be put to the trouble of stopping to enquire of it in the street or trusting it to the fidelity of a grubstreet historian the business then in short madam is this coming home about twelve a clock at night i found a letter to tell me that i should meet you in  at five a clock in the afternoon now madam i am really so sensible of my guilt of disappointing you in this manner that after having arraigned judged and condemned my self for it i am just now upon the point of execution i must confess some people have advised me to the contrary and tell me you cannot take it ill that i did not meet you when you know how late it was before i received the letter but i told them that after having written to you i ought never to have stirred from home but staid in expectation of an answer for though it was urged in my defense that i had some great business which called me out and that i had little hopes you should have granted me the honor of meeting you so soon yet this excuse does not satisfy me in the least for why a devil should a man pretend to make love when he has great business and little hope this consideration has absolutely determined me for a sudden execution and whatever you may think upon the first sight of this letter yet before you can have read it out you may assure your self i shall be no more  yours etc postscript i have a thing just now come into my head that may possibly make me defer my execution till i hear farther from you different people having different tastes and there being as many ways of killing lovers as there are of dressing eggs it would anger me very much if i should stab my self for your sake when you would rather have me hanged or drowned    letter xiv to the same it is well madam you prepared me for a disappointment in your letter otherwise i confess i am very impatient under those circumstances i hope it was not in revenge for my missing the other assignation if it be i reckon we are upon the square now you will certainly grant you have all the reason in the world to make me amends for this and it is with a great deal of impatience i expect a more favorable opportunity in recompense you shall dispose of me in whatever manner you please and i am sure you must allow that if i am not the most passionate lover in the world i am at least the most convenient for whenever you have a mind to give sir  or mr  opportunities of saying soft things you shall see that i will manage the other party to your advantage as naturally as can be then madam if after this you have any occasion to make them jealous again there is no man in the world fitter for such an employment than my self you may make use of me madam in any of these capacities but still make use of me and you will not only oblige your self but  yours etc  letter xv to the same certainly the lady who accused me of indifference last night has the least reason in the word to do so is it indifference to be always following her up and down is it indifference to shun all company for hers is it indifference to gaze upon her with all the tenderness in nature these are but the outward signs but o could she look within and accuse of indifference a heart that burns with the most violent passion that ever was it is true madam the rest of the world may with justice enough tax me with it for as there is but one person living who can make me otherwise prudence obliges me to manage things so as to disguise my passion from all the world beside and is there no return due to this but a resolution to deceive me well madam it is some comfort to me however that if you can but for one half hour delude me into an opinion that i am beloved by you that short cheat will be a greater satisfaction than all womankind can grant me beside  letter xvi to the same i see i am destined to destruction why o heaven did i ever see her or since i did why did any body else had i never i could never have been happy and by having seen you i am the most miserable wretch breathing these will appear mysteries perhaps to you and if you think me distracted when i write this you will think right love rage jealousy and despair are tearing my soul in pieces if you have any compassion for a man whom you have rendered the most miserable in the world give me an opportunity of meeting you to day though it be but for one half hour i would not have you come to the walks ie graysinn walks after this rain for fear you should catch cold and a meeting at shops or indiahouses may make people suspicious though i die if i see you not yet i would rather do so than bring your health or reputation in any danger think o think upon some way of satisfying my request and do not apprehend that this distraction which i show you should appear to any body else to your prejudice i wish every one was as careful of you as i am yet i lie i do not wish it for to be so they must love you at the same rate and i had rather allow them all the favors you can grant than that adieu  i am  alas i know not what i am but that  i am miserable and that  i am  yours  letter xvii to the same i think i have taken all the ways imaginable to convince you that i love you above the world however madam you shall see i will do more which is never to see you again it is true mrs  told me i might come to you to day but she told me at the same time that you thought it improper for me to come so often had you any kindness for me you could not have have refused my visits upon so cold a reason as their being improper and if you have not you cannot be pleased that i make them at all you shall see therefore madam how much i value your quiet above my own since i engage my word to you and i am sure madam neither you nor any woman in the world can say i have ever broken my word with them that i will never make you another visit or come into any place where you are except you give me very good assurance that my company will be more acceptable to you than i have reason to believe it has been of late  letter xviii to the same that this parting has not been sought of my side heaven can be my witness and how little satisfaction i take in it every vein in my heart can testify no i tremble i am all confusion and i die when i think upon it and it is only in complaisance to you that i have resolved it i see you are picking little occasions of quarrelling with me i see you are uneasy when i am with you and i see you do not make a return that is suitable to a passion so violent and so sincere as mine is heavens madam what would you have me do should i come to put you out of humor or would you have me appear as a spectacle of your rigor to your morefavoured servants no madam i have too much tenderness for you to give you any disturbance and give me leave to say i have not so mean a spirit as to follow any woman when i have reason to believe she thinks me troublesome how difficult soever it may be to quit her  since you command it i shall not fail of waiting upon once more before we part for ever  letter xix to a friend written from the country the dialogues of plato with your last letter have quite turned my head what delicacy of invention what sublimity of thought i talk no more of women of gallantry i think of nothing but philosophy and seraphiclove o vanity of pomp of glory of trifles falsely called pleasures they appear beautiful to the sight but once tasted they leave nothing but shame sorrow and repentance let us give others leave to play the fool while we enjoy the sweetness of philosophy o charming quiet o dear repose o life truly celestial mounted upon the lofty tops of philosophy we regard at our ease the vanity the folly the madness of the world the greatest cities appear nothing but great herds of madmen so many men so many follies suave mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis e terra magnum alterius spectare laborem sed nil dulcius est been quam munita tenere edita doctrina sapientum templa serena dispicere unde queas alios passimque videre errare atque vias palantes quaerere vitae lucretius  the soul of man according to plato has two wings the one celestial with which she flies up to the empyreal heaven the other terrestrial which pulls her down to the earth again it is the first of these that raises you to those lofty divine paths reached by none but the greatest wits the noblest souls the other brings men down to the things of this world to vanity to sin to marriage poor husbands you have truly observed how soon beauty flies away but alas love flies away much sooner uncomplaisant companion that he is who tho he comes with beauty will not stay with it great politicians without doubt these husbands who suffer an eternal slavery for a thing of so little duration but what signifies that to us let us leave them in peace if there be any such thing as peace in marriage and love me as i love you  letter xx to the same written from london it is so long since i wrote to you that i am almost ashamed of doing it now but to say the truth i have too just an excuse for my neglect being relapsed into a former malady and notwithstanding all the assistance of philosophy fallen in love ten times more than ever i am ashamed to tell you how long i have been so but i am ten times more ashamed to tell you i do not yet find the least decay in my passion tho i have reason enough to believe the lady did not care if she saw me hanging up at her gate well we may put as good a face upon the matter as we will but first or last i see constancy comes upon us all in the humor i am at present i had a good mind to forswear ever being in love again and yet upon better thoughts i think i had as good try it once more for of three amors i have had in my lifetime as for amourettes those are not worth mentioning i valued the one mistress after i left loving her i loved another after i left valuing her i love and value the third after having lost all hopes of her so that methinks according to the course of my passions i ought to love and value the next after having obtained her however from this time forward upon what follies soever you fall be pleased for my sake to spare those of love being very well satisfied there is not one folly of that kind except marriage which i have not already committed i have been without raillery in love with the beauty of a woman whom i have never seen with the wit of one whom i have never heard speak nor seen any thing that she has written and with the heroicvirtues of a woman without knowing any one action of her life that could make me think she had any considering how very common these qualities are i suppose you will not ask me if i have ever been mistaken i know not what you think in the country but for my part i am of opinion a man must resolve to abandon women or philosophy entirely for they will never agree well together after an absence of five or six months from town i find the ladies still the same that is to say still various those who were in love when i went from hence are in love still but they are in love with other men they are constant to love but inconstant to the lovers and in this point to speak the truth among friends i think here is no great difference between the two sexes the men complain of the womens inconstancy and the women of the mens for my part being unwilling to disoblige either i am very apt to agree with both but cupid will have it so and what can weak mortals do against so potent a god adieu live pleasantly that is philosophically and guard your heart from the pains of love  poems on several occasions elegies the unrewarded lover let the dull merchant curse his angry fate and from the wind and waves his fortune wait let the loud lawyer break his brains and be a slave to wrangling coxcombs for a fee let the rough soldier fight his princes foes and for a livelihood his life expose i wage no war i plead no cause but loves i fear no storms but what celinda moves and what grave censor can my choice despise but here fair charmer here the difference lies the merchant after all his hazards past enjoys the fruit of his long toils at last the soldier high in his kings favor stands and after having long obeyed commands the lawyer to reward his tedious care roars on the bench that babled at the bar while i take pains to meet a fate more hard and reap no fruit no favor no reward the power of verse to his mistress while those bright eyes subdue wherever you will and as you please can either save or kill what youth so bold the conquest to design what wealth so great to purchase hearts like thine none but the muse that privilege can claim and what you give in love return in fame riches and titles with your life must end nay cannot even in life your fame defend verse can give fame can fading beauties save and after death redeem them from the grave embalmed in verse through distant times they come preserved like bees within an amber tomb poets like monarchs on an eastern throne restrained by nothing but their will alone here can cry up and there as boldly blame and as they please give infamy or fame in vain the dido tyrian queen resigns her life for the bright glory of a spotless wife if lying bards may false amors rehearse and blast her name with arbitrary verse while penelope one who all the absence of her lord had her wide courts with pressing lovers stored yet by a poet graced in deathless rimes stands a chaste pattern to succeeding times with pity then the muses friends survey nor think your favors there are thrown away wisely like seed on fruitful soil they are thrown to bring large crops of glory and renown for as the sun that in the marshes breeds nothing but nauseous and unwholesome weeds with the same rays on rich and pregnant earth to pleasant flowers and useful fruits gives birth so favors cast on fools get only shame on poets shed produce eternal fame their generous breasts warm with a genial fire and more than all the muses can inspire to his mistress celia your tricks will now no longer pass and i am no more the fool that once i was i know my happier rival does obtain all the vast bliss for which i sigh in vain him him you love to me you use your art i had your looks another had your heart to me youre sick to me of spies afraid he finds your sickness gone your spies betrayed i sigh beneath your window all the night he in your arms possesses the delight i know you treat me thus false fair i do and o what plagues me worse he knows it too to him my sighs are told my letters shown and all my pains are his diversion grown yet since you could such horrid treasons act i am pleased you choose out him to do the fact his vanity does for my wrongs atone and it is by that i have your falsehood known what shall i do for treated at this rate i must not love and yet i cannot hate i hate the actions but i love the face o were thy virtue more or beauty less i am all confusion and my souls on fire torn by contending reason and desire this bids me love that bids me love give over one counsels best the other pleases more i know i ought to hate you for your fault but o i cannot do the thing i ought can thou mean wretch can thou contented prove with the cold relics of a rivals love why did i see that face to charm my breast or having seen why did i know the rest gods if i have obeyed your just commands if i have deserved some favor from your hands make me that tame that easy fool again and rid me of my knowledge and my pain and you false fair for whom so often i have grieved pity a wretch that begs to be deceived forswear yourself for one who dies for you vow not a word of the whole charge was true but scandals all and forgeries devised by a vain wretch neglected and despised i too will help to forward the deceit and to my power contribute to the cheat and thou bold man who think to rival me for thy presumption i could pardon thee i could forgive thy lying in her arms i could forgive thy rifling all her charms but o i never can forgive the tongue that boasts her favors and proclaims my wrong upon the same occasion what fury does disturb my rest what hell is this within my breast now i abhor and now i love and each an equal torment prove i see celindas cruelty i see she loves all men but me i see her falsehood see her pride i see ten thousand faults beside i see she sticks at naught that is ill yet o ye powers i love her still others on precipices run which blind with love they cannot shun i see my danger see my ruin yet seek yet court my own undoing and each new reason i explore to hate her makes me love her more the petition an imitation of catullus is there a pious pleasure that proceeds from contemplation of our virtuous deeds that all mean sordid actions we despise and scorn to gain a throne by cheats and lies thyrsis thou sure have blessings laid in store from thy just dealing in this cursed amor what honor can in words or deeds be shown which to the fair thou have not said and done on her false heart they all are thrown away she only swears more early to betray ye powers that know the many vows she broke free my just soul from this unequal yoke my love boils up and like a raging flood runs through my veins and taints my vital blood i do not vainly beg she may grow chaste or with an equal passion burn at last the one she cannot practice though she would and i contemn the other though she should nor ask i vengeance on the perjured jilt it is punishment enough to have her guilt i beg but balsam for my bleeding breast cure for my wounds and from my labors rest upon quitting his mistress i know celinda i have borne too long and by forgiving have increased my wrong yet if there be a power in verse to slack thy course in vice or bring fled virtue back i will undertake the task however so hard a generous action is its own reward o were thy virtues equal to thy charms i would fly from crowns to live within those arms but who o who can ever believe thee just when such known falsehoods have destroyed all trust farewell false fair nor shall i longer stay since we must part why should we thus delay your love alone was what my soul could prize and missing that can all the rest despise yet should i not repent my follies past could you take up and grow reserved at last twould please me parted from your fatal charms to see you happy in anothers arms whatever threatnings fury might extort o fear not i should ever do you hurt for tho my former passion is removed i would not injure one i once had loved adieu while thus i waste my time in vain sure there are maids i might entirely gain i will search for such and to the first that is true resign the heart so hardly freed from you epigrams written in a ladys table book with what strange raptures would my soul be blessed were but her book an emblem of her breast as i from that all former marks efface and uncontrolled put new ones in their place so might i chase all others from her heart and my own image in the stead impart but ah how short the bliss would prove if he who seized it next might do the same by me lyce go said old lyce senseless lover go and with soft verses court the fair but know with all thy verses thou can get no more than fools without one verse have had before moved at this upon the bawd i flew but that which most enraged me was twas true to his false mistress thou said that i alone thy heart could move and that for me thou would abandon jove i loved thee then not with a love defiled but as a father loves his only child i know thee now and tho i fiercelier burn thou art become the object of my scorn see what thy falsehood gets i must confess i love thee more but i esteem thee less love and jealousy how much are they deceived who vainly strive by jealous fears to keep our flames alive loves like a torch which if secured from blasts will faintlier burn but then it longer lasts exposed to storms of jealousy and doubt the blaze grows greater but it is sooner out cloe cloe newmarried looks on men no more why then it is plain for what she looked before cornus cornus proclaims aloud his wifes a whore alas good cornus what can we do more were thou no cuckold we might make thee one but being one we cannot make thee none thraso thraso picks quarrels when he is drunk at night when sober in the morning dares not fight thraso to shun those ills that may ensue drink not at night or drink at morning too gripe and shifter rich gripe does all his thoughts and cunning bend to increase that wealth he wants the soul to spend poor shifter does his whole contrivance set to spend that wealth he wants the sense to get how happy would appear to each his fate had gripe his humor or he gripes estate kind fate and fortune blend em if you can and of two wretches make one happy man jealousy i who could more happy who more blessed could live than they whom kind whom amorous passions move what crowns what empires greater joys could give than the soft chains the slavery of love were not the bliss too often crossed by that unhappy vile distrust that gnawing doubt thatanxous fear thatdangrous malady that terrible tormenting rage that madness jealousy ii in vain celinda boasts she has been true in vain she swears she keeps untouched her charms dire jealousy does all my pains renew and represents her in my rivals arms his sighs i hear his looks i view i see her damned advances too i see her smile i see her kiss and o methinks i see her give up all those joys to him she should reserve for me iii ungrateful fair one can thou hear my groans can thou behold these tears that fill my eyes and yet unmoved by all my pains my moans into anothers arms resign my prize if merit could not gain your love my sufferings might your pity move might hinder you from adding thus by jealous frenzies more new pangs to one whom hopelesslove had plagued too much before iv think not false nymph my fury to outstorm i scorn your anger and despise your frown dress up your rage in its most hideous form it will not move my heart when love is flown no tho you from my kindness fly my vengeance you shall satisfy the muse that would have sung your praise shall now aloud proclaim to the malicious spiteful world your infamy and shame v ye gods she weeps behold that falling shower see how her eyes are quite dissolved in tears can she in vain that precious torrent pour o no it bears away my doubts and fears twas pity sure that made it flow for the same pity stop it now for every charming heavenly drop that from those eyes does part is paid with streams of blood that gush from my overflowing heart vi yes i will love i will believe you true and raise my passions up as high as ever nay i will believe you false yet love you too let the least sign of penitence appear i will frame excuses for your fault think you surpised or meanly caught nay in the fury in the height of that abhorred embrace believe you thought believe at least you wished me in the place vii o let me lie whole ages in those arms and on that bosom lull asleep my cares forgive those foolish fears of fancied harms that stab my soul while they but move thy tears and think unless i loved thee still i had not treated thee so ill for these rude pangs of jealousy are much more certain signs of love than all the tender words an amorous fancy coins viii torment me with this horrid rage no more o smile and grant one reconciling kiss ye gods she is kind i am ecstasy all over my souls too narrow to contain the bliss thou pleasing torture of my breast sure thou were framed to plague my rest since both the ill and good you do alike my peace destroy that kills me with excess of grief this with excess of joy the cure of jealousy i what tortures can there be in hell compared to what fond lovers feel when doting on some fair ones charms they think she yields em to their rivals arms ii as lions though they once were tame yet if sharp wounds their rage inflame lift up their stormy voices roar and tear the keepers they obeyed before iii so fares the lover when his breast by jealous frenzy is possessed forswears the nymph for whom he burns yet strait to her whom he forswears returns iv but when the fair resolves his doubt the love comes in the fear goes out the cloud of jealousys dispelled and the bright sun of innocence revealed v with what strange raptures is he blessed raptures too great to be expressed though hard the torments to endure who would not have the sickness for the cure a sonnet death i what has this bugbear death that is worth our care after a life in pain in sorrow past after deluding hope and dire despair death only gives us quiet at the last ii how strangely are our love and hate misplaced freedom we seek and yet from freedom flee courting those tyrantsins that chain us fast and shunning death that only sets us free iii it is not a foolish fear of future pains why should they fear who keep their souls from stains that makes me dread thy terrors death to see it is not the loss of riches or of fame or the vain toys the vulgar pleasures name it is nothing celia but the losing thee the antidote i when i see the bright nymph who my heart does inthral when i view her soft eyes and her languishing air her merit so great my own merit so small it makes me adore and it makes me despair ii but when i consider that she squanders on fools all those treasures of beauty with which she is stored my fancy it damps and my passion it cools and it makes me despise what before i adored iii thus sometimes i despair and sometimes i despise i love and i hate but i never esteem the passion grows up when i view her bright eyes which my rivals destroy when i look upon them iv how wisely does nature things so different unite in such odd compositions our safety is found as the blood of the scorpion is a cure for the bite so her folly makes whole whom her beauty does wound upon a favor offered celia too late you would repent the offering all your store is now but like a pardon sent to one that is dead before while at the first you cruel proved and grant the bliss too late you hindered me of one i loved to give me one i hate i thought you innocent as fair when first my court i made but when your falsehoods plain appear my love no longer stayed your bounty of those favors shown whose worth your first deface is melting valued medals down and giving us the brass o since the thing we begs a toy that is prized by love alone why cannot women grant the joy before our love is gone the reconcilement be gone ye sighs be gone ye tears be gone ye jealousies and fears celinda swears she never loved celinda swears none ever moved her heart but i if this be true shall i keep company with you what though a senseless rival swore she said as much to him before what though i saw him in her bed i will trust not what i saw but what she said curse on the prudent and the wise who never believe such pleasing lies i grant she only does deceive i grant it is folly to believe but by this folly i vast pleasures gain while you with all your wisdom live

an ill may come yet i will allow her change when she can see a man deserves her more than me as much as i deserve her more than he  friend did they with our own eyes see our desert no woman ever could from her lover part but o they see not with their own all things to them are through false optics shown love at the first does all your charms increase when the tubes turned hate represents them less  lover whatever may come i will not grieve for dangers that i cannot believe she will never cease loving me or if she do it is ten to one i cease to love her too  the fair mourner in what sad pomp the mournful charmer lies does she lament the victim of her eyes or would she hearts with soft compassion move to make them take the deeper stamp of love what youth so wise so wary to escape when rigor comes dressed up in pitys shape let not in vain those precious tears be shed pity the dying fair one not the dead while you unjustly of the fates complain i grieve as much for you as much in vain each

others whom avaricious thoughts bewitch consume their time to multiply their gains and fancying wretched all who are not rich neglect the end of life to get the means v others the name of pleasure

pleasures move who view with scorn the trophies of the great yet must my self be made a slave to love vii if this dire passion never will be gone if beauty always must my heart inthral o rather let me be confined to one than madly thus be made a prey to all viii one who has early known the pomps of state for things unknown it is ignorance to condemn and after having viewed the gaudy bait can boldly say the trifle i contemn ix in her blessed arms contented could i live contented could i die but o my mind i feed with fancies and my thoughts deceive with hope of things impossible to find x in women

my heart when free you had perhaps prevailed now if you blame o blame not me but fate that never brought you till twas grown too late  damon had the fates brought me then too charming fair i could not hope and now i must despair ruled by your friends you quit the lovers flame for flocks for pastures for an empty name yet though the blessed possession fate denies o let me gaze for ever on those eyes so just so true so innocents my flame that phaon did he see it could not blame  daphne such generous ends i know you still pursue what i can do be sure i wish for you if on esteem or pity you can live or hopes of more if i had more to give those you may have but cannot have my heart and since we now perhaps for ever part such noble thoughts through all your life express may make the value more the pity less  damon can you then go can you for ever part ye gods what shivering pains surround my heart and have one thought to make your pity less ah daphne could i half my pangs express you could not think though hard as rocks you were your pity ever could too great appear i never shall be one moment free from pain till i behold those charming eyes again when gay diversions do your thoughts employ i would not come to interrupt the joy but when from them you some spare moment find think then o think on whom you leave behind think with what heart i shall behold the green where i so often those charming eyes have seen think with what grief i walk the groves alone when you the glory of them all are gone yet o that little time you have to stay let me still speak and gaze my soul away but see my passion that small aid denies grief stops my tongue and tears overflow my eyes  ii galatea thyrsis the gayest one of all the swains who fed their flocks upon the arcadian plains while loves mad passion quite devoured his heart and the coy nymph that caused neglects his smart strives in low numbers such as shepherds use if not to move her breast his own tamuse you chloris who with scorn refuse to see the mighty wounds that you have made on me yet cannot sure with equal pride disdain to hear an humble hind of his complain now while the flocks and herds to shades retire while the fierce sun sets all the world on fire through burning fields through rugged brakes i rove and to the hills and woods declare my love how smalls the heat how easy is the pain i feel without to that i feel within yet scornful galatea will not hear but from my songs and pipe still turns her ear not so the sage corisca nor the fair climena nor rich aegons only care from them my songs a just compassion drew and they shall have them since contemned by you why name i them when even chaste cynthia stays and pan himself to listen to my lays pan whose sweet pipe has been admired so long has not disdained sometimes to hear my song yet galatea scorns whatever i say and galateas wiser sure than they relentless nymph can nothing move your mind must you be deaf because you are unkind though you dislike the subject of my lays yet sure the sweetness of my voice might please it is not thus that you dull mopsus use his songs divert you though you mine refuse yet i could tell you fair one if i would and since you treat me thus methinks i should what the wise lycon said when in yon plain he saw him court in hope and me in vain forbear fond youth to chase a heedless fair nor think with welltuned verse to please her ear seek out some other nymph nor ever repine that one who likes his songs should fly from thine ah lycon ah your rage false danger forms it is not his songs but it is his fortune charms yet scornful maid in time you will find those toys can yield no real no substantial joys in vain his wealth his titles gain esteem if for all that you are ashamed of him ah galatea would thou turn those eyes would thou but once vouchsafe to hear my cries in such soft notes i would my pains impart as could not fail to move thy rocky heart with such sweet songs i would thy fame make known as pan himself might not disdain to own o could thou fair one but contented be to tend the sheep and chase the hares with me to have thy praises echoed through the groves and pass thy days with one who truly loves nor let those gaudy toys thy heart surprise which the fools envy and the sage despise but galatea scorns my humble flame and neither asks my fortune nor my name of the best cheese my wellstord dairys full and my soft sheep produce the finest wool the richest wines of greece my vineyards yield and smiling crops of grain adorn my field ah foolish youth in vain thou boastst thy store have what thou will if mopsus still has more see whilst thou singst behold her haughty pride with what disdain she turns her head aside o why would nature to our ruin place a tygers heart with such an angels face cease shepherd cease at last thy fruitless moan nor hope to gain a heart already gone while rocks and caves thy tuneful notes resound see how thy corn lies withered on the ground the hungry wolves devour thy fattend lambs and bleating for the young makes lean the dams take shepherd take thy hook thy flocks pursue and when one nymph proves cruel find a new iii damon

mopsus weds nisa o wellsuited pair when he succeeds what lover can despair after this match let mares and griffins breed and hounds with hares in friendly concert feed go mopsus go provide the bridal

reached you fruit your mother too was there scarce had you seen the thirteenth spring appear yet beautys buds were opening in your face i gazed and blushes did your charms increase it is love thought

some craggy mountain brought thee forth nor is it human blood that fills thy veins begin my muse begin the arcadian strains relentless love to bold medaea showed to stain her hands in her own childrens blood was she more cruel or more wicked he a wicked counselor he was a cruel mother she begin my muse begin the arcadian strains now let the screech owls vie with warbling swans upon hard oaks let blushing peaches grow and from the brambles liquid amber flow the harmless wolves the ravenous sheep shall shun and valiant deer at fearful greyhounds run let the sea rise and overflow the plains begin my muse begin the arcadian strains adieu ye flocks no more shall i pursue adieu ye groves a long a long adieu and you coy nymph who all my vows disdain take this last present from a dying swain since you dislike whatever in life i said you may be pleased perhaps to hear i am dead this leap shall put an end to all my pains now cease my muse now cease the arcadian strains thus damon sung while on the cliff he stood then headlong plunged into the raging flood all with united grief the loss bemoan except the authress of his fate alone who hears it with an unrelenting breast ah cruel

celebrated by mr pope who has consecrated his fourthpastoral to her memory  ye gentle swains who pass your days and nights in loves sincere and innocent delights ye tender virgins who with pride display your beautys splendour and extend your sway lament with me with me your sorrows join and mingle your united tears with mine delia the queen of love let all deplore delia the queen of beauty

neighboring rivers tell the distant sea and winds from pole to pole the news convey delia the queen of love let all deplore delia the queen of beauty now no more it is done and all obey the mournful muse see hills and plains and winds have heard the news the foaming sea oerwhelms the frightened shore the valleys tremble and the mountains roar see lofty oaks from firm foundations torn and stately towers in heaps of ruin mourn the gentle thames that rarely passion knows swells with this sorrow and her banks overflows what shrieks are heard what groans what dying cries even natures self in dire convulsions lies delia the queen of love they all deplore delia the queen of beauty now no more o why did i survive the fatal day that snatched the joys of all my life away why was not i beneath some ruin lost sunk in the seas or shipwrecked on the coast why did the fates spare this devoted head why did i live to hear that thou were dead by thee my griefs were calmed my torments eased nor knew i pleasure but as thou were pleased where shall i wander now distressed alone what use have i of life now thou art gone i have no use alas but to deplore delia the pride of beauty now no more what living nymph is blessed with equal grace all may dispute but who can fill thy place what lover in his mistress hopes to find a form so lovely with so bright a mind doris may boast a face divinely fair but wants thy shape thy motions and thy air lucinda has thy shape but not those eyes that while they did the admiring world surprise disclosed the secret luster of thy mind and seemed each lovers inmost thoughts to find others whose beauty yielding swains confess by indiscretion make their conquest less and want thy conduct and obliging wit to fix those slaves who to their chains submit as some rich tyrant hoards an useless store that would well placed enrich a thousand more so did thou keep a crowd of charms retired would make a thousand other nymphs admired gay modest artless beautiful and young slow to resolve in resolution strong to all obliging yet reserved to all none could himself the favored lover call that which alone could make his hopes endure was that he saw no other swain secure whither ah whither are those graces fled down to the dark the melancholy shade now shepherds now lament and now deplore delia is dead and beauty is no more for thee each tuneful swain prepared his lays his fame exalting while he sung thy praise thyrsis in gay and easy measures strove to charm thy ears and tune thy soul to love menalcas in his numbers more sublime extolled thy virtues in immortal rhyme glycon whose satire kept the world in awe softened his strain when first thy charms he saw confessed the goddess who newformd his mind proclaimed thy beauties and forgot mankind cease shepherds cease the charms you sung are fled the glory of our blasted isle is dead now join your griefs with mine and now deplore delia the pride of beauty now no more behold where now she lies deprived of breath charming though pale and beautiful in death a troop of weeping virgins by her side with all the pomp of woe and sorrows pride o early lost o fitter to be led in cheerful splendour to the bridalbed than thus conducted to the untimely tomb a spotless virgin in her beautys bloom whatever hopes superior merit gave let me at least embrace thee in the grave on thy cold lips imprint a dying kiss o that thy coyness could refuse me this such melting tears upon thy limbs i will pour shall thaw their numbness and thy warmth restore claspt to my glowing breast thou may revive i will breathe such tender sighs shall make thee live or if severer fates that aid deny if thou can not revive yet i may die in one cold grave together may be laid the truest lover and the loveliest maid then shall i cease to grieve and not before then shall i cease fair delia to deplore but see those dreadful objects disappear the sun shines out and all the heavens are clear the warring winds are hushed the sea serene and nature softened shifts her angry scene what means this sudden change methinks i hear melodious music from the heavenly sphere listen ye shepherds and devour the sound listen the saint the lovely saint is crowned while we mistaken in our joy and grief bewail her fate who wants not our relief from the pleased orbs she views us here below and with kind pity wonders at our woe ah charming saint since thou art blessed above indulge thy lovers and forgive their love forgive their tears who pressed with grief and care feel not thy joys but feel their own despair finis
