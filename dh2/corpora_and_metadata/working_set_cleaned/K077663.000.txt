the elements of beauty  the elements of beauty  also reflections on the harmony of sensibility and reason  by j donaldson  edinburgh printed for charles elliot and t cadell london mdcclxxx  introduction the common error of most of our modern writers on beauty has been that they have supposed all things in order to appear completely beautiful subject to one fixed principle relative only to sense such as shape or proportion books have been written in support of uniformity and variety terms comprehending the nature of all things rather than containing a description alone of what is beautiful others to persuade us in favor of softness and smoothness and of a serpentine line of beauty propriety has also been assigned as the cause of beauty but since there are many things which strike us as beautiful before we discern their usefulness propriety can at best be admitted a concomitant not an efficient cause of beauty concerning matters of taste we appeal to the feelings of the heart rather than to the abilities of the head taste prevents judgment and is more beholden to sentiment than to experience there is however a perfect agreement between right reason and true taste they are reciprocal tests of each others validity since we are not satisfied that such things please but are apt to inquire into the causes and effects of this pleasure before we allow its authenticity this has led many to believe that beauty depends on propriety or fitness though it must be confessed a toad is as fit for the purposes of its nature as a turtledove and we may remark of artificial ornaments that they are mostly of little or no utility neither is beauty itself the same with goodness but rather what is pleasing to sense associated with an expression of goodness to define beauty by softness and smoothness and the doctrine of mere lines is reducing it to the notion of simple sensation but surely one may see and hear without the perceptions of beauty and harmony peculiar to delicacy of sentiment for whatever beauty we may perceive in the subordinate objects of sense it must be confessed it is an expression of the finer passions to which we owe the highest pleasures of beauty and as it is the social or communicative principle which raises our enjoyments so far above the pleasures of other creatures so it is the visible signs appropriated by nature to this principle which render the human body superiorly beautiful  the contents sect i of the general subject sect ii of light sect iii of sound sect iv of motion sect v of assimilation sect vi of contrast sect vii of personification sect viii of character and expression sect ix of gracefulness the elements of beauty sect i of the general subject qualities of objects so far as they relate to beauty are either such as most clearly excite perception or life in the senses or they are composed of these and somewhat expressive of life or sensibility  as the natural love of life or the consciousness of existence is the foundation of all animalpleasure so the first and simplest of our sensations and of which our primary ideas are chiefly compounded are light sound and motion their opposites darkness silence and rest are consequently expressive of horror on account of their similarity to the privation of sight and of hearing or to the extinction of those perceptions which principally constitute the simple idea of animation  sect ii of light all the powers of sense may be referred to that of feeling all the perceptible qualities of bodies may be resolved into motion sight is the feeling of the eye its perceptions depend on the vibrations of some finer medium which produce the sensation of light the greatest beauty of light as confined to sense seems to be the opposition of its three principal modifications red blue and yellow or their various changes and gentle gradations as they are exhibited in the feathers of a peacock the prism or the rainbow a species of which we also perceive in flowers and to which they are much beholden for their tender effect  colors are beautiful or pleasing as their various contrasts yield a livelier sensation of light and heighten perception the colder tints and those that approach to darkness improving the lighter and such as are expressive of warmth and of life  so far as the effects of light or darkness apply to the expression of human character we may observe that in the turbulent agitations of the mind the features accumulate a greater degree of shade the countenance assumes a dark and cloudy appearance gloomy livid and black are complexions suitable to horror despair and death  our ideas of light and of heat are originally and closely connected that etherial fire which is the life is also the light of the world the mellow and ambercoloured light such as is sometimes seen in a serene eveningsky while it is most delicious to sight is of all colors most expressive of the wholesome degree of warmth congenial to life or to the kindly and delicious of passion especially when contrasted by its opposite black or deep violet the bluish pale of the human countenance proper to expressions of fear conveys an idea of coldness and is that of chilly winter or of shaded snow an appearance of violent heat is expressive of the violence of passion anger is denoted by a deep and fiery red the thunder is thrown by the red right hand of jove  while his thunders dire with red right hand at his own temples hurled with fear and horror shook the guilty world franciss horace  mellow and gentle tones of color associate with and dispose to the gentle and delicate of internal feeling harsh and sharp ones with rude and disagreeable emotions faint pale and bluish tints are fitted to express fearfulness and a diminution of the powers of life strong and fiery ones to signify passions of a strong and contrary nature the violent of the senses ever associating with and disposing to the violent or disagreeable of internal sensation  this analogy might also be traced in the operations of the other senses smelling tasting and feeling things that are insipid to taste that dull the palate or act on it with violence are ever ungrateful that certain degree of softness and smoothness that gentle resistance by means of which we best perceive will ever be most agreeable to feeling smells also may be ranged under the volatile or lively and the dull beside the sleepcausing quality of the poppy when taken into the stomach the smell is heavy and deleterious all such smells therefore will associate with silence rest darkness and vacuity bitter or sour things that violently astringe the palate things harsh to the touch or that are too strong for smelling affect the hostile or discordant of passion but as ideas of beauty chiefly refer to perceptions of sight and of hearing we shall confine our reflections particularly to those senses  it is remarkable there is a close analogy between the principal signs of life and the simple or primary objects of sense the chief characteristics of life being heat voice and motion so that strictly speaking whatever objects suggest the sensations similar to the qualities we perceive in ourselves are the actual and principal causes of pleasure even in the senses  it is light alone by which the eye enjoys its pleasures of perception it is light again reflected from the eye to which it owes its superior vivacity and expression a gentle yet clear variation of color or form is pleasing to sight as that of sound is to hearing and it is by means of such variations that we communicate our sentiments of pleasure  sect iii of sound we have already observed that sound is one of the first or simple sensations and that an idea of perfect silence is accompanied with horror especially when conjoined with darkness and universal rest as these are analogous to the negation of sense we shall therefore pass to the consideration of symphony or the variations of sound as they are exemplified in musical expression  of sounds the mellow soft and gentle are most pleasing to sense and best adapted to express the gentle of sentiment deep tones associate with deepness of shade and with slowness of motion the loud the sharp and the shrill rank with the other ruder causes of perception  the most refined melody is that which accords with gracefulness of sentiment it is chiefly employed in quieting the turbulent and soothing the gentler emotions the coarser passions are excited by something that deserves the name of noise or discord rather than of music as the violent emotions increase sensibility is diminished as the gentler ones increase sentiment is improved  in common discourse which treats of indifferent subjects and consists mostly of narrative the voice naturally inclines to a settled monotony or at best rises to a sort of recitative as conversation becomes more animated the variations of voice are proportionally increased artificial music is an imitation of these natural variations as they are more or less expressive of passion or of all those tender depressions and rapturous elevations of the soul when the pours herself forth in generous ecstasy those notes and combinations which please the ear being adapted to the pleasing of passion the sad and discordant as in the passions themselves to set off the more melodious and cheerful for our joys are continually mingled with abatement or with sorrow and are best perceived by a certain degree of contrast gravity of sound being an approach to silence as shade to darkness and as slowness of motion is a drawing nearer to rest we cannot judge of any thing but by relation and it is in the changes of things that we perceive them  sect iv of motion circular and changing shapes are semblative of motion as motion is of life the poets to distinguish clear running water from that which is at rest emphatically attribute life to the former and bid the handmaids for the seast prepare the seats to range the fragrant wood to bring and limpid water from the living spring popes hom odyssey an ellipsis or parabola may not improperly be defined a line whose direction is continually changing though the figure be really permanent and it is evidently the eye which changes milton to express the winding shape of the honeysuckle calls it the flaunting honeysuckle thus beauty of figure becomes a kind of substitute for elegance of motion  to the most delicate sentiments there are certain kindred forms sounds and motions which naturally associate with and are best calculated to express such tenderness of sentiment as it is in some sense alike whether the eye or the object moves and it is plain that quick turnings in animals indicate a more sudden exertion of the living power than slow ones it will likewise follow that wherever the eye overtakes lines running abruptly into contrary directions such lines will convey an idea of the sudden changes of passion though it is not they that move but the fight which moves along them since every appearance we have experienced to hold an alliance with life transferring the emotion to the cause we are apt to conceive is inspired with passion thus we say light is cheerful motion is sprightly or sounds are pathetic  bodies apparently massy and opake are understood to be heavy to affect rest and consequently silence the too much is as incomprehensible as the too little and a certain degree of greatness strikes us much in the same manner as vacuity thus the ideas of vast magnitude obscurity gravity and stillness will ever naturally incline to associate  the determination of bodies upwards is accompanied with a sentiment of liberty and sprightliness the rising foliage of the corinthian capital makes the column seem to bear its superstructure not only with ease but with cheerfulness symptoms of elevated passion are the head thrown up the arms raised above the head like those bacchanalian figures we see so often represented in the antique humility and depression of spirit are expressed by motions of a contrary and listless kind or rather by languor and suspension of action  the coarser and more violent passions are to be expressed by rudeness and extravagance of motion abrupt changes of form and of color sudden turnings and contortions are effects of pain or belong to the extravagance of passion an action energetic yet gentle is appropriated to emotions of the highest pleasure  music has also its counterpart in action dancing is the music of motion music and dancing express the same thing only in different ways the art of dancing teaches to regulate the various movements and gestures of the body to the humor of the music both answering to the sentiment by which they are mutually inspired  and in this way even inanimate matter either by being put in motion or so ordered as to invite the eye to move is made to engage the attention and to affect the passions agreeable to the signs of such passions in ourselves whence all our ideas of form originate and whither also they return by reflection  sect v of assimilation though we have no perceptions but what originate from our senses yet still it is life which pleases whether enjoyed by the strong and clear images of sense or whether the impressions of these mingling into sentimental harmony are attended with the more refined pleasures of imagination our ideas by assimilation and contrast improving in strength mutually assisting each other and increasing affection till at length we attain the highest excellence of moral perception  what is generally understood by harmony relates properly to hearing but there is in nature or rather in the human mind a system of universal symphony carried on by means of assimilation and contrast since there is an attractive as well as a repelling power in every thing that concerns our sentiments and sensations  the theory of association may be divided into the agreement of objects or qualities respecting any single sense among various senses of those of sense with characters of expression and among various characters animated or expressive  thus as an instance of the first kind gentleness of form of color and of motion incline to associate  things that accord with respect to different senses are such as excite an equal degree of perception or a like degree of animation every thing that is delicate to touch accompanied with that particular shape coloring and modulation of sound which agree to form an assemblage that is gently engaging the sweet soft notes of the aeolian harp admirably agree with the still softness of moonlight the agreeable of color figure smell and touch are united by nature in flowers which is the reason they are so delicately pleasing  when more of the senses than one are employed at the same time they naturally act in unison and their different powers are to be considered as tending to excite unity of sentiment to set them in opposition therefore would be to destroy the uniformity and energy of their effect  things of different kinds associate by some particular and striking similitude things of like general disposition by some peculiar difference or contrast human characters being included in this last kind associate by their diversity of expression trees shrubs and plants are to be considered as a distinct species of less perfect characters and there is an agreement between a proper assemblage of these and human characters or their particular virtues or passions personified every thing of the clear or animated kind seeming to attract that which is expressive in any degree of a like disposition and to form a whole that by means of its variety or internal contrasts yields the clearest and most perfect object of perception  what pleases any one sense comes as it were recommended to the rest what is beautiful we are disposed to think is good what is good beautiful though here we must properly distinguish between the good and the beautiful between notions of wholesomeness or utility and that which produces an immediate sensation of pleasure respecting the latter we appeal more directly to the innate and original powers of sense for the former to experience which teaches us that what is most beautiful is not ever the best nor that which is less beholden to favor always the most useless or pernicious the perpendicular wall of a house is good because it implies stability but it is not therefore beautiful on the contrary the ornamental part strikes us not as being any otherwise useful than that it immediately pleases the withered leaves of plants frequently exhibit a coloring more agreeable to the eye than when they are fresh and blooming the smoke issuing from the chimney of a country cottage cannot surely be understood to possess any great appearance of beauty but the object pleases because it conveys a lively idea of the snug happiness and warmth of the people within other objects though really good or useful have nothing in them very pleasing to sense neither do they bear any external marks of sensibility and therefore cannot be said to partake of beauty even with regard to the human character we do not find that virtue ever accompanies the fairest form  things that are associated by habit with pleasing objects though in themselves not agreeable become by such habitual association pleasing provided the balance be on the agreeable side but the lineal and speckled beauty of the serpent will not easily command our attention so long as the horror continues with which that animal strikes us  with a lively sentiment lively images of sense will naturally associate with the agreeable of the latter what is agreeable of the former pleasing associations in the mind being no other than images and sentiments so disposed as to heighten internal perception  faroff sounds or distant prospects associate with and bring to remembrance past circumstances and actions because these too are become more subtle in imagination and rendered as it were remote by time  a farewell is more affecting at the end of summer and at sunsetting than at any other time or season tempest and darkness are suitable to acts of horror great jove to swell the horror of the fight over the fierce armies pours pernicious night popes hom il b xvi  the elemental storm in shakespeares lear finely assimilates the storm in the mind of the distressed king why are lovers fond of moonlight but because like soft music it suits the tender melancholy of their souls there is a fine assemblage of languid motion sadness and obscurity in the following description of old laertes in his rural retirement where sole of all his train a matron sage supports with homely steps his drooping age with feeble steps from marshalling his vines returning sad when toilsome day declines popes hom odyss b    thus to human action and incident a counterpart or harmony is carried on by means of proper accessories or scenery  sect vi of contrast without motion light and sound all our perceptions of sight and hearing must be at an end but it is necessary to render sight visible that there be darkness as it is requisite to render sound audible that there be silence and that there be rest to show that there is motion  there is clearly a relation between time and space and it has much the same effect whether a great darkness be opposed to a small light or a longcontinued darkness to a light of short duration every thing seems to suffer an alteration from the changes of time and place that is according to the comparison of successive incidents or by the opposition of present circumstances by which qualities are compared  the precise effect of any object to the eye depends either on its immediate opposition to other objects or on the more remote relation it bears to such as are retained by memory this may be further explained by harmony and melody in music the first being an effect produced by the immediate opposition of different notes whereas in melody we compare the present sounds with the impression of those that are past  colors are properly opposed to colors and lines to lines but we must not attempt to set in opposition the effect of objects which belong to different senses neither is it necessary that there should always be an immediate contrast since the mind retaining former impressions will associate such of them with the present as composes the melody most grateful to itself for we can suppose no absolute and single beauty without supposing a mind totally divested of all other ideas if memory retain perceptions of other objects it is impossible to preclude comparison  counterpoint in music is the accompaniment which contrasts the general effect of the melody as shade supports light in painting not respecting any part singly but sustaining and heightening each particular melody in the relative effect and proportion it bears to the whole  uniformity is the contrast to variety and minuteness the relative measure of magnitude the inflected sharpnesses of visible objects set off to advantage their protuberant roundings the former lead to an idea of nonentity the latter to a notion of plenitude and existence roundness softness and smoothness are pleasing but not by themselves it is the rough and the sharp which give energy to composition a general idea of beauty being consequent to an assemblage of every quality of matter where the predominant signs of materiality and of gentle feeling are still set off by the obscure foil of their respective contraries or privations an idea of light arises as it were out of darkness sound seems to originate from silence and motion from rest even matter itself seems to emerge from the empty abyss of space imagination in all its conjunctions like a skilful musician still proceeding by the rule of contraries  when any object however complete in its own nature enters into composition it then becomes a part of a greater whole respecting which it must appear to hold a like relation as its own parts one to another though even contrast itself must be in a manner contrasted thus small oppositions uniting in effect are formed into wholes which in their collective capacity produce greater and more striking oppositions  sect vii of personification but though the simple ideas of horror be immediately borrowed from the privations of sense it is otherwise when its images are personified in this case violent motion and loud noise succeed to rest and silence animated terror lightens through the gloom of darkness death darkly bounds from line to line loud tumults shake the field now rushing in the furious chief appears gloomy as night and shakes two shining spears a dreadful gleam from his bright armor came and from his eye balls flashed the living flame popes hom il xii    the negative terrors of privation assume the form of positive destruction every thing that assails the senses violently is personified and life clad in the armor of the foe is apparently turned against itself indeed wherever the elements are thrown into violent commotion and uproar it amounts to a kind of personification the metaphorical terms used on such occasions are always taken from ideas of real life the wind roars the sea rages the heavens look angry and the thunder appears to threaten destruction to the universe and these seem to be the chief materials of what may be called the sentimental sublime amounting only to the animation of those very causes which produced the sublime or terrible of the senses thus by the powers of imagination even death itself is animated and personisied  man is an image admiring his own likeness and such is his inclination to admire every thing that has life that what is wanting in nature he frequently supplies from fancy and when disposed to admiration he enlivens every thing that he may still find more occasion to admire  passion or sentiment being originally the effect of external sense cannot be conceived to exist in absence of the material images or impressions of substance since we cannot conceive the passion of love to be any other than a quality belonging to some being or person who loves or is capable of loving neither can we suppose passion to be impassioned or affection itself to be affected in order to extend our powers of affection therefore we materialize and personify the very affections themselves it is impossible otherwise to render the abstract ideas of goodness distinct or engaging  and here we may observe the force of the first images even in the highest moral sense every amiable virtue is arrayed in white or light innocence simplicity truth herself still retaining what was at first grateful to sight every thing that is good every thing that is pleasing borrowing a metaphor from light is called fair bright or beautiful virtue or goodness is the light and the life the evil or immoral is the obscure of human action because that too implies the privation of life or of happiness what is pain but death positive what happiness but life and pleasing sensibility  sect viii of character and expression character is that which distinguishes one object from another whatever most resembles the symptoms of sensibility in ourselves we discern to have the greatest share of expression that particular object is most agreeably distinguished which either affects the senses by exciting the liveliest perceptions or which by means of what is delightful to sense expresses the clearest sense of internal perception  the same power by which the nerves of the human body are internally agitated affects their extremities and induces an alteration in the external form the pleasures of sensation are again reflected outward and again are perceived by the senses communicating a new and social happiness it is not till goodness be thus expressed that it assumes the nature of beauty  all pleasure whether proceeding from simple or complex causes may be distinguished as follows first the pleasure of perceiving the qualities of objects by means of sense by which we know that we exist secondly the social satisfaction of perceiving an expression of this pleasure in others by which we know that they live or exist thirdly the pleasure of perceiving the social or communicative principle and that this is mutually perceived in ourselves including all the former pleasures and to which they are to be considered only as assisting and subservient  some of our perceptions of pleasure proceed from powers original and innate others are derived from experience and custom such as that which renders things disagreeable in themselves pleasing when we are accustomed to find them associated with circumstances and objects that are in themselves agreeable many are the characters already established by nature and even artificial characters derive a kind of propriety from custom which is rightly termed a second nature is it the character of the eye to be lucid and of the cheek to be red a bright eye and a rosy cheek are of their kind the most beautiful each part being beautiful either according to the degree of gentle expression it possesses in itself or as it is habitually associated with parts that are more gently expressive yet we may observe that this very expression depends for its effect on being properly disposed and contrasted otherwise it could not properly be perceived  one constituent of beauty is color another shape or proportion but a variety of gaudy colors would destroy the effect of beautiful form it is necessary therefore in order to produce an agreeable effect that there be a union and subordination in the means of expression and that none of the less essential qualities confound the greater as it is requisite in order to render any more complicated character or composition perfect that there be a chief or principal part which is most striking or expressive the countenance being the most remarkable part of the human body as in the countenance the eye is the principal feature even one part of the same body owes its beauty to the affinity it bears to the rest as the beauty of the whole depends on its opposition to other bodies the neck of a statue were it ever so well shaped would not appear beautiful when separated from the head and shoulders the seeming softness and smoothness of the bosom would cease to please did the head and shoulders seem to be equally soft and smooth complete characters or wholes to render their qualities striking or perceptible must likewise be properly contrasted and it is as necessary that man be distinguished from man as man from other creatures for this cause in the composition of a truly beautiful human character it is required that there be a certain turn or singularity of form and of feature as well as an air or expression on the whole to establish an identity difference and superiority respecting all other characters to render it peculiarly perceptible and engaging  sect ix of gracefulness in speaking of expression we must distinguish between an expression of the benevolent kind and of the irascible or malignant animals of coarser natures are fully as susceptible of anger hatred revenge or any of the hostile passions as men and the basest of the human race are ever most subject to such passions but they know little of pity love esteem or any of the gentler ones the malignant passions disqualify the mind for every pleasing and ingenious sensation anger is the painful or stupifying passion as love is the delicious and enlivening one it would therefore be highly improper to apply the idea of gracefulness to one in a fit of rage or jealousy what pleases most in appearance being evidently an expression of pleasure  he who seeks to know the origin of gracefulness must look for it in his own mind whatever is graceful there must be so in expression it is a quality analogous to the most exquisite tenderness of affection that sweet enthusiasm of action which goes hand in hand with beauty or if we may be allowed the phrase it is the soul of beauty or the emphasis of pleasing expression  in the tenderest and most delightful moments of thought the body is naturally thrown into attitudes which have the power of communicating a like softness to the minds of others it is on account of this pleasing sympathy that we bestow on such actions or expressions the appellation of graceful  much has been said about an appearance of ease peculiar to gracefulness yet perhaps it will be impossible to find an example of any very graceful attitude that conveys not some degree of carefulness or anxiety the sweet reluctant amorous delay the hopes fears and tender solicitudes of love present us with images of the utmost gracefulness even in circumstances that have an appearance of distress beauty often assumes an air of the sublimest grace and dignity there is indeed a certain elevation of mind a happy consciousness of superior virtue requisite to dignify every passion and is essential to grace for there is no grace without dignity grace is the sublimity of beauty the modest pride of virtue the gentle dignity of love an attitude expressive of the pensive and pleasing melancholy a sentiment peculiar to the finest souls is ever most graceful the loveliest of the graces has on her face a cast of sadness mixed with the sweetest joy gracefulness is an expression of pleasure but pleasure is not ease it is something more in truth the mind is far from being most happy when most at ease this being at best a negative kind of happiness in order to be really so it must be employed in some pursuit wherein it is deeply concerned and its affections fondly engaged beset on all sides with danger and fear we embrace with rapture every occasion of hope and become more interested and happy in the pursuit and accomplishment of our wishes as the labor appears more arduous of overtaking them  here we mean not to say that graceful action may not be frequently found without its peculiar energy in the mind we only advance that our prejudices in favor of gracefulness are originally founded on this principle and would thence infer that any appearance of beauty which is consistent with perfect indolence or ease can suggest nothing more than a predisposition to elegance of action a seeming aptitude in the external symptoms of affection it is not till the passions have arrived at maturity and are sweetened by the accession of love that the person assumes a true air of delicate gracefulness if one who has no elegance of soul appear graceful it is by accident as a fool sometimes looks wise in love the soul is feelingly alive to every finer sense and it is the finest expression of life which excites it love personified being perfect beauty  when we meet with a passage in any author that expresses a lively sentiment of compassion joy grief for even the sorrow of sensible persons is frequently accompanied with pleasure there is always presented to us along with it an image of gracefulness it is this delicious enthusiasm which so conspicuously distinguishes the works of raphael and correggio it is this alone which raises above others the writings of the divinc sappho the great charm of poetry is that spirit or muse which inspires every thing with elegance and animation the beautiful and the graceful of sentiment are expressions of the highest degree of life or human feeling  the venus of medicis is generally given as an example of female beauty and indeed is probably the most graceful and perfect of all human productions but this statue is highly imitative of modesty that exquisite grace and ornament of every amiable virtue were an artist to attempt a painting of the like kind how might he still heighten every grace by diffusing a sweet blush over the countenance of his figure a circumstance in which the marble is necessarily defective and this is no doubt what is meant by that fine allegory of venus attired by the graces that every thing which is graceful in outward appearance is only as it were the trappings and ornaments of that heavenly love of the soul by the ancients ascribed to the venus urania or celestial in opposition to what is attributed to the other venus worshipped by them as the earthly and vulgar  thus have we briefly traced the progress of beauty from its beginning in the senses to its second source of perfection in the mind both centring in the consciousness of life or sensibility and as we have before observed that whatever causes suggest the sensations similar to the qualities we perceive in ourselves are the actual and principal pleasures of the senses so it is still more worthy our notice that nothing gives us so much satisfaction as to contemplate the symptoms of pleasure or happiness in those whose merit and beauty entitle them to a share either in our love or estimation  it is at this second period pleasure loses the name of sensual or selfish he who possesses this more extensive animation is consequently interested in the happiness of his fellow creatures as also in the study of every thing that is related to this finer animation and as he perceives beauty in these things he will interest himself in their perfection looking on them as in some measure related to himself and as portions of that universal and social whole of which he considers himself also as a part  hence we may conclude that the relish mankind have for true beauty is in proportion to the clearness of their moral perceptions or in other words to their love of goodness that even inanimate beauty is chiefly a secondary idea or association arising from the external symptoms of natural affection which is the beauty of the human soul and that not only whatever tends to deprive us of life but whatever obstructs the exercise of the finer powers whereon depends the consciousness of life provokes sorrow fear and horror whatever has the contrary effect promotes hope love and joy  reflections on the harmony of sensibility and reason  introduction the pleasures attending virtue are first the immediate satisfaction we enjoy in contributing to the happiness of others virtue in this case being its own best reward not that it bestows because it receives but that it receives because it bestows as a luminous body is yet more enlightened by the reflection of its own splendour secondly the pleasure we receive from the approbation of the world or rather of that part of it whose applause we esteem the pleasure proceeding from what is commonly called the love of fame  selfishness is that contracted sense of pleasure which excludes every idea of social enjoyment it is a mere abuse of words to call that selfishness which includes the happiness of others since in the strict idea of a self there is but one included  true happiness flows from the firstmentioned principle and is the enjoyment of pleasure by reflection the pleasure of pleasing those we love or the still more extensive pleasure of contributing to the happiness of all mankind the first and second of those motives are indeed assisting to each other for what can be more pleasing than selfapplause when confirmed by the approbation of the good but those who are actuated merely by the love of fame are far more numerous than those who first consult the approbation of their own hearts and who esteem the applause of the many not altogether for its own sake but as it accords with the voice of reason while he whose feelings teach him to distinguish between the good and the evil of moral action will also have a choice in the rectitude of external applause always preferring the commendation of the few who bestow it on real merit to the voice of the vulgar which is determined by caprice or by accident  but what shall we say to such as place their ultimate contentment in selfishness and sensuality whose sympathy is so narrowly confined that they enjoy no pleasure from participation or to those that are so far depraved as to be deterred from actions hurtful to themselves and to their fellow creatures by no other than the basest of all motives the dread of punishment were it possible to persuade mankind what is their chief interest here to know that to assist the good endeavors and to sympathize with the weaknesses and necessities of each other yields an enjoyment far superior to any that is of a mere selfish nature there would be little occasion in a moral view to threaten the infliction either of temporal or eternal punishment indeed it seems almost sufficiently just if there be any totally destitute of humanity that such from their dullness are deprived of the most elegant and exalted felicity  selfsatisfaction it must be confessed is an object of pursuit in all but ambition and avarice embrace the shadow for the substance the means of good for good itself the vainlyambitious place their chief happiness in fame ignorant of what should go before the avaricious in fortune equally blind to the blessings that should follow to employ every gentle method therefore of extending this principle of human sympathy to improve our most delicate feelings and give to the soul a more tender touch of all that is endearing to humanity by exercising it in the speculation and practice of ingenious virtue is the great purpose of moral precept and of sound philosophy  the contents sect i of sensibility

union composes a mind truly noble the folly of illdirected goodness too nearly resembles vice the wisdom of the unfeeling is worse than folly  the same principle which prompts a man to seek happiness or to relieve himself in distress disposes him to make others happy or to alleviate their distresses the less sensibility any man possesses his affections are the more selfish the more he is sensible of happiness himself he is the more disposed to make others happy  that peevish weakness and soreness of nerve which is apt to be alarmed at trifles and to be displeased without sufficient cause is to be classed with other distempers it is false or diseased feeling some are rather irritable than sensible their coarser natures are capable only of the malevolent and grosser passions  a predisposition to the coarser passions can never proceed from delicacy of sentiment but argues a condition the very reverse true sensibility is ever inclined to overlook errors and to forgive injuries although on some occasions reason teaches it to act with becoming dignity and spirit mens enjoyments or misfortunes are to be computed from their different degrees of feeling what can they mean who speak of the happiness of the insensible can there be a greater absurdity than to envy the enjoyments of such as want the power to enjoy  sect ii taste and genius an original delicacy of taste is also the inseparable effect and symptom of the true sensibility which includes not only a sense of love pity gratitude or common duty for of those even the rudest natures are seldom altogether destitute but it is a certain elegance of soul which renders kindness most kind and pleasure most pleasing it is genius and taste the tenderness of friendship the politeness of esteem and the exquisite and refined endearments of love  taste is the younger sister of virtue the offspring of taste is pleasure that of virtue is happiness it is the grace of sentiment that which pleases such as are susceptible of the highest pleasure a subordinate yet more amiable quality which depends on the nicer discernments of sensibility  on the clearness of moral perception or sentimental light depends the power of choosing the good and refusing the evil whatever is properly said to improve the mind increases this faculty of accepting and refusing by rendering the characters of good and evil more perspicuous and distinct  all ignorance of beauty or depravity of taste is defective animation all improvement and perfection of these is increased sensibility the powers of the mind as well as of the body being rendered more perfect by a proper exercise of them to question whether an improved taste be an advantage is in some measure to doubt whether it is better to be or not to be to live or not to live one devoid of taste is dead to all the finer feelings  there is acquired as well as natural dullness bad taste or evil prejudice is stupidity acquired to feel is to be alive every thing that heightens sentiment or perception therefore increases animation  genius is the power or capacity of clearly conceiving and properly combining images and sentiments either as they relate to what is commonly called utility or to taste it is the highest effect of sensibility and reason the power of associating ideas harmoniously  poetry painting and music are sciences peculiarly beholden to genius poetry is the language of elevated and refined passion painting is silent poetry music is the accent of passionate expression  genius is also used to denote a particular turn for any study or employment but one may have a turn for a study that requires properly speaking little or no genius  sect iii poetry painting and music a good poem is an effect of the highest effort of human imagination and judgment  mere imitation is beneath the dignity of poetry painting and music an artist should represent objects not always as they are but as they tend to soothe some pleasing disposition of the soul or as they are heightened in imagination when it is predisposed to sentiment and to passion  to be insensible of the musical powers is to be so far ignorant of the language of the finer passions but it is evident one who never felt the refinements of pity or of love cannot conceive how music should express them or dispose to such gentle emotions  music is the means of soothing and exciting the virtuous dispositions of the soul so far as it answers this end it is to be esteemed otherwise it is fit only to tickle the ears of such as have no hearts whose presumption is ever proportioned to their ignorance and want of feeling  in all things the pleasing of sense associates with the pleasing of sentiment and disposes the mind to happiness and benevolence  sect iv love and friendship as two different notes founded at the same time beget harmony a quality which belongs to neither of them apart so desire and esteem mutually improving each other generate love a passion different from either yet superior to both  love in absence of reason and hatred have almost the same ends and wishes those only are capable of true friendship who know what is kind and agreeable on every occasion to do or to say and are sensibly pleased with what is well said and done a fool can never enjoy the pleasures of love he may indeed taste something of the mere animal part but not the infinite endearments that heighten and protract pleasure nor that sweet mixture of love and esteem which increases with enjoyment  they are mistaken who suppose that the most firm friendships subsist between persons of exactly similar qualities and dispositions such similarity is more likely to produce rivalship than friendship there should rather be on the one side a little more judgment and on the other a little more sensibility and the parties should be sensible of each others perfections this observation holds peculiarly respecting the sexes  a delicacy of person and of mind approaching to weakness is becoming in a female less softness and more strength are expected in the male they ought to make up a complete character together rather than two alike perfect and distinct ones the dispositions of one sex being qualified by the peculiar perfections of the other nature by distinguishing the characters of the sexes has removed all rivalship between them which otherwise might have been a hindrance to the union of love and friendship  whatever peculiar difference marks the delicacy of the female character renders the person of a woman most lovely and this propriety holds also respecting her mind it is that tenderness of passion delicacy of taste and retired modesty naturally peculiar to the sex which renders her most amiable in the esteem of a man of feeling  the tenderness of love and friendship affects a narrow circle the more intense the passion it is the more liable to be confined however universal love and particular friendship are noways inconsistent different degrees of esteem are suitable to different degrees of merit and friendship is contracted and confirmed by habit and close acquaintance one may be a wellwisher to all but can have a friendship only for a few a perfect love but for one  an extended principle of benevolence comprehends a friend a family country and all the world and according to the extent of this principle our capacity for happiness is extended  sect v courage and honor we must distinguish manly courage from beastly ferocity it is absurd to suppose that courage can exist where there is no apprehension of danger the mind that is capable of honor cannot be insensible to fear the former overcoming the latter in a noble cause is true bravery  rancour and revenge are too frequently taken for symptoms of a nice sense of honor than which no qualities can be more opposite to a refined sensibility  honor relates to those parts of human conduct not particularly taken notice of by the laws it teaches a man to preserve inviolate the secrets and to support the interest and reputation of a friend to be strictly just where no public law obliges him to justice to fulfill all equitable engagements to hold most sacred all honest trust reposed in him it is a conscious dignity of spirit which teaches to commit nothing that is mean or disgraceful but which excites to generous and noble actions proceeding from a peculiar delicacy of sentiment assisted and tempered by the fortitude of reason  sect vi conscience all right rules of conduct are drawn from the natural affections and from experience the same affection which teaches us to love our fellow creatures reproaches us when we neglect or behave ill to them and this last operation of affection is called remorse or check of conscience but by habit or education an artificial conscience may be created which may either serve to strengthen or to subvert the conscience of nature   thus a stronger remorse will follow a crime committed against natural affection when confirmed by civil policy and habit than could follow from either of these motives alone  nature has established a common and instinctive attachment between parent and child as also among other relations but the strongest of all affections is that which is conceived by those who love and esteem each other on account of their superior endowments  a man may love his children from the same principle that any animal loves its young but if he also perceives that they are virtuous there results from such a conjunction a benevolence not to be expressed this is natural affection as highly confirmed and approved by reason  that an innate sensibility leads to the consciousness of good and evil is certain but it is also certain that this natural sense may be improved by reason or perverted by prejudice and that laws of conscience are frequently derived from custom which rivets the chains of error to overcome evil opinions therefore the mind must get the better of all prejudices or perversions of conscience and establish a consciousness of right on the solid foundation of just sentiment and reason  sect vii sincerity a little judgment with less sensibility makes a man cunning a little more feeling with even less reason would make him sincere  some have no more knowledge of humanity than just serves them to put on an appearance of it to answer their own base and selfish purposes  he who prefers cunning to sincerity is insensible to the disgrace and suspicion which attend craft and deceit and to the social satisfaction which the generous mind finds in honesty and plaindealing  men who know not the pleasures of sincerity and who traffic in deceit barter an image of kindness for a shadow of joy and are deceived more than they deceive  sect viii passion let us suppose an end of passion there must be an end of all moral reasoning passion alone can correct passion thus we forego a present pleasure in hopes that we shall afterward enjoy a greater pleasure or of longer duration or suffer a present pain to escape a greater and this is called an act of the judgment he who gives way to the dictates of present passion without consulting experience listens to a partial evidence and must of course determine wrongfully  some in order to pay a false compliment to sentimental pleasures attempt altogether to depreciate the pleasures of sense with as little justice though with like plausibility have men endeavored to decry the natural passions and affections as inconsistent with human felicity not from our natural desires and passions do we suffer misery for without these what pleasure can we be supposed to enjoy but from false desires or diseased appetites acting without the aid of experience and understanding  he who commits an action which debases him in his own mind besides its other evil consequences lays up a store of future misery which will haunt him as long as the memory of the deed remains  along with the present effects of any action in order to judge of it aright we must put in the balance also its future consequences and consider on one side the satisfaction and honor on the other the evil and disgrace that may attend it  magnanimity exercises itself in contempt of labors and pains in order to avoid greater pains or overtake greater pleasures  sect ix temperance the great rule of sensual pleasures is to use them so as they may not destroy themselves or be divorced from the pleasures of sentiment but rather as they are assisted by and mutually assisting to the more refined and exalted sympathy of rational enjoyment  men ever confine the meaning of the word pleasure to what pleases themselves gluttons imagine that by pleasure is meant gluttony the only true epicures are such as enjoy the pleasures of temperance small pleasures seem great to such as know no greater the virtuous man is he who has sense enough to enjoy the greatest pleasure  superfluity and parade among the vulgarrich pass for elegance and greatness to the man of true taste temperance is luxury and simplicity grandeur  whatever pleasures are immediately derived from the senses persons of fine internal feeling enjoy besides their other pleasures while such as place their chief happiness in the former can have no true taste for the delicious sensations of the soul  they who divide profit and honesty mistake the nature either of the one or the other we must make a difference between appearances and truths the really profitable and the good are the same  false appearances of profit are the greatest enemies to true interest future sorrows present themselves in the disguise of present pleasures and shortsighted folly eagerly embraces the deceit  every species of vice originates either from insensibility from want of judgment or from both no maxim can be more true than that all vice is folly for either by vice we bring misery more immediately on ourselves or we involve others in misery if any one bring evil on himself it is surely folly if his present pleasure be to make others miserable were he to escape every other punishment he must suffer for it by remorse or it is a certain proof he is deprived of that sense or sympathy which is the opposite of dullness in either of which cases it is evident that all vice is folly  sect x wisdom wisdom or virtue is nothing more than the disposition to enjoy and to confer the greatest happiness with the knowledge how to attain and to bestow it  wisdom has ever some benevolent end in her purposes and actions on the contrary folly either mistakes evil for good or when she assumes the nature of vice entertains a malevolent intention  the advantages and defects of nature should be considered as common to society the weak have a claim to the assistance of the strong the strong derive a pleasure from assisting the weak and the wise are so far happy as the welldisposed partake of their wisdom  there is no one virtue that includes not in a general sense all the other virtues wisdom cannot subsist without justice temperance and fortitude for wisdom is the sum of all these it is impossible to be just without temperance or temperate without fortitude and so alternately of the rest  sect xi power power is no good quality by itself it is the power of doing good alone that is desirable to the wise all vice is selfishness and the meanest is that which is most contractedly selfish  great minds can reconcile sublimity to good humor in weak ones it is generally coupled with severity and moroseness  sublime qualities men admire they love the gentler virtues when wisdom would engage a heart she wooes it in a smile what the austere man advises with his tongue his frown forbids  mens ambition of wealth and of power seems to increase in proportion to their inability to enjoy any refined pleasure  no man has a natural right to hold a greater share of power than another unless he possesses a higher degree of merit if his servants are better than himself he but usurps his place every one should fill that department for which he is fitted by nature where he can be happiest himself and where he can best contribute to the happiness of society  the vulgarrich call the poor the vulgar let us learn to call things by their proper names the rude and ungentle are the vulgar whether in fortune they be poor or rich  the truly poor and worthless are those who have not sense to perceive the superiority of internal merit to all foreign or outward accomplishments  sect xii justice and mercy it is not so proper to say that virtue leads to happiness as to affirm that whatever leads to real happiness is virtue the reason why certain actions are forbidden by law is that such actions are found by experience to be attended with evil effects  but because very few indeed are themselves capable of taking such an extended view of things as to enable them to judge of all the good or evil consequences of actions laws are established for the direction of the weak and to restrain the vicious from committing actions that in their effects are evil  the fear of legal punishment presents the only hold that can be taken of those who have no feeling for others by which they are taught at least to feel for themselves  no action is evil altogether because it is contrary to law but certain actions are justly forbidden by law because their effects are experienced to be evil  let us be careful to separate the idea of justice from that of revenge which like other malevolent passions is to be restrained by reason the great end of human justice is public or private security but forbearance and mercy often reclaim when violence and severity would be attended with evil consequences for this cause it is sometimes proper to return good for evil and to mitigate the rigor of laws with mercy  whatever severity justice may be obliged to inflict it is still with a view to greater kindness to restore the criminal himself to a sense of his duty to set an example to others or to rid society of a desperate member are the three rational ends for which punishment or death is inflicted otherwise retribution of evil is malevolence or blind revenge and not justice  there are certain exceptions to general laws wherein justice assumes the name of mercy he who in his conduct observes these exceptions is justly merciful  it is owing to the imperfection of human laws which cannot provide against all accidental circumstances and exceptions that an idea of mercy is opposed to that of justice these virtues however are not really repugnant where mercy is proper it were unjust not to be merciful  there is hardly any such passion among the virtuous as hatred the vicious hate the enemies of vice the good pity the enemies of virtue a generous mind wishes not to find men faultless but is happy in finding occasions of forgiving their errors  the violent and hostile passions are never employed by the wise but for the greater purposes of benevolence  to withhold our power when we can prevent the ruin of a fellowcreature even against his will is to be guilty of his destruction where is the difference in effect whether evils are brought on us by our follies or by fate is a man the less to be pitied who falls for that his weakness was the cause of his falling  who if he saw a child approaching the brink of a precipice would withhold his assistance on a pretense that the child was left to the freedom of its own will men are like children that sometimes must be restrained from the ways of error  thus it has been instanced through the whole of this performance that sensibility as directed by reason constitutes virtue  finis
