dibdins selected songs  a collection of songs selected from the works of mr dibdin  yet still am i enabled to bring up in lifes rear g pen london printed for the author and sold by him at his warehouse no     strand opposite the adelphi  dedication to william davis esquire sir if ever dedication had a legitimate motive this has  the recollection of a friends having witnessed the first dawnings of my poetical and musical ideas  his kind partiality to them  his friendship and liberality in promoting a scheme for my benefit  his handsome conduct in forgetting that at the instigation of unprincipled men i believed him to have been unfaithful to his promises in fine the variety of instances in which he has proved himself such a friend as no man but myself could ever boast of   these not only point out the most perfect propriety in my making an acknowledgment of my obligations but would also mark me as very unworthy of them if i neglected to seize so becoming an opportunity of inviting the public to bear testimony to my high sense of such kindness  you sir are the friend thus described the facts i have spoken of exist and as i slatter myself you will allow that ingratitude makes no part of my disposition it cannot surprise you that i endeavor to do you common justice  so well however do i know you that you will wonder i should conceive it necessary to mention those kindnesses as a favor which you conferred for your own gratification  i beg leave nevertheless to be excused if i put in my claim for a little gratification too for as nothing ever gave me more pleasure than this proper address  the spirit of which i beg leave to assure you is us pure as honor and the letter as sincere as truth  so i know nothing that could have been a severer mortification to me than to have been prevented from the satisfaction of thus telling you how truly  i am your highly obliged friend and very grateful humble servant c dibdin strand april       0 preface so many opinions have been hazarded by cavillers on the subject of the following songs that it would be almost a tacit acquiescence in the folly ignorance and absurdity of such opinions were i to do myself and the public so much injustice as to let this opportunity pass without giving them their merited notice  were i disposed to pleasantry i might say with my irishman that the proper notice would be no notice at all  and indeed were it not for the sake of simple truth and common justice such calumniators might as well pass unregarded for envy is as natural to dunces as hunger and what should they seek to satisfy but the cravings of their appetites  as however there is something seriously material in attending to whatever in the slightest degree regards the public i shall go a little into this business if it be only to show how tiny and ineffectual are the yelpings of these literary curs who like true mongrels never open but to do mischief  it is remarkable that throughout my whole public career i have been nibbled at the heel by these mongrels of the muses these slinking snarlers who the reverse of the dogs that guarded the fane of diana fawn upon vice and cherish every thing but virtue  when i composed the music of the padlock the cry was that i employed some italian for fifty pounds to do that of which i was incapable i smiled with contempt at the rumor and the public very soon did me justice  after this i had the temerity to write for myself the villainy of such an action was unpardonable and it was immediately resolved to brand me with an aspersion as false as it was invidious here i was obliged to assert my claim to a public hearing and the consequence was the town chose to allow that i had as much right as any other person to the privileges of a subject and the feelings of a man  this terrible disappointment to the snarlers awed them into a kind of sulky growl which has never since broke out but very partially and as petulance and soreness generally interpret every thing the wrong way and defeat their own ends so the malignity of their sarcasms have not been more remarkable than their folly they have attributed my sea songs to men who knew no more of nautical terms than an english sailor does of art or hypocrisy they have made more blunders in detecting my irish songs than the songs contain themselves and in the investigation of my hunting songs they have been perpetually at fault  a friend of mine one evening dropped in at a coffeehouse where a number of these literary jurymen were holding an inquest over my murdered reputation  he humoured the jest and before he had finished proved to the satisfaction of every one present that poor jack was a posthumous work of dr johnson that the race horse was written by the jockey who rode the famous flying childers and that blow high blow low was the production of admiral keppel who dictated the words to his secretary as he lay in his cot after the memorable battle of the twentyseventh of july waiting for the french to try their force with him handsomely the next morning  but the mischief of it is these poor devils cannot discern that all they do to injure me gives me real consequence the public are always sure to take up a man at whom the shafts of rancour are levelled  if his efforts be nothing more than inoffensive he is secure of protection in favor of his intentions if meritorious they know too well their own dignity not to rank him according to his deserts  to that public i would make a solemn declaration that i am the sole author of every thing this book contains but that they too well know the hue of truth to need an elucidation of it by any light i can place it in  as however i do not wish to crush this vermin  on the contrary i would have them crawl and nibble for vermin are as necessary in the system of literature as in the system of the creation  i am willing to allow that there are plenty of faults in this work  yet lest such reptiles should extend any fang with pleasure at these delicious tidings i must insist that i could very often have written better had it not been for musical necessity which in some instances precludes nerve and in others requires it when the reverse would probably have made the poetry read better  all these considerations are very safe with the public at large to whom i never can address myself without confessing more incapacity of expression than is attributed to me by the sourness of my heartburnt enemies  to these poor creatures did i wish their deserts i should be more cruel and injurious than they have it in their power to be to me  dibdins selected songs song in the wedding ring i saw what seemed a harmless child with wings and bow and aspect mild who sobbd and sighed and pined and begged i would some boon bestow on a poor little boy stone blind not aware of the danger i instant complied when he drew from his quiver a dart cried  my power you shall know then he levelled his bow and
