a brief description of orkney zetland pightlandfirth and caithness wherein ter a short journal of the authors voyage thither these northern places are first more generally described then a particular view is given of the several isles thereto belonging together with an account of what is most rare and remarkable therein with the authors observes thereupon  edinburgh printed by george mosman an dom  mdcci  to his grace james duke of hamilton may it please your grace upon my return from zetland as bound in duty i paid my respects to your gr who was pleased to ask if i had kept a diary which i acknowledged but could not show it till the remarks therein contained were transcribed which when done y gr should have them to glance at some leisure hour thus your command giving rise to this undertaking i have presumed to make the dedication to y gr  the noble and illustrious family of hamilton the first in the nation stands in no need of panegyricks from me to set forth it eminency his gr your father was ver instrumental in settling the peace and q of this kingdom at the late merciful and wonderful revolution as became a patriot of h country under whose presidency in the convention of estates the government  our church was restored which since ha been confirmed by the subsequent parliaments  in his surviving consort your pious mother these endowments and qualification requisite in the consort of a prince have emnently shined forth which will emba her name to succeeding generations he likewise being so very helpful to many afflicted ones both in the former years of thi churches distress and trouble and in the later of great scarcity and dearth she knowing how valuable are the blessings of those who were ready to perish  your gr honorable appearance for and acknowledgment of presbyterian government in the last session of parliament wa acceptable to many and i hope y gr shall never have cause to repent of your continuing to favor the ancient government o this church which as it is conform to the scriptureplan so the lord has been graciously pleased to own and countenance it in the great things he has done for and by the ministers and professors thereof  among these things for which you stand obliged to the wise conduct of providence one is that you have been so well directed in the happy choice of your consorts your present lady of a sweet and gentle temper her carriage obliging and discreet to all her loving to entertain pious and religious discourse her modest and exemplary dress i wish she may prove a blessing to y illustrious family and be as rachel or as leah which two did build up the house of israel  your noble brother lord george has been created by our present gracious king earl of orkney for his heroic appearances under the auspicious conduct of our king as is evident by the narrative of his patent of honor who was pleased to take notice thereof some of these being under his majestys view and in testimony of his royal favor dignify him with this honorable title which in the years of ancient times has blazoned the escutcheons of kings  the branches of y illustrious family do flourish in several parts of the nation tho god in his holy providence has made lately a breach thereupon to y grief and the nations loss  your gr relation to the ancient and honorable family of douglas gives me occasion to mention that old alliance betwixt that house and the princes of orkney william lord of niddesdale commonly called the black douglas by egidia or giles daughter of king rob   had a daughter of the same name married to henry sinclar usually styled knight of the cockle of the garter hist of the house of douglas and angus and prince of orkney to him succeeded his son william sinclar married to elizabeth douglas about the end of the    and beginning of the    cent daughter to archibald earl of douglas sirnamed tineman whose titles were knight of the golden fleece and of the cockle prince of orkney duke of holdenburgh earl of caithness lord sinclar lord of niddisdale great admiral of scotland etc  my l the knowledge of history is that which the most of men are taken with as being both pleasant and useful and it cannot but stain the reputation of any tho able to give account of what is rare in other countries if they be ignorant of their own and places which depend thereupon where things no less remarkable do occur which may both exercise the ingenious and edify the gracious inquirers  but above all blessed are they who make a religious improvement of natural observes and use all arts and sciences as handmaids to religion and piety the knowledge of christ is the queen of sciences hence a learned paul determines to know nothing but christ and him crucified and those who in all ages have been wise unto salvation have preferred christs cross to the worlds crown and with moses reckoned his worst things better then the worlds best the knowledge of all other things without the knowledge of christ is as a shadow without the substance and a body without the head as some have instituted the comparison yea they are  without mind and judgment the cardinal virtues as they are called may be attained in show but not in truth quid enim illis cum virtutibus qui dei virtutem christum ignorant all the glory and grandeur of the world laid in the balance with this piece of saving knowledge is but as a grain weight to counterballance a huge mountain galeaceus caracciolus marquess o vico in the kingdom of naples hence a notable saying of a truly noble lord when set upon by the jesuits to change his religion tempting him with splendid and rich offers let their money says he perish with them who think all the glory of the world worth one days communion with jesus christ and truly it is but small gain the most painful and able student does reap indocti rap unt caelum and nos cu doctrina nostra in gehennam trudimur if after all his labor in the records of antiquity and researches of nature and it may be through the maze of intricate disquisition he lose his soul and notwithstanding of all his learning be thrust into hell being forced to cry out on death bed as it is reportthe learned grotius once did ah vitam perdidi operose nihil agendo  my lord i hope it will not prove unsavory to y gr that i have a little enlarged this epistle in commending of christ and religion which so much transcendeth our commendation and praise whence so many advantages do accrue to us and among others when there are early impressions of piety o any the conscience for ever after uses to hang about them notwithstanding the tenor of their lives has been assaulted with manifold tentations that y gr may still continue to be a true lover of your country and a zealous asserter of her rights and liberties is and shall be the desire of him who is  may it please your gr your gr most humble and most dutiful servant john brand  preface to the reader i shall not insist on an apology why i trouble the sweating press tho i might use and plead the common topics taken from the advice and importunity of others and to prevent the publishing of some of these remarks excerpt from my papers by some into whose hands they had fallen after they had lien by me several months  there are several grave persons in these isles of good and solid judgment both ministers and others who being better acquainted with the places of their ordinary residence then it can be supposed i had occasion to be might have published something more valuable on this head and set their remarks in a clearer light as likewise some of my dear brethren of the commission might have done it to greater advantage yet the engagements that lay on me to transcribe the most remarkable occurrences and the solicitation of some thereupon to publish them have some way obliged me to make this appearance however if others hereby shall be excited to serve the public by giving a fuller and clearer description of these generally little known places this essay will not prove altogether unuseful and if i had known that any intended to have published something of this nature the world had not been troubled with my scribbling  i hope none will judge that i act without my line in giving descriptions of this nature seeing all are called to remember the works of the lord and talk of his doings as they have occasion and all along i endeavor to keep in mind the character i bear dropping something of a spiritual improvement  our historians such as i have consulted have given but a very brief and lame and in some things a false account of these places especially zetland which is unknown to the most of the nation if not that they have only heard there were such isles a the zetlandick it is true there is one mr wallace a late minister in orkney who has gratified the world by giving a description of the orkneyisles but neither zetland no caithness does he meddle with and as to orkney there are several things which deserve their own remark he makes no mention of and others have fallen out since his time which i have noticed so that on the whole the account now given even of orkney will appear almost new to any who shall be pleased to compare the two descriptions together  no doubt but such as know these places will desiderate several things no less remarkable then wha are observed but still my reader would remember that this is but a diary transcribed yet thi may say as i have not willingly suffered my self  be imposed on so neither have i imposed any thing n the credulous world but delivered such things which either i was witness to or had good ground  believe from persons worthy of credit so that  any thing appear questionable i have ordinarily n general given my author for it omne tulit punctum qui micuit utile dulci   i suppose the judicious reader in perusing the ollowing sheets will find things borh curious and nstructive affording matter of meditation to the wise observers of providence  as to any philosophical or philological observes s i am unfit for so am i far from a magisterial ictating of them to any but soberly proposed my wn sentiments which if my reader do not relish e may follow his own  although the style be not quaint and elegant mbellishd with the ornaments of art yet i hope it will be found plain and intelligible and tho sometimes obliged to express my self in the dialect or idiotism of the country yet ordinarily such words and phrases are some way explained so when i speak of orkney or zetland as not in scotland tho depending thereupon i express my self as the country do  as to the commissions work i have not meddled therewith except when the thread of the history did require me to touch it however this i may add our weak endeavors for the advancement of the interest of our lord jesus in these remote corners have not been found by superior judicatories altogether unsuccessful and i suppose it repents none of us of our voyage thither

introduction it is a principle generally ackowledged all men obliged to promote the public good that all men in their several stations according to their capacities are carefully to study the maintaining and promoting of the good and interest of at kingdom nation or society whereof they are members for if it go not well with the public in mmon it cannot reasonably be thought that the hapness of any in particular can long continue more than  can go well with the several members of a natural ody when the body it self is distressed non nobis nati sed patriae and republica cicero dulce and decorum est pro patria mori it was this enerous love and concern for their country that so gnalised the ancient romans and made them in a short me arrive to such a height of glory and honor unto this did their philosophers poets and orators armly excite their fellowcitizens so that the more  the less any laid out themselves this way their ateivements accordingly were reputed noble and heick and their persons renowned  yet much more will we find our selves bound to dvance one anothers good especially christians bound to this if we look on our selves ot only as men and members of the body politic ut as christians and members of that body whereof christ is the head therefore our love of care for   romans         cor        etc and sympathy with one another is much commended n holy scripture which the apostle well illustrateth in several places by that apposite and elegant similitud of the members of a natural body phil     0    their conspiring t the mutual good of one another and expressly commands look not every man on his own things but a on the things of others and the want thereof he do heavily regrate in the same chap for i have no m likeminded who will naturally care for your state for  seek their own not the things which are jesus christ which selfish and narrow spirit as it has too much prevailed in all ages of the christian church since the days of the apostles so in none more then this o ours owen on hebr      as the learned owen observes imputing the shame and the almost ruin of christianity thereunto the lord christ says he has ordained that the members of the same church and society should mutually watch over one another and the whole body over all the members unto their edification and that the practice of it is so much lost as it is i the shame and almost ruin of christianity  gubernatores metaphora a ncleris navem gubernantibus ducta more especially all clothed with authority civil or ecclesiastic but more especially these clothed with authorit civil or ecclesiastic stand obliged to this public care ministers being as pilots or governors under christ to the ship of the church as magistrates under god are to that of the state and the charge of minister having a more immediate respect to the soul and better part of man they are called the more diligently to take heed thereto and so to steer their course through the boisterous sea of this world as that not only the themselves at length may arrive and rest at the fa havens of immanuels land but that also through grace they may carry alongs many with them embaqued on the same bottom of the covenant by the means of word and discipline ministers are stewards watchmen shepherds bishops or overseers etc all which do imply a charge to be discharged by them for the good of others  ministers considered in a   fold relation ministers may be considered in a threefold relation   as christians related to christ which i common to them with all believers   as ministers  related to that particular church or portion of the church in general the inspection whereof is assigned  them and in which more especially and immediately they are called to labor   as they stand related to the church national whereof they are miniers whose good they are to endeavor as god in s holy and wise providence shall afford them access and that in all these respects ministers may the more prove themselves unto their great lord and master cording to his appointment the apostles example d the practice of the church in all ages they do sociate themselves unto councils meetings or assemies more or less general that so by common coun and consent they may consult the interest of the urch of christ within their respective districts and unds which as it has been the laudable practice other churches so of the church of scotland ever ce her first reformation from popery  for which end the general assembly of this national urch moved with zeal for the glory of god assemblies zealous in planting the north of scotland has velled much since the late happy revolution in plang the north of scotland and that they might not be nting in visiting the utmost bounds thereof with the

and it necessary to depute a commission thither onsisting of seven ministers and one ruling elder ith power not only to visit and order the churches there but likewise to concur with and assist the prbyteries of orkney and caithness as there should be occasion  the authors design of this commission the author being one desig a brief description of these remarkable parts after short journal of his voyage thither with some cusory observes thereupon  chap i containing a brief journal of our voyage from leith to orkney and thence to zetland  likewise of our return from zetland by orkne to caithness together with a summary acount of the remarkable dangers we were in we set sail from leith on friday    april   00 about six a clock  the morning we set sail from leith for orney the wind fair tho faint which not being a to bear us up against the tide we dropped anchor t miles east of inchkeith where we lay from ten t three in the afternoon when a briskgale arising  weighed anchor and sailed down the firth the she making so good way that before next morning at bre of day we were past montross  on saturday the wind lessened yet about st set we past peterhead steering toward the point kinnaird leaving the bridges of ratray a ridge of b rocks on our larboard next morning being  lords days with a gentle wind we made the  of our way through murray firth pass murray firth spending the  in religious exercises with the mariners and so passengers in company with us when before pe head we saw the fins of a great fish about an y above the water which they call a pricker also ab ten at night a whale was seen by the help of molight at a little distance from our ship casting for the water in a hideous manner  next morning about seven a clock we got sight  orkney and the wind blowing some what harder en it had done the former night in the afternoon  passed the east end of pightland firth land in orkney which though inarily raging with the impetuous current of a sea  reason of the many tides meeting there yet we and it not so but in the midst of that part we pas dined upon deck so meeting with least danger ere we feared the greatest we put in to holmsnd and arrived there about seven at night on the onday after our setting sail  the ships crew told us the voyage favorable that tho they had freently sailed these seas to and from orkney yet never d they a better or pleasanter voyage which prodential favor was the more observable the wind xt day after we landed blowing strong from the orth and lasting several days which if it had come  before we had accomplished our voyage we ould not only have been blown back to sea but ereby a tempest arising we had been in no small nger we desired to look upon this as a signal mercy d a token for good  we would have hired our bark to zetland but e master being under charterparty we forced to hire an open boat from orkney to zetland was obliged to turn with a fraught of victual to leith and not ving the occasion of any other ship or bark we ere forced to hire one of these open boats of about six meils which the orkney men use for carrying victual  zetland else we could not go for zetland this sean tho the ministers and others told us our passage ight prove dangerous  our stay in kirkwal the chief town in orkney assisting that presbytery in some of their affairs was om the    to the    of april when with   ministers of this country on the commission we took oat for sanda about  0 we go for sanda from kirkwall miles northeast from kirkwal and in our way to zetland having ordered our own boat to follow with the first fair wind we put off about two in the afternoon the men rowing wit six oars about half way when the wind rising something favorable with a little sail and   oars we go over stronza firth tho as we came near our landin place in sanda the increasing wind raised the wave so high that sometimes they intercepted the sight  the island yet we got all safe on shore betwixt  and  0 at night the mercy of our escape was the more remarkable that our boat was thronged wit passengers and so overloaden that the water came almost to her brim so that if the sea had not bee smooth and calm when we past throw stronza firth we had been probably all lost as these who had knowledge of those seas did afterward declare unto us  go from sanda to eda we waited in sanda for a wind from april    till may   when the wind presenting we went t the isle of eda lying a little to the west of sanda where our boat was but before we could get aboard the wind shifted to southeast and then to east an by south which was too scrimp to fetch zetland however the wind now being very changeable we judge it expedient for us to ly near our boat and lay hold o the first occasion so may    the wind at southea we put to sea but scarce well were we without t redhead of eda when the wind proving contrary we returned to calfsound may    being the lords day we spent in religious exercises with the people of the isle in the evening the wind turning fair we resolved next morning early to get aboard if the wind held this last night after we returned to calfsound was terrible for wind and rain from the west the wind soon altering after we had got it again to calfsound with which we could not have kept the sea in all probability a great mercy the it was that we were determined to return and did not keep the sea as some advised for tho within half an hour after we had got in to the sound the wind turned fair yet being too strong the sea became foul ad tempestuous which was not for our open boat  monday morning may    about two of the clock e were called to go aboard which we did according the wind at west or west and by north the ale was brisk but not very great which we were lad of thereby expecting a speedy passage putting off from eda we in great danger so we ith two other boats in company loosed but scarce ere we a league without the heads we saw a storm f wind and rain making in the west whence the wind blew whereupon one of the boatmasters in comany advised us to tack about and endeavor to etch calfsound again which counsel we judging to be afe accordingly essayed to follow it but the wind and sea rising more boisterous and the current of the bb being strong from the sound we could not by any means effectute our design tho we made several trips ot without danger the sea with its broken and sweling waves threatening to swallow us up every moment the mariners stood by their sails crying this work was very dangerous and at one time as one of them observed the boat had taken in about  0 barrels of water the pump was still kept going we udged our selves to be lost men and some expressed o much in these straits we desired the boatmaster itting by the helm to see if he could make any other harbor or bay he answered god have mercy upon s for the sea we dare not keep and there is not another harbor in orkney we can make the men were fatigued with the toil of their hard work and lmost at the giving over we then knew to our experience the meaning of that scripture ps  0    of seamen in a storms being at their wits end tho the wind was fair for zetland yet we durst not hold on our course the sea not only being tempestuous but we had also several rousts or impetuous tides to pass and then the ebb was in the sea which made them so much the more dangerous thus streitened we thought it advisable to go down with some sail before the wind to the north end of sanda and endeavor to get in to otterswick or taphness bay get in to a bay we fir attempted otterswick and lest we should have been blow by the bays mouth we held so near land that the boat beat several times upon a rock however we go in and dropped anchor on the weatherside of the shore  go to sea again we were all much refreshed with this great deliverance from so imminent a danger when we had ridden some hours at anchor the wind and sea calmed about   at night one of the boatmasters in company who had entered the bay a little before us weighed anchor and put to sea again some of our number we for lying still till the weather was better setteld others thought that seeing god had commanded a calm that we had a favorable wind that the sky appeared t be well set and promising and that the other loadened boat had gone to sea before us it might seen from these things providence invited us to sea again whereupon we put off but before we had come the length of north ronalsha scarce a league distant from the bay we had been in the wind became so faint that the mariners took them to their oars to help them through north ronalsha roust thence when w came to dennis roust we made some way with our sail without oars the tide then turning and the flood beginning to run in the sea  blown back by contrary winds to stronza tuesday may    about   or   in the morning the wind shifted to east south east then to east an our boatmaster telling us that he was forced to ste a northern course else he could not bear sail an so holding on not a stone in zetland he could hit a he expressed himself we all judged it most prop to return to orkney when we had tacked about the wind shifted to north east a strong gale together wit great rains which caused a rolling and a swelling se for rains here without winds do raise or canker as they term it the sea and much more when win and rain come on at once however we got in safely to stronza road which was the readiest we could make it was a happy providence that we then returned at that nick of time for the flood not being all spent we were thereby likewise hastened in our way so that within a few hours we came to our port tho as was reckoned we were near midway between orkney and fair isle the storm increased with the day and after our landing it was so very great that we were obliged to keep within doors for several hours and if then we had been at sea it is terrible for us to think upon the dismal effects which might have followed thereupon for without all peradventure we had certainly perished if the lord by some wonder of mercy had not rescued us as indeed he had formerly done o that we would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men and that so long as we live we may never forget the   th and   th days of may wherein the lord wrought a great deliverance for us  thus being discouraged tho discouraged with dangers we yet resolve to go for zetland we were in great perplexity not knowing what to do whether to make any further attempt or to return home re infecta seeing god in his providence had so crossed us hitherto and it might be his mind we should not go forward upon these fluctuating and perplexing thoughts we asked gods mind in the matter after which more light did arise and we unaminously resolved yet to try what the lord would do with us  friday may    between   and   in the morning we arrive at lerwick in zetland wind and sky promising well we put to sea and passed the fair isle about   afternoon keeping it on our starboard then our gale increasing but continuing fair at southwest we made good way about midnight we past swinburgh head the southernmost point of land in zetland having thence    miles to sail up within land to lerwick whether we were bound the wind growing more vehement we lowed our mainsail and took in a riff with the breaking of the day there arose a mist whereby we could scarce see land however we judged it safest to keep as near it as we could and sailed away by the coast but being to pass through a sound having the isle of musa on our starboard and burra land on our larboard a danger escaped our seamen mistook the point of musa taking another point in the mainland for it and the mist lying on we were almost engaged in the land and so would have fallen among rocks which they coming to suspect held to sea resolving to sail without the point which they did with difficulty the boat being so close haled and the blast great that the helmalee was scarce able to command her and keep her by the wind which when they had done came to discover their error hence sailing through musa sound we came to brassa sound and arrived at lerwick on saturday about   in the morning  some remarkable providence by the way we had a quick passage sailing about  00 miles in    or  0 hours time especially considering that we were not half an hour on shore when a strong wind blew from the north which if it had come on but a little soonner we would have been driven back to sea there is likewise another providence remarkable that we had only an ordinary desirable gale when we passed the fair isle where always there goes a great rolling sea but when within the heads of the land of zetland we had it very strong so that scarcely we could have wrestled and held out against it in the ocean  we leave zetland and arrives at kirkwall in orkney we arrived in zetland may    and having brought to some period and close our principal work there we set sail for orkney june    saluting and bidding heartily farewell to the ministers and some gentlemen of the country and to the most considerable inhabitants of lerwick who kindly accompanied us to our boat we left zetland teusday june    about   afternoon and having the wind at northwest or north west and by north we passed the start head of anda about   next morning and endeavoring to et in to ketteltaft in sanda a danger escaped to put one of the miniters of that isle ashore our boat through our boatmasters inadvertency struck on a rock without sustaining any damage we knew but the wind not permitting to turn up to that road we all came to kirkval and arrived there before   in the morning our astage from zetland to orkney was yet quicker then t was from orkney to zetland we being but    hours n running   0 or as some say     miles staying n orkney a few days pass pightland firth to cathness and thence home by land we passed pightland firth to caithess and having dispatched our work in conjunction with the presbytery there we came home by land epairing with joy to our several charges where we may set up our ebenezer saying hitherto has the lord helped us  i think we are called seriously to reflect upon the maner of the lords dealing with us some reflections upon the dangers we had been in we have been long detained and crossed in our way to zetland tho we made several attempts to go forward as to our commission we were appointed by the general assembly of this church and it being put upon us without any desire of ours or inclination that way we accordingly undetrook our voyage and came with a favorable gale to orkney it is true that there are natural causes of wind and rain whereof we are to make a spiritual improvement especially when they do impede or promote our design moreover gods judgments are a great depth and by the course of nature in giving greater or lesser winds at his pleasure he may carry on his more general works of providence and yet thereby more especially intend the punishment of the wicked or the chastisement of his people which they are called to consider and improve and as true it is god in his wise soveraignity may so deal wih his people for the trial of their faith and other graces that they may be still and know that he is god ruling as he pleases among the children of men the devil also who is the prince of the power of the air may have an evil and malicious hand in things of this nature especially when men purpose to do good which tends to the overthrow of his kingdom o that what we have met with may be so blessed as to render us more zealous against him and all sin whereby his kingdom is established in the world that we may fight with devil and be more then conquerours through him who loves us i say tho these things and the like sometimes may and ought to be had a regard unto yet i do humbly judge that upon these so very dreadful dangers we have in great mercy escaped we are called to examine ourselves and search unto our sins as we are christians and as we are ministers for which the lord may have a controversy with us our not being so faithful in our personal and pastoral work in working out our oun and others salvation our impatience in not waiting the lords time but being too anxious to be in zetland at any rate and it is like in our not being so single in our ends in goeing as we ought to be etc i conclude this chap as the psalmist does ps  0  reflecting on the wonders of providence who is wise and will observe those things even they shall understand the loving kindness of the lord  chap ii a description of orkney its situation name first planters language manners of the people wholesomeness of the air corns etc the isles belonging to scotland have commonly been divided into three classes the western scaattered in the deucaledonian ocean the isles belonging to scotland divided into three classes on the west the orkney and zetlandick both lying to the north of scotland as to the western isles tho in number far exceeding both the isles of orkney and zetland yet i take no notice thereof in the subsequent descriptione r commission not being deputed thither so only the tter shall i give some brief account of not intending  advance any thing but what i have either found  be true from my own observation or had by good formation from sensible and grave persons worthy of edit and shall begin with orkney as order requires e first landing there  orkney lies to the north of scotland the situation of orkney bounded on e west by the deucaledonian ocean on the east by e german on the north by the sea which divides orkney from zetland and on the south by pightland rth    miles broad from dungisbiehead or john rots house the northermost house in scotland to urwick in southronaldsha the southernmost point of orkney it is commonly said to be about the   th degree of latitude at kirkwal which lies within the couney tho the southmost point of southronaldsha is istant from the northernmost of northronaldsha ear a degree  that orkney or orcades is the name of these isles concerning the name  agreed in by ancient and modern writers but of he etymology and whence the name is derived none  suppose will be found to give a satisfying account some alleging it to come from orcas which ptolomy reckons to be a promontory of caithness opposite to orkney others from the greek word  coerceo these isles breaking and restraining the force of the rageing waves or from hurricano because of the boisterous winds and hurricanes which often blow in this country or from erick or orkenwald or some other pictish prince famous there at its first plantation which derivations some of them at least cannot but appear far fetched to the thinking reader injuria temporis multa in oblivione jacent sepulta and indeed many in giving the reasons of names do rather please their own curiosity then render a true account of their original seeing the reasons generally of the ancient names of countries are buried in oblivion through the want of writers and neglect of the first inhabitants especially in these parts of the world wherein learning more slowly advanced  the  st possessors of the country the first planters and possessours of the country seem to have been the picts there being several old houses both here and in zetland which to this day are called picts or pights houses and the firth between orkney and caithness is still called ightland firth whereupon some of our historians as boethius writing of the isles of orkney does observe design orkney the most ancient kingdom of the picts boeth hist de orchad orchades insulae antiquissimum pictorum regnum a quibusdam

executioner boethius calls him balus balus autem orchadum rex fractus animo desperata salute ne in hostium potestatem ventret manum fibi intulit and in the church of birsa at the west end of the mainland in orkney there is a long stone yet standing erect with the name belus inscribed thereon in ancient characters probably this was the place of his interment also the minister of sandwicks manse is said to have been the residence of one of the kings of picts and therefore to this day is called koninggar or the kings house and that part of the manse which they say served for the palace

vanquishing of orkney has been reputed something considerable seeing not to every conqueror was llowed by the roman senate the glory of a triumph  it is also probable the government of these isles continued with the pictish princes till the days of kenneth  d king of scots a warlick prince who having prevailed with his nobles contrairy to their own inclintion by a notable piece of craft to engage in a war against the picts with an undaunted valor and courage routed the pictish army and wasted their country with fire and sword pursueing them to the orkney isles which he then annexed to the crown of scotland reignng from orkney to adrians wall anno dom     thence orkney continued in the possession of the scots till the days of donald bane about the year  0   who that he might secure the kingdom to himself promised the isles to magnus king of norway if he would assist im with a necessary force which offer magnus acceptng the norvegians became masters of the isles till alexander  d about the year      recovered them by xpelling the norvegians which ever since were possessed and disposed of by our kings to be brief at length william douglas earl of mortoun got a wadset of orkney and zetland from king charles the first which wadset with all the rights contracts infeftments etc therento appertaining was reduced by a decree of the lords of session obtained at the instance of his majestys advocate against william douglas also earl of mortoun grandchild to the foresaid earl february      which decree was ratified and confirmed by act of parliament he december following erecting the earldom of orkney and lordship of zetland into a stewartry to be calle in all time comeing the stewartry of orkney and zetland the reason commonly given why the earl of morto lost the wadset was because some chests of gol were seized by the earls deputs in zetland got out o a rich ship called the carmelan of amsterdam cast awa there anno      none of this gold coming to the kings thesaury tho some of it as was alleged cam to the earls hands  the contry of orkney and zetland reckoned considerable and the title honor able from our history we may know that orkney an zetland have been reckoned so great and considerable a part of his majestys ancient kingdom that for dive ages they occasioned much expense of blood and treasure for the maintaining thereof against the invasion  foreiners and recovering the same out of their hand by arms and treaties the title likewayes of the isles has still been reputed honorable hence it hat pleased our present king to confer this title of earl  orkney upon lord george hamilton brother to his gra the duke of hamilton for good services done by hi to his majestys person and government  the state of the country considered the people personable and hospitable their clothes i proceed to consider the present state of the country the people here are personable and comely an many of them as i observed are of a ruddy complexon which may be by reason of the sea air and their frequent fishdiet such a color and countenance as o mariners use to have and retain for some days afte they are come from sea they are generally hospitab and civil giving kind and humane entertainment t strangers which we found to our experience bot men and women are fashionable in their cloths  men here use plaids as they do in our highlands  the north isles of sanda westra etc many of the country people wear a piece of a skin as of a seal common called a selch calf or the like for shoes which the fasten to their feet with stringes or thongs of leathe their houses are in good order and well furnish according to their qualities  they generally speak english neither do i think their language hey have so much of the northern accent as in may places of the north of scotland yet several of the sles have some words and phrases peculiar to themselves there are also some who speak norse especial in the mainland as in the parish of hara there are a w yet living who can speak no other thing this anguage not being quite extinct among them since e norvegians whose language it is the air wholesome had this country  possession and tho caithness be near to orkney yet none n orkney can speak irish tho the greatest part in caithness can nor any in caithness speak norse tho some in orkney yet can do it  the air as it is peircing and cold hence many old persons so it is free and ealthy hence many arrive at a good old age one  evie brought forth a child in the    year of her ge as the minister who had enquired thereunto delared a man in the parish of holm who died not many years since lived with his wife in a conjugal ate above  0 years as the present minister of the lace informed me a gentleman in stronsa who died about two years since was begotten of his father when 00 years old this was attested by the ministers who new the truth thereof one william muir in westra lived  0 years and died about    years ago by a deay of natures heat and vigor incident to such an in decrepit age without any ordinary sickness as a gentleman in these bounds well acquainted with him old me they subject to the scurvy the disease they are most obnoxious unto  the scurvey occasioned as is judged by the seair fishes saltmeats etc it is observed likewayes that  is colder in the summer time then it is with us in e south but warmer in the winter the snow not sing to ly long for beside other things that might e said on this head the temperament of their climate which also respect other countries n the summer cold breezes come off the sea which empers the heat and in the winter season the same eezes may qualify the extreme cold and frost which uses to be greatest when the air is most quiescent a least disturbed with winds the great motion also of rapid tides may contribute not a little thereunto  their corns and bread their ordinary grains are oats and barley and  other grains should be sown the product would  be great if any at all they not taking with such a w and cold soil and the many brinish blasts these isles exposed unto as for wheatbread it is rare and sca to be had if not at kirkwal and some gentlemen houses who bring the flour from murray or the so of scotland as for their oats and barley the gra is less and blacker then it is with us yea tho the should bring good and fair seed from other countrey within a few years it would degenerate and beco like their own which is the reason why their me and bread are of such a black color yet in some plces the meal is whiter and said to be better then others their not being so diligent in winnowi their corns nor having such good mills for grind as we have may be partly the cause thereof in so place also they use not to shear their corn but pluc it up by the roots as we do the lint because of t scarcity of fodder to their beasts which corns if o taken pains upon will abound with sand and dul nevertheless for ought i hear or know their brea and ale are wholesome and the natives take we with them i thought first when we landed in orkne their oat bread and fleshes also had some fishtaste but when we had tarried some days there we we not so sensible of it  the nature of the soil and the product thereof their arable ground is better and more fertile the at first to strangers appears whence i heard so gentlemen declare it was wonderful to think ho great the product of these isles is considering the man barren mountains and much waste ground that are i them they dung their land for the most part wit seaware which having gathered they suffer to rot either on the coasts or by carrying it up to the lan on horses or on their backs they lay it in heaps the time of laboring approach which is the rea why the skirts of the isles are more ordinarily tivated and do more abound with corns then ces at a greater distance from the sea where they ve not such gooding at hand their ploughs are tle and light having only one stilt and but little n in them hence when at the end of the ridge  who holds it lifts it up and carries it to the other le of the ridge and if he please may carry it home  his shoulders the reason they give of this is that though some of their ground be strong yet their asts are weak and unable to go through with a plough any considerable weight  their horses kine sheep concerning their cattle and their price lambs etc are of a sser size then with us and are to be bought at an ser rate for a good cow will be had for   lib scots r   ib    ib at which price they are obliged to sell er at kkwal about martinmass a good wedder r  0 sh scots a hen for   sh or   sh   d etc the sheep here are generally wild therefore when hey would have them taken they ordinarily do it by dogs trained for the purpose the owner of the sheep giving to the master of the dog   shill scots for each me that is taken and it they be not so wild but   shill some husband men told us they would rather labor their land over again then take their sheep when they would have them washen and shorn i saw young man come from the hills wet and weary havng a long time pursued one to kill for our use their kine are of diverse colors some white others of a pyed some red others red and white etc no rivers but some brooks here which cause their mills to go so that  think there are as many of these colors as are of a black they have no rivers no place of the land being above   or   miles distant from the sea therefore they draw water out of wells for their cattle or drives them to lochs or lakes some whereof they have or to some small brooks which run from the lochs which lochs likewise cause their mills to go  plenty of cattle butter and milk they have abundance of cattle in many places whereby is afforded them plenty of milk which yields much butter some whereof is very good yellow and sweet but that which is called orkney butter edinburgh is only their farmbutter which they a obliged to pay to the taxmen or masters whereof quantity according to compact and agreement being gathered they are at little or no trouble to make a keep it clean their sheep also are very fruitful man of them having two and some three at a birth which as mr wallace lately boeth hist de orcad so boethius of old did observe oves illic pene omnes geminos immo trigeminos pleraeq partus edunt  their fishes fishes of diverse sorts are taken in great plenty y not so numerous as formerly for now before the catch their great fishes as keelling ling etc the must put far out into the sea with their little boats an thereby undergo great danger which in former time they used to get nearer the coasts however such number is taken that beside what serves for their own supply many are sent abroad to other countries for sale particularly there are gray fishes called silluks scarce half so big as a herring generally which swee and are taken in great numbers upon the coasts  that sometimes they will sell  000 of them for   or still scots this fish is pleasant to the taste and also they say very wholesome which seems to be confirmed by this that in the late years of great scarcity the poorer people lived upon them almost as their only food they often not enjoying a crum of bread so many weeks so our good god on the shutting o one door opened another in his holy and wise providence for the relief of the poor  herrings herrings do sweem here in abundance which formerly occasioned several ships frequenting these isles but since the battle of kilsyth they say that trad th failed many of the enster men who were ordiry fishers upon these coasts being killed there hen i was in papa westra they pointed out to me a olm upon the east side of the isle where i saw the ines of some huts or little houses whereunto these nster men sometimes resorted during the herringhing a gentleman living in this isle told me that e former year      there was a great quantity of erring sperm or spawn driven upon the shore and y there for some time in heaps which evidenceth at herrings in their season are yet on these coasts o means be not used to take them  beside the many other excellent fishes as keeling many other good fishes ing scate turbot and sometimes they say stureon etc there are also many shell fishes taken as lobsters sold for an half penny or   pen scots oisters uch bigger then with us for   shill scots per  00 artens and mussels and cockles in so great plenty that they make much good lime of their shells lime made of cockle shells beside which they have no other lime in orkney save what hey bring from the south  they have plenty both of land and sea fowls plenty of fowls as eagles hawks embergoose claikgoose dunergoose solengoose swans lyres scarffs keriwaiks lover muirfowl duck and drake etc the kings falconer uses to go every year to these sles taking the young hawks and falcons to breed and every house in the country is obliged to give him a hen or a dog except such as are exempted the eagles do much hurt to the young store falling down upon their lambs and hens and taking them away with them to their nests killing and pulling out the eyes and hearts of their sheep hence there is an act standing in the stewards books that whoever shall kill an eagle shall have a hen out of every house of the parish where he is killed yet notwithstanding of this encouragement i hear but of few killed they fleeing high and dispatching their prey so quickly i saw a young one in the palace of birsa almost twi the bigness of a goose tho not a month old it is ravenous fowl and would have run upon us if we h not kept it of with our slaves as to its color it  for the most part black and something of a yellow  golden color about the head and in some parts o the wings it is observed of the eagle that he do more destruction in places at some distance from honest then in these that are nearer it eagles haw and such like fowls have their nests ordinarily o some high ragged rock washen by the sea beneath some of which we saw as we had occasion to sail b them  an account of the embergoose the embergoose tho not altogether so big as ou landgoose yet it uses to weigh a stone weight i has short wings not able to bear up the body for fleeing hence it is never seen flee neither sit on an rock in the sea as other fowls do but has it is nest wherein it hatcheth its eggs one or two at once under the water at the foot of a rock as they informed me has been found it is of a darkish gray color and white about the neck of broad feet like ou landgoose and a long beck and tho ever in the water yet has not i think such a strong fish taste a the solengoose it is more difficult to get them shot then other sea fowls they being very quicksighted and on the  st apprehension of danger get beneath the water yea by reason of their many feathers they will receive a shot on their breast and it not penetrate wherefore who would be at them design for their heads or to shoor them against the feathers and lyre the lyre is a rare and delicious sea fowl so very fat that you would take it to be wholly fat it is somewhat less then a duck  seafowls numerous the seafowls are so numerous that a gentleman in westra told his minister that some years ago he for his own part killed so many as afforded him  0  0 and some years  00 stone weight of feathers hereby accrues to the owners more gain then by e flesh of the fowls tho for some seasons past he th taken but few for it is observed that these wls follow the small fishes which are their ordiry food hence the mo fishes the mo fowls and hen the fishes forsake this and the other place the wls likewise do so within a short time because of is abundance of fowls therefore it is that the entlemen and some others have the rocks in several aces divided among them as they have their land which fowls they either kill by small shot our of boats  the foot of the frequented rocks or else men are let own by ropes from the top of the rocks who search r the nests taking the eggs and what fowls they n apprehend many kinds of the seafowls are of a yed color some of which are not to be found with s in the south  there are here no partridges no partridges but abundance of muirfowls but plenty of muirowls hence in some isles they will take  0  0 or o pair in one day the hills covered with heather eing by nature fitted for their living and accommoation conies also do abound in most of the isles but o hares are to be seen no hares but rabbets in abundance so that if any be brought into he country as they say has been tried they will ot live and propagate as in other places i hear of ew if any venomous creatures in these isles as boeius of old did observe boeth hist de orcad serpents aut aliud animal veneosum nullum id quod de hiborma quoque verum est no bees either are here no venomous creatures there being no provision proper or them beside they would not take well with this old climate  no trees there are in this country nor bushes no trees ave a few in the bishops garden at kirkwal which re esteemed as a rarity for when planted and taken are of they sometime grow up the height of their garden wall but afterward they gradually go back and decay this several gentlemen very desirous of aving trees to grow declared which then must be imputed to the nature of the soil and sharpness the seaair and not to the sloth of the inhabitant as our historian asserts nulla usquam arbor ac ne fr tex quidem praeter ericam buchan hist l   nec id tam coeli aut so v quam incolarum ignavia quod facile ostenditur ex arbo radicibus quae pluribus in locis eruuntur for tho ind it be true that roots and sometimes bodies of tree are found in mosses yet this is rare and only to be ha in some places whereas gentlemen say they brin in exotic or foreign plants they sow seed for nurseries which uses to arrive at some greater growth then what is planted yet after all their pains and expense in using such proper means so conducive for obtaining their end no perfection or bearing of frui can be attained and that trees which yet are b small and look dry and withered do grow in the bishops garden may be because of its enclosure having the church on one side the town of kirkwal on another and the bishops house on a third which kind of fences may keep off the cold breezes that come from the sea and destroy the growth of tree in other places  tho there be no trees and so no fruits for the table good roots yet there is no lack of good roots for the kitchen as cabbage carrots parsnipes turnipes crummocks artichoaks etc all which uses to be bigger here then with us ordinarily especially their artichoaks excel hence some gentlemen do barrel and send them out of the country for a present to their friends beside these they have likewise variety of herbs in the field very beneficial to such as understand their virtue and use  pites and turff are the ordinary fuel they use which they have very good and in great plenty through the country their fuel except in some places which do not so abound therewith as in sanda they are obliged to bring pites from the adjacent isles they not having in their own isle to suffice them and the usual ner of agreement with the proprietor of the s is for so much a day for so many peits as a man  cast and in such places where there is scarcity ewel the poorer sort make use of dried kines dung tangles which in summers heat they prepare for the nters cold they have a few saltpans in some ces where plenty of pites which are very useful to  country at some times much timber the ack of ships cast away at sea or broken on their s is driven ashore which the inhabitants seizing p for burnwood and if good and fresh as somees ships from norway suffer shipwreck upon or nigh these isles they make other uses of it i saw seve chimney pieces thereof the more ignorant people nstruct this as a favorable providence to them theree they call these wracks gods send tho not so favoure to the poor mariners and others who suffer there  although the sea seems to favor them dangerous sailing here by inging such timber and sometimes casks and ogsheads of wine brandy etc to their doors yet is turbulent swelling sea and strong current of a ide pays them home sore for frequently thereby their shall passage or fisherboats are cast away sometimes  in them perishing at other times some saved with fficulty and at all times it is highly dangerous r any not experienced with these seas to pass rough between the isles tho with small boats beuse of the many blind rocks lying there upon which ometimes the inhabitants themselves do spleet what rough some mistake inadvertency darkness of the ight or otherwise  the ministers inform us even to the inhabitants they are often in great anger in going to their churches from isle to isle visiting their parishes going to the presbytry etc ometimes pale death with its grim countenance resenting it self and stareing them in the face as ne drawn out by the hair of the head another escaping on the keel of the overwhelmed boat somtimes they are arrested by a storm in the isles a kept from their own families for some weeks eve when the passage will be scarce a mile or half a mi over they tell us in the isle of westra there w a marriage not long since where about  00 person were conveened from other isles and were detaine for   or   weeks together so that tho many of the daily saw their own houses yet they durst not adveture to pass over till the falling wind and sea too off their confinement  in every isle there is a wart or wardhill the highest hill in the isle the warthill on the top whereof they use to kindle a fire when they saw an enemy approaching or discerned any danger that so they mig alarm the neighborhood that the dispersed inhabtants of the country having thereby notice given the might conveen for their succor or be upon the own defense which beacons on the tops of mountains the scripture makes mention of as isa  0  and a late learned author asserteth edwards scrip style vol   chap   that great fla with smoke rising up out of the city which was appoint as a sign between the men of israel and the liars in wa judge  0     0 seems to be meant by this  the proprietors of the country there are several gentlemen in orkney who ha considerable estates but the king is the great proprietor having about the one half of the rents of t whole country which rents are let out to taxme for so much per annum as is agreed upon at the public roup who by their deputes gather in the rvenues of the crown and being the kings stewar they are the principal judges of the country t rents when collected whether paid in mone meal oats barley or butter are ordinarily sent sou which causes a great grudge among the people some  them thereby being redacted to great straits not getti meal barley or the like sometimes to buy as in t late dearth tho then the product of these isles comparatively were beyond that of many other places in e kingdom the bishops rents amounting to   or 00 merks per annum and so more considerable then e rents of several other bishoprics in the kingdom w since the abolition of prelacy coming in to the ings treasury and at his disposal are also sent uth and not consumed within the isles as they used rmerly to be when the bishops resided here at which e people are likewise dissatisfied and thereby as some etter acquainted with their humors and inclinations do form me the presbyterian government is made the ess acceptable to many of them  the people greatly cry out of the oppression they groan under the peopel complain of oppression by reason of the frequent change of stewrds their masters who being taxmen and so only o continue for such a definite time each endeavors o gather in his rents and that as soon as may be which many of the poor people cannot get so quickly given whereupon several of them are put to doors and all taken from them which has occasioned much of the kings land now to be lying waste and lee whereas if they always had one master their circumstances might be much better for sometimes it so falls out that the husbandman will gain as much in one year as will compense the loss of another the master likewise would be more encouraging to them and concerned in their welfare and they having leasses set them would more endeavor the improving of their ground which now they do not they not knowing but the next year they may have a new master whose little finger may be thicker then his predecessors loins yet let not my reader judge that i hereby intend the impeachment of any particular person or persons who have been taxmen there or now are but my design is to show that this is the common complaint of the country both in orkney and zetland  the gentlemen tell us their holding they have another kind of holding here then is in other places and the best right they have to their lands is that which they call udall right a possession which the natives successively have without either charter or seasin all their lands being either such udall land or kings lands or fewed lands this udall right is said to be called from one ulans king of norway who when he possessed the country gave to the inhabitants a right to so much land he always retaining to himself the  d part and enjoying the increase thereof  measure their measure is not the same with ours they not useing peck and firlot but in stead thereof weigh their corns on pismires or pundlers the least quantity is called a merk which is    ounces    merks make a leispound or setten which with the danes is that which we call a stone modern account of denmark   settens a meil which is their boll and    meils make a chalder neither do they use pocks or sacks as we do but carries and keeps their corns and meal in a sort of vessels made of straw bound about with ropes of the same called cassies  chap iii wherein the several isles and parishes belonging to orkney are enumerated and briefly described having geven some description of orkney in general the number of the orkney isles i shall now give some more particular account of the several isles thereunto belonging which are divided into such as are inhabited and so are more commonly called isles and such as are not inhabited which they call holms only useful for pasturage the isles are said to be    in number viz pomona or the mainland being much larger then any of the rest gramsey hoy swinna southronaldsha burra lambholm flotta faira cava copinsha shapinsha damsay inhallo gairsa rousa eaglesha stronsa papastronsa eda northfaira westra papawestra wyre sanda and northronaldsha to which may e added poghtland skerries it being sometimes inhabited in the summer time and waes which in a high ream is divided from hoy whereunto it is joined by low and narrow neck of land as also the calf of eda it having a salt pan in it it may be observed that most of the names of these isles end in a or ey which in the teutonick tongue signifies water to show that these isles are pieces of land surrounded with water  the first is pmona or the mainland pomona or the mainland  the town of kirkwal described   said to be    miles in length from east to west and in some places  or   miles broad nigh to the middle whereof is the town of kirkwal about   quarters of a mile in length from south to north the only remarkable town in ll this country and beside which there is no other royalburgh in orkney or zetland the danes who ad the orcades long in possession called it cracoviaca which name buchanan takes to be the same with kirkwal but corrupted quod dani cracoviacam appela bant nunc nomine corrupto kircua scotis dicitur it andeth upon the north side of the isle in a low and moist ground hence a minister in this country told me that in several places of their large church where he more respected burgers ordinarily bury their dead they can scarce dig two foot of earth but water will rise so that he has seen when they interred the corpse hey behoved to press them down in the water till the mold or earth was cast upon them it is now much ecayed as to trade and number of inhabitants as many ancient burghs in this kingdom are in it has een two stately edifices the kings and the bishops palace he former is now very ruinous being the ancientest f the two built as is thought by some of the bishops f orkney it having the vestige of a bishops mitre and arms engraven upon the wall that looks to the reet and in which it is said the bishops of old had their residence the other called the bishops palace wherein the bishops lately lived was built by patrick stewart earl of orkney anno   0  son to robe stewart natural son to king james the  th this palace i also goeing to ruin tho with some expense i could be keept in good repair  the church of kirkwal the church is a very noble and large structure having in it    or    strong pillars on each side the teeple standing on   bigger and higher pillars in the middle of the church wherein there are several old an good bells in the easter part only of this great church is divine service performed which is furnished with good seats for accommodating the inhabitants and other conveniences proper for that end it i commonly called st magnus church being built  at least as some say the foundation laid by magnus king of norway whom they report to have bee buried here tho others say he was buried in eagle sha an isle to the north of kirkwal there are many of this name of magnus in this country  a safe road at kirkwal at kirkwal there is a safe road but ships comin from the south cannot get so easily into it by reason that the same wind which brings them to orkney often will not suffer them to turn up to kirkwal the being obliged to encompass a point of land stretchin to the northeast before they can make the road  that frequently they ly at elwick or deersound tw anchoring places to the east or northeast of kirw until that the wind shall favor them  goodgrass and corn in some places of the mainland  the kings house in ea   on the mainland good corns do grow in several plces tho likewayes there be much moorish ground b the pleasentest part of the isle i take to be the west e thereof about birsa hara sandwick and stromness when there are several spots well furnished with grass a corn in the parish of birsa is the kings house situaton a plain champain ground on the west end of t mainland nigh to the sea or deucaledonian ocean whi rmerly when in order has had several pleasant and dierting avenues about it at a large quarter of a miles istance to the south we saw the pleasantest mixture of owans so commonly called or daisies white and yellow n every side of the way growing very thick and coering a considerable piece of the ground that ever ve had occasion to see the palace was built in form f a court by robert stewart earl of orkney about the ear      it is two stories high the upper has been rettily decored the ceiling being all painted and that for the most part with schems holding forth scripurehistories as noahs flood christs riding to jersalem etc and the scripture is set down beside the fiure it was inhabited within these  0 years but is ow fast decaying when we entered the palace gate we w above it that inscription so much talk of and reuted treasonable by king james the  th robertus  steuartus filius jacobi  ti rex scotorum hoc aedificium instruxit which inscription could not but offend he lawful heir of the croun for it cannot well be hought that the earl and all about him were such blunderers in the latin tongue as to put down rex in stead of regis if there had been no design in it within he palace we saw also the motto above his arms sic uit est and erit which was a piece of too great arrogance or any man to assume that unto himself which properly belongs to the son of god whose wise judgment is not unworthy of our remark that now only t can be said of his house and family now extinct dan     ic suit which that great king nebuchadnezar knew o his experience that these who walk in pride god is able to abase  among other pleasant places in this west end of the mainland we may take notice of kirfalhill kirfal hill a little to the east of the house of brachness in the parish of sandwick which is very large on the top and plain almost like a bowlinggreen so that   or  0000 men could easily be drawn up in order thereupon it is all over very green without any heath or such like growing there neither are there any rising hillocks on it that we could discern as ordinarily are to be seen on other hills and because of it is being so very pleasant the inhabitants about call it chearfulhill loch of stennis within a few miles also of he west end of the mainland is the loch of stenni the largest in orkney whereon are some mills some trouts and salmongilses are found in it and the brooks that run from it  several good harbors on the mainland beside kirkwalroad there are several other harbors or bays on the mainland wherein ships can safely ly as one at kerston a small village at the west end of the mainland much frequented by ships going to the west of scotland or ireland or coming therefrom another is at holmssound toward the southeast side of the isle to which sometimes barks do resort from the south several ships also going through land from the south to the westsea drop anchor here and when they pass they must sail between lambholm a little isle in the sound and the mainland for the way on the other side between lambholm and burra tho it seem more open yet it is they say shallow and dangerous but none i think will dare to sail through these isles without some measure both of skill and experience else it will be to the hazard of their lives and the loss of ship and cargo there being several turnings blindrocks and shallows wherefore many do judge it the safest course to keep the widesea and so sail without the isles especially if the weather be not well set and promising another convenient road is at deersound to the east of the mainland where a great bay commodious for navies to ride in some other harbors and bays also there are upon the mainland but these are the most remarkable  a ship cast away nigh to the point of deerness some years ago was cast away a ship transporting some prisoners to america who were for the most part westcountry men apprehended emprisoned and then banished for adhering to presbyterian principles there were as is said love  00 who perished being kept under the hatches ed together by pairs whereas if they had been at lirty the greatest part if not all might have been sav as a few were then upon deck with the mariers the country people here did and do think that e captain of the ship willingly suffered her to drive on this point and the men there to perish and if so is probable that others tho not aboard have been ncerned in this mischievous desing as the authors d abettours thereof  in the mainland are  parishes but    kirks the isle of copinsha for any ministers in orkney have   and some   kirks herein they ordinarily preach by turns the first is eerness and st andrews at the east end of the isle here two kirks one at deerness and another at st ndrews wherein their minister preaches by turns re live the lairds of newwork and tankerness under s ministers inspection also is copinsha a little islle to e east of the main wherein a few families some rnland and pasturage it at a little distance appears  be as an high rock conspicuous to sea men but it clineth and lies low toward the west to the north st of it lies a holm called the horse of copinsha  the next parish is holm also on the east of the ain to the west of deerness and st andrews the isle of lambholm wherein is t one kirk in

to per vices to stromness belongs kerston wh the best harbor in orkney and by reason it is daily icreasing as to houses and number of inhabitants w are encouraged to dwell here upon the account of t many ships that do frequent this port and often tarry sometime the minister and gentlemen concur in suplicating judicatories competent that kerston wi some of the country adjacent may be erected into  parish by it self that so the inhabitants of the pl and strangers resorting thereunto may be served wi preaching and other parts of the pastoral work the present church at stromness being   miles distant from them wherein also they can have sermon but eve other sabbath in sandwick lives the lord of brach  to the south of stromness and sandwick lies hoy waes which ordinarily make but one isle tho someti by a high sream overflowing the low and narrow paage the isle of hoy and waes whereby they are joined to one another they divided into two the isle is about  0 or    miles lo from west to east waes at the east end of the isle better inhabited then hoy at the west end thereof lying lower and so fitter for pasturage and labourg whereas hoy is more mountainous only having so houses on the skirts of the hills by the coasts a some corn land about their houses the h of hoy is the highest in orkney whence we have a  prospect of all the circumjacent isles as also of caith stranaver sutherland etc on the south side of pgland firth yet tho it be so high it cannot hold  what some do assert that from this hill is to be seen  sun all the night over in the month of june when out the tropic of cancer for seeing the sun is  several hours seen above the horizon the shortest  of winter he must necessarly be so far depressed shortest night in summer so that his body cannot  be seen tho something of a clear light may be erned as it were accompanying the sun from his sett to his rising point by reason of the reflection and action of his rays upon and through the sea he ping so little below their horizon for the further strating of this the ministers of the northernisles orkney told me that in the month of june they will  to read small print or write at midnight and in cember for some days they can neither see to read  write unless that they light a candle as one of m attested from his experience to the south of the try into the sound between hoy and kerston in the

gramsey a little pleasant isle about a mile ng lying to the north of hoy between it and kerston  the mainland but ships that go through this sound e to sail between gramsay and the mainland the way tween gramsay and hoy being very dangerous the inister of waes has two kirks the isle of flotta faira and cava one in waes and anher in flotta a pleasant little isle and as capable of provement as any isle in orkney faira and cava also o other little isles are a part of his charge these isles  to tha east of waes and hoy  nigh to the east of waes and hoy lies southronalda   miles long from north to

ordinary assage is to duncansbay in caithness over pightland firth their minister has three kirks two in southronaldha one at the southend of the isle called our ladyskirk and another at the northend called st pe kirk the isle of burra he has a  d kirk in burra a pleasant little isl the north of southronaldsha wherein much cornla and many rabbets in this isle lives sir archb steuart the isle of

has a plea situation on a rising ground lying to the south  isles of stronsa and papa stronsa to the northeast from shapinsha lies stronsa bout   or   miles long it is well inhabited and t grass and corns are good papa stronsae is a little i over against it toward northeast wherein but o family between papastronsa and stronsa is a safe habour or bay well fenced by romontories or capes  land it is said to be the best northbound harbour all the northern isles opposite to stronsa to northwest lies eda about   miles of length from north t south the isle of eda it is full of moss and moor and but thinly inhabited some of the neighouring isles get their pite hence in it a loch and mill to the northeast o eda is the caf a holm so called between which an eda is calfsound a convenient and safe

the isle of northfatra   the house of calfsound on the east side of eda stands a house built b john stewart earl of carrick an      some  whose off spring are yet living in the neighbourin isles the occasion of his coming and living in this remote corner is reported to have been some disconte which tell out between him and his lady he built a a great expense    saltpans in the calf of eda ov

to north in many places a mile or a mile and  half and in some scarce half a mile broad having veral tongues of land washen by the sea hence some o compare it to the shape of a lobster no place in the le is high and mountainous and many spots of it are ery plain and even like a bowlinggreen everyhere it is well furnished with grass and much good orn said to be the best in orkney it alone pays to e king    chalders of victual every one of which hlders is    bolls of our measure the whole isle  but as one rich cuningar or a cony warren for i ever saw a greater number of conies running in any lace then i did here hence the heretors kill everal hundreds of them yearly for their use there e several bays for ships as kitletoft oterswick and aphness bay some gentlemen also who have consierable interests as burgh lapness etc many fowls equent this isle as duck and drake plover etc o that there is good sport for the fowler the stirns or stares are as numerous i judge as the sparows are with us  in sanda are two ministers one having one kirk alled ladykirk on the east side of the isle toward he north end thereof in this isle are some sober nowing and good people particularly in this lady parish in the former presbyterian times there was a godly zealous minister mr arthur murray who went south after the revolution an    0 and died here some of the old people yet alive who were uner his ministry cannot speak of him without tears the righteous shall he had in everlasting rememberance the other minister has under his inspection three kirks two in sanda cross kirk and burness and one in northronaldsha an isle to the north of sanda two or three miles long both these isles of sanda and northronalsha ly low the isle of north ronalsha and dangerous for seamen who cannot discover them at any distance especially in a misty day or dark night till close upon them and so are ready to suffer ship wrack as many do  the isle of westra to the west of sanda lies westra seven miles long it is well inhabited having much corn in it here is ftta hill where they say the fairies are frequently seen it is the highest hill in all the northern isles of orkney in the north end of this isle is the castle of noutland built by gilbert balfour for the use o james hepburn earl of bothwell the castle of noutland married to queen mary the    of may an      in the abbey of holy roodhouse who fearing he should not always retain and enjoy his present grandeur which the nobles envied him for he likewise being suspected guilty of the murder of my lord darli her former husband caused build this strong castle which upon a change of the scene he might betake himself unto situated upon a rock nigh to the deucaledonian ocean having plain champain ground about it it is   stories high and the lowest is strongly vaulted above which i a large hall having two airholes through the arch so to give a vent to the powder if at any time they showld be surprised with a blast the walls ar very thick and all the free stone for the building was brought from the south the roof is flat and fenced with rayls of stone whence we have a sai view of the circumjacent country there are severa hols or slits in the building not only to let in the light but to gall an approaching enemy with small shot if at any time they should be attacked but the lord often taking the sinner in his own craftiness uffered him not so to escape by sheltering himself in this nest this castle was never completed for in one part thereof the walls are but half the height inended and never hitherto covered with a roof and e being pursued by the lords of the congregation never possessed it or so much as saw it if not at a distance for he taking himself to sea with two or three ships came to kirkwal in orkney and being driven thence by william kircaldy of grange he fled to zetland where the pursuer had almost overtaken him if the pilots skill in these seas had not made a way to escape in holding down by the side of a blind rock well enough known to the pilot which the pursuer ignorant of spleet upon which rock to this day is called the unicorn from the name of the ship that perished upon it bothwel escaped to norway where being apprehended he was taken to denmark and cast into a filthy prison where he died after  0 years imprisonment his wicked life having this miserable end tho hand join in hand the wicked shall not go unpunished and ordinarily murder whereof he was suspected to be guilty so cries from the ground that it brings down remarkable and often tremendous judgments in time there are several gentlemens houses in westra  the minister of westra has three churches wherein he preaches per vices two in westra one at the west end of the isle called the westkirk and another nigh to the north end called the northkirk the third church is in papawestra a little isle of   miles long from south to north the isle of papawestra betwixt it and westra there is a convenient harbor for ships at piriwa as also in the same sound a little to the north of this harbor lies a holm wherein there has been a little chapel whereof some of the ruinous walls are yet to be seen papawestra abounds with rabbets and has some corn land but not so much as some other isles it being hard and stonny ground it belongs to a gentleman called holland and has been reputed famous for st trodwells chapel and loch or lake to the ea of this isle lies the holm where the easter men had their hutts as above  the isle of rousa to the south of westra lies rousa an isle   miles long full of heathy hills abounding with moor fowls there is not much corn in it and but thinly inhabited there is a loch and mill thereon that goes ordinarily all the summer over which is rare in these isles the minister of rousa has two kirks one in rousa and another in eglesha the isle of eglesha a pleasant isle two mils long where a church much frequented by superstitious people with a high steeple seen at a great distance where as some would have it st magnus was buried to his charge also belongs inhallo the isle of inhallo a little isle to the west of rousa also wyre a small isle  the number of parishes thus i have glanced at the description of the orcades most of which i have had occasion to see wherein we see there are    parishes   in the mainland viz kirkwall holm deerness and st andrews evie and rendat firth and stennis orphir brsa and hara sandwick and stromness and   in the other isles sciz south ronalsha and burra waes and flotta hoy and gramsey shapinsha stronsa and eda lady kirk in sanda cross kirk and burness in sanda and north ronalsha westra and papa westra rousa and eglesha but there are    kirks and these ministers look upon themselves as more happily posted who have only one kirk especially if they have not more kirks in several isles this tending more to the edification of the people under their charge and consequently to their peace and encouragement they every lords day dispensing ordinances in the same place to the same people whereas these who have more kirks committed to them are sometimes obliged to preach in one place and sometimes in another and the people generally frequent but their ou kirk especially if they be in different isles hence ordinarily they enjoy the ordinances only every other sabbath and in some places t one of three which cannot but obstruct the pross of the gospel among them besides it is uneasy ensive and dangerous for them to travel from isle to e and sometimes a storm arising they are necessarily ained there the stipends here are small and for  most part paid by the stewart or his depute the ng being the principal proprietour yet they can e very well upon them victuals being had at an ie rate  the people are generally tractable people respectful of their ministers submissive and pectful to their ministers which is very desirable d encouraging to these who labor among them hen true zeal enlarges the desires and puts an ge upon the spirits of pastors in the discharge of the rds work for the good of souls  chap iv ome things remarkable in orkney as ancient monuments strange providence etc are represented having taken a view of the country in general things remarkable in orkney and the several isles in particular i shall now diert my reader with some things remarkable not together unworthy of our observation such as some ncient monuments strange accidents and some her things not only curious and delectable but also ofitable to the judicious affording matter of meditation to the wise observers of these things who regard the works of the lord and duly ponder the operation of his hands in the years of ancient and latter times  the first we take notice of is the stone the dwrfie stone called the warfie stone lying in a valley between two hills to e north of the hill of hoy it is about    foot long   or    broad and   thick hollowed by the hand of some mason as the print of the masonirons do  show it has a square hole for the entry looking the east   foot high with a stone proportionab standing before this entry at   foot distance with at one end is hewn out a bed with a pillow where two persons may ly almost at their full length oppsite to this at the other end is something also hew out like a couch between which bed and couch the is a large hole above about the bigness of the entry through which a person may come up to the top  the stone and might serve for a vent to the smok if so be they had put any fire upon a hearth betwe the two beds beneath this stone runs to the south cold and pleasant spring which might afford drink the inhabitant who hewed this stone or for wh use it was we could not learn the common traditi among the people is that a giant with his wi lived in this isle of hoy who had this stone for the castle but i would rather think seeing it could  accomodate any of a gigantick stature that it mig be for the use of some dwarf as the name seems import or it being remote from any house might the retired cell of some melancholic hermit t stone also may be called the dwarfie stone per aphrasin or by way of opposition it being so  great  something shines wonderfully on the warthill of hoy to the northwest of this stone is an high motain of a steep ascent called the warthill of hoy looing to the north nigh to the top of which hill ab midday is seen something and that at a good stance which glitters and shines wonderfully a tho some have climbed up and searched for it  could find nothing it shines most in the summer ti the people talk of it as some enchanted carbcle others take it to be a water that reflecteth  suns rays and so causes such a sparkling and spldour but a gentleman who lives nigh to  rock told us that is shines most in the greatest drought hen no water is near it  at the west end of the mainland a street of stones of different figures about a mile d an half to the west of the house of skeal on the p of high rocks there is something like a street ear to a quarter of a mile in length and between  and  0 foot in breadth all laid with stones of fferent figures and magnitudes of a reddish cour some of which stones bear the image and reprentation of a heart others of a crown others of a hoe a leg a last a weavers shuttle etc and that which renders it yet the more strange is when these ones are raised many of them have the same figure and ape below on the one side that they have above on e other which street all beholders look on as very wonderful i saw a part of the garden wall of the house of skeal decored in the forepart thereof with hese stones we intended to have sent a parcel of them outh to our friends as a rarity if they had not been orgot at our return from zetland whether these tones be so laid and figured by art or by nature will e hard to determine for there is no house nigh to his street neither are the ruins of any which formery have been there to be seen so puzling are the works of god to the most ingenious and accurate observers of providence  at the loch of stennis in the mainland a circle of stones in that part thereof where the loch is narrowest both on the west and east side of the loch there is a ditch within which there is a circle of large and high stones erected the larger round is on the west side above 00 paces diameter the stones set about in form of  circle within a large ditch are not all of a like quantity and size tho some of them i think are upwards of  0 foot high above ground   or   foot broad and a foot or two thick some of which stones are fallen but many of them are yet standing between which there is not an equal distance but many of them are about  0 or    foot distant from  other on the other side of the loch over which  pass by a bridge laid with stones after the manner of street the loch there being shallow are two ston standing of a like bigness with the rest whereof o has a round hole in the midst of it at a little distan from which stones there is another ditch about ha a mile from the former but of a far less circumferenc within which also there are some stones standing something bigger then the other stones on the we side of the loch in form of a semicircle i think rather then of a circle opening to the east for i s no stones that have fallen there save one which wh standing did complete but the semicircle both  the east and west end of the bigger round are tw green mounts which appear to be artificial in on of which mounts were found mr wallace desciption of orkney says mr wallace   fibulae of silver round but opening in one plac like to a horseshoe  it is most probably thought that these were the high places in times of pagan idolatry whereon sacrifice were offered and that the two artificial mounts o earth served for the same purpose or were the places where the ashes of the sacrifices were cast as some w i have  bothius in the life of manu king o scot observes that the people called these hug stones drawn together in the form of a circle the ancient temples of the gods beeth in vitam mains vt populus ad religionem moventur priscis sacris novas quasdam and solenne ceen onas superaddidit rex nimium mainus du immo taibus peragendas ut immensis saxis varus in regionu locis ut res exposcebat in coronidem admotis eorumqu maximo ad meridiem porrecto cujus pro ara foret usus victimae ibi diis immortalibus sacrificium cremarentur ex tantum i fidem vel hoc nostro avo ingentia ea saxa auct in circo prisca deorum phana vulgus appellar many o the country do say that in the larger round the sun and in the lesser the moon was worshipped by e old pagan inhabitants of these isles  and indeed to build their altars of earth or unpohed stones seems to have been the custom of ancient mes and even of the first ages of the rom empire apologet chap     the learned spencer endeavors to prove from tertullian etsi a numa concepta est curisitas superstitiosa nondum tamen aut simulacris aut templis res divina apud romanos constabat frugi religio and pauperes ritus and nulla capitolia certantia coelo spencer de legihus hebraeorum sed temeraria de cespite altaria and vasa adhuc samia and nidor ex illis and deus ipse nusquam and further confirming the same from cluverius writing of the german antiquities and concludes with giving the rean why the gentiles of old were so taken with rude digested artless and unpolished altars and places of orship because they judged them more holy and ore acceptable to the gods gentes antiquae says he natura vel traditione doctae naturalia omnia rudia licet and impolita sanctiora and diis suis gratiom crediderunt and here in these monuments nothing ke art or form the stones are not polished nor all of  like thickness height or breadth nor of an equal ditance from each other  in the isle of sanda there is a chapel called the chapel of cet wherein there is a grave    foot long great bones found in sanda which when opened some years ago there was nothing ound in it save the piece of a backbone of a man reater then the backbone of any horse this the minister of the place declared unto me who saw the grave opened and measured it from the head to the oot stone thereof who also for some time had the one in his custody the vulgar tradition is that here was a giant there who was of so tall a stature that he could have stood upon the ground and put the copstone upon the chapel which no man now livng by far could do and in westra   there are also bones found in westra between tukey and the west church as great as horsebones as the minister of westra informed me and some there have been lately of a gigantick stature in these isles a that man who died not long since whom for hi height they commonly called the meikle man of waes  several obelisks through the country through this country we find several obelsiks o very high and great stones set up as one in the isle o eda another on the mainland within a mile of b etc they appear to be much worn by the washing o wind and rain which shows they are of a long standing and it is very strange to think how in these place and times they got such large stones carried and erected mirabile profecto quisquis ea spectaverit boeth in vitam maus qua art quibus corporis viribus lapides tanta mole in unu locum fuerint congesti the reason and end of their setting up cannot be certainly known however we may conjecture that probably it was in remembrance of some famous battle or has been the ancient funeral monuments of some renouned persons who have fallen i battle or been buried there several of which stone and monuments are to be seen in many places through scotland and in norway they are very common a our travelers who have seen them inform me an it is like these stones have been set up by the norvegians when they possessed this country  the bishops of orkney at their  st landing used to be presented with a large cup full of strong drink in scapha about a mile from kirkwal to southwe it is said there was kept a large and ancient cup which they say belonged to st magnus king of norway wh first instructed them in the principles of the christian religion and founded the church of kirkwal with which fu of some strong drink their bishops at their first landin were presented which if he drank out they highly praied him and made themselves to believe that the should have many good and fruitful years in his tim this buchannan relates and as mr wallace observet is still believed there and talked of as a truth scyphu habent antiquum says buchannan quem divi magn qui primus ad eos christi doctrinam attulit fuisse praed cant is cum ita superet communium poculorum amplitudinem ut e lapitharum convivio reservatus videri possit eo suos episcopos initio ad se adventantes explorant qui plenum uno haustu ebiberit quod admodum raro evenit miris cum laudibus prosequuntur atque hinc velut laeto augurio sequentium annorum proventum animis praecipiunt the country o this day have the tradition of this but we did not e the cup nor could we learn where it was and deed that which renders this the more credible is at the norvegians at present as merchants and mariers inform us have a custom like unto this that if any ome to pay them a visit especially if they be strangers hey use to present them with a large cup full of drink which they take not well if their guests drink not out they say some of these cups will contain three mutchkins others a pint and some a quart of our measure  the wind and sea the sea in a storm beats most vehemently on the rocks in any storm beats most tempestuously and vehemently here upon the rocks a ittle to the west of kerston in the mainland there is a rock called the black craig of stromness about  0 fathoms high upon which in a storm the sea from the deucaledonian ocean does beat with such violence and force that the waves breaking thereupon cause the water to rise to the top of the rock like snow and flee like a whit sheet before the wind blasting the corns for   or   miles behind the rock if it fall out in or a little before harvest and this it does likewise in several other places of the country as some gentlemen who knew it to their experience did declare yea so great is the violence of these tempestuous seas that thereby some great stones are cast out and others are worn so that large caves in some places run from the sea within the rock beneath the ground for some considerable way i saw one of these at the east end of the mainland in the parish of holm it is all covered above with the rock and earth save that within these few years some of the rock and earh fell in or was blown up as they ca it in one night by a violent storm blowing from sou east hence now there is a hole in the hill above lik the eye of a coalpit which is terrible to look do into there is another something like this in souronalsha in these caves doves and sea fowls in gre numbers use to nestle  several strange fishes sometimes seen here and little whales etc several strange fishes are here taken or cast ashor sometimes which are they say very beautiful to loo upon but we never had occasion to see any of them there are likewise a great number of little whales which sweem through these isles which they call spoutwhale or pellacks some of which i have seen and they tel us it is dangerous for boats to fall in among them le they be overturned by them the former year anno      there were    of these whales driven ashor upon gairsays land and    upon egleshas about on time as the gentlemen themselves did inform me o which oil is made very benificial to the masters of the ground the ottars also seals or selchs and other such seacreatures are very numerous but now their number is so much diminished that not one o twenty is to be seen and they have found severa of them lying dead upon the shore some hence observing that the judgments of god as to scarcity of suitable provisions to these creatures are upon the waters also  the tides rapid the tides here are so rapid that they will carry  ship alongs with them tho the wind be contrary  not very strong and in going among these isles scarc are they out of one tide when they are engaged in an other and in going from place to place they will find sonetimes the same flood for them and at other times against them and so with the ebb especially there are some impetuous tides which they call rousts caused by the strong current of a tide meeting with a narrow passage the quickness and rapidity of the tide compensing the narrowness of the passage as it is in lanes which tens the blowing wind and makes the wind to w so much the harder in a proportion to the prese it suffers by the straits of the lane so may we on concerning the rousts which run among the isles ave seen some of these rousts boil like unto a seethot with their high white and broken waves and t in a calm summer day when there was no wind wing at one time sailing by the side of lasha roust ween sanda and the calf of eda the roust getting ne hold of us turned about the head of our boat y quickly and tho there were   able young men ing beside the help we had by the sail we could  without great difficulty make our way through it hey tell us that if the greatest ship in britain fell into s roust where it is strongest it would turn her ab at its pleasure and detain her till the tide fell weak n tho she had a right favorable gale these rousts  more dangerous in an ebb then in a flood the ebb ng observed still taeteris paribus to make the foulest t most tempestuous sea and especially they will foam and g if the tide be running in the winds eye and when re is any storm they will cause any ship or boat to stand end and be ready to sink her in the fall several of which usts we had occasion to meet with but the lord ought us safe through  tho the general current of the tide be still the e from west to east in a flood some strange remaks about the tides and from east to est in an ebb yet running with violence upon the and they cause a contrary motion in the sea next to  which they call easter or wester birth according to course and there are some things which have been served as very strange in the running of the tides  that it flows two hours sooner on the west side of nda then it does on the east and at hammoness in e same sle both ebb and flood runns one way expt at the bginning of a quick stream when for   or   ures the flood runs south in north faira the sea ebbs   hours and flows but   but the reasons of  phenomena will not be so intricate or hard to res if we consider the situation of these isles when tide sees to alter his course for the flood co from the west to the west side of sana it t some time before it can get about the point  the isle to the south side thereof so in north  the sea is more open whence the flood comes the ebb runeth through several isles turning m points of land before it come to north faira w cannot but retard its motion so at hammoness sanda the situation of the place much determines running of the tide  the rapid motion of these tides makes sailing dangerous the rapid motion of these tides among the isle and their meeting with one another makes it very dgerous and sometimes more especially in a calm a minister there told us that he was never near death in his life then in a ded calm when night westra for they saw the sea coming which the thought should swallow them up and there being  wind they could not get out of the way but god so dered it in his wise providence that the sea or sw of the sea which they feared broke on the forepa of the boat and so they escaped  there are frequently fnmen seen here upon t coasts finmen frequently seen here as one about a year ago on sonsa and another within these few months on westra a gentleman with many others in the isle looking on him nig to the shore but when any endeavor to apprehen them they flee away most swiftly which is ver strange that one man sitting in his little boat shou come some hundred of leagues from their ow coasts as they reckon finland to be from orkney  may be thought wonderful how they live all the time and are able to keep the sea so long his bo is made of seal skins or some kind of leather  also has a coat of leather upon him and he sitte in the middle of his boat with a little oar in h  fishing

or finlandmen by their ing drive away the fishes from the coasts one er boats is kept as a rarity in the physicians l at edinburgh  on the west side of papa westra some men appearing on a holm before a boat was cast away between it and ra there is an holm wherein once there was a e chapel whereof some of the sidewalls are only w standing in which they say there were seven sis buried who were nuns and desired to ly in this lm about whose graves this chapel was built out a year ago there were seen several times at midy about  0 men walking on that holm among whom there was one higher and greater then the  who sometimes stood and looked unto the chap this my informer with a hundred people in the e of papa saw who could attest the same after which appearance there was a boat cast away on that olm with   men in her who were all lost  in the links of tranaby in westra old burying places and of skeal in the mainland washen from the west by the deucaledonian cean some places are discovered when the sea washh away the sand mr wallaces description of orkney which shows that such places have en cemeteries or burying places for their dead of d of a square figure and the stones are joined toether by some cement when opened earth and someimes bones are found in them the reason some do give of this is because the way of interring dead bodies among many of the ancients as among the saxons n the isle of britain was not in deep graves but under clods or turfs of earth made into hillocks but none of these we had occasion to see concerning that rock called less surrounded with the sea nigh to the nouphead in westra upon which some say if any man go having iron on him the sea will instantly rage so that no boat can come nigh to take him  nor the sea be settled till the piece of iron be cast to it when in westra we enquired about it  found no ground for the truth thereof  a remarkable provibence mr wallace narrates a remarkable providence wh the ministers here confirmed to us as a truth ccerning four men in stronsa who ued to ish togeth in one boat among whom there was one john ne whole wife being desirous he should interit  fishing for a time he having purchassed a great plen of fish which he not being so willing to do on a d she rising before him stopped the windows and o  places in the house whereby light was let in and  went to the fields the other three men after their usual manner went to sea whose boat she saw overturned and themselves perish upon which she returned home to her husband and no doubt would have given the sad news of his neighbors perishing no without joy congratulating that he was not this d in company with them but upon her coming into her house she had yet a more melancholic fight her husband lying dead choked in that vessel wherein they used to make urine  an honest man in orkney told me that some years ago instance of gods mercy when he was coming home with timber and some other things in his bat from innernss and was almost the length of the isle of eda where he lived the boat turned and lay upon her side but the sails being spread in the water hindered the mast to go down and her altogether to overturn much of what they had in went to the sea and he with the other seamen in company sat upon the side of the boat and so were for some hours tossed up and down whither the tide did drive them they in the mean time comforting and refreshing one another with places of scripture and notes of sermons which lately they had heard and sometimes putting up earnest prayers to god whom the wind and seas do obey at length god not turning away his mercy from them nor their prayer from im graciously gave ear unto their cry and rought them all safe ashore together with the boat on he west side of sanda much of the timber and what hey had in being driven ashore to that same very place before them a great mercy when not only they but their boat and most of their loadening were saved ome of these men whom i am acquainted with and o judge godly cannot speak of this deliverance but ith great concernedness and affecion which makes e to think this mercy not to have been a cast of ommon providence but a gracious return of their rayer  the effects of thunder in this country are very urprising    0 the effects of thunderstrange the steeple of kirkwal was brunt with lightening and a    0 there was a genleman in stromness in the west end of the mainland and a stall wherein there were    kine the thunr killed every other one killing one and passing  other so that there were   killed and   alive his the ministers confirmed as a certain truth to their nowledge  there was a man that died not many years ago an eagle takes up a child ho when a child being left in the field the mother as some say shearing at a little distance from im was taken up by an eagle and carried from he parish of orphir in the mainland to the isle of waes ver   or   miles of sea but in gods good proidence the eagle being quickly pursued to his nest hither the child was taken he was recovered without any hurt  it was observed that in these isles before the late earth there were several strange birds seen several strange birds seen such as hey have not seen formerly nor since one of the ministers told me that one bird frequented his house about that time for a quarter of an year which was f a black white red and green color as also he saw another all stripped or sprainged on the back which birds were beautiful to behold  there was a monster about   years ago born of one helen thomson spouse to david martin weaver in north ronalsha a monster born having its neck between head and shoulders a quarter and an half of an yard long with a face nose eyes mouth etc to the back as well as before so that it was two faced which monster came living into the world this the minister declared unto us having taken the attestation of the women present at the birth he not being on the place at the time and it is said that a certain woman should have wished this unto the mother whom she alleged had lied upon her in her wrath wishing that if she spoke a lie she might bring forth a monster which accordingly came to pass in gods holy and will providence  concerning mines shells etc some say there are several mines of silver tin lead etc also some veins of marble and alabaster buchanan commends this country for white and black lead buchan hist l   of which there is to be had as good as in britain sex diversis in locis hujus insula metalla su plumbi albi and nigri tam probi quam usquam in britan reperiatur as also several kinds of fine shells to b found on the shore and rocks but we had occasion t see none of them save some of these nuts where they make snuffboxes  chap v some heathenish and popish rites charm etc yet remaining in the orkneyisles are glanced at concerning their superstitious e before that i bring to a close my discourse concerning orkney i shall give an account of some cstoms yet prevailing among them which can be constructed to be nothing else save the sour dregs of paan and popish superstition and idolatry yea and may of them such as the charms practiced by them o be the mere and woeful effects of pure devilry and ot the product of natures operation  but least i should be mistaken i judge it not amiss o premise a caution given that not all nay nor the generality of orkney re hereby impeached as guilty of these evils for i know there are many judicious and wise men and i hope some real christians among them who abhor and detest such things as much as any but hereby some oolish and silly ones are intended whom deceiving and being deceived satan leads captive at his will nor yet that all the isles are alike lying under the charge for there are some of them whose inhabitants re generally more moral and discreet neither is it lledged that such sinful and corrupt customs prevail as much now as formerly for they are much away y what they were and that even of late nor is t denied but that honest and faithful ministers will abour to have them abolished every where seeing alas there is much horrid wickedness and manifest devilry oo with us in the south as well as with them in the north so that no part of the kingdom can plead not guilty  but my principal scope and design my design in this chap is to manifest he works of darkness and to show how busy the god of this world is in deluding and blinding poor souls and now ready we are to be his drudges and slaves that so these things being wisely and seriously considered all may be induced to make a christian improvement thereof both with respect to themselves and others whom they are called to pity and pray for if peradventure god will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth that they may be recovered out of the snare of the devil and more especially that the general assemblies and other judicatories of this church as they are called may be pleased to continue their fatherly care over these northern isles that tho they be remo from them as to situation yet they may be near unto them as to a warm and kindly affection which o church has not been wanting in hitherto  some things proper to be premised and  st we would take notice that the old maxim ignorance is the mother of devotion so much crye up by the papists and their judicially blinded clergy i so far from being the mother of devotion that it i both the mother and nurse of the most damnable errors superstitions and delusions as these isles kno to their sad experience for ignorance of the principles of our holy religion does greatly prevail among the commonalty so that as one of their ministers no without some concern and grief for the same told me not one of a hundred in some of their parishes can read how this comes to pass that the people should be so grossly ignorant i shall not undertake to determine it is commonly imputed to their want o schools through the country which indeed i will not say but is one great cause thereof and therefore that this so very dreadful an evil may be effectually remedied care should be taken by all concerned that schools be erected in every parish and a competen salary provided for the masters maintenance and encouragement and that also in every isle where there is any number of inhabitants some person should be appointed for the instruction and education of their children and until that such a course be taken the people generally will be ignorant still and the ministers as to the preaching part may complain in the words of the prophet isa      whom shall we teach knowledge and whom shall we make to understand doctrine then that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts for it is much about one to preach to auditors besoted with stupidity and ignorance as it is to give exhortation unto babes therefore it is that our church in her assemblies has so frequently and seriously pressed the learning of children to read and the providing o schools for that end pastors to be diligent in that itiating and necessary work of examination and eaching catechetick doctrine and the concurrence arents with both in laying out themselves for the struction of their children as well by themselves by others godly ministers well knowing that the ccess of ordinances and edification of their people pendeth much thereupon isa      jo     etc as the means which the rd uses to bless for the bringing in of his elect nowledge being so necessary to the being of faith at the latter is sometimes expressed by the name of e former  and seeing they retain not god in their knowledge is no wonder they be given over to a reprobate find to do things which are not convenient gods judgment upon the ignorant no onder they frequent their old chapels for supertious ends of which the corrupt and purblind rean of man has been always very fond no wonder t being in the dark without the lanthorn of the owledge of scripture revelation they mistake their y and by the using of charms and consulting of armers they run to beelzebub in stead of having rese to the god of israel which ignorance to be the use of these evils will appear the more evidently  we consider that in these isles where there is a eater measure of the knowledge of god there is not th a following of these horrid and hellish practices  there are several old chapels in these isles which e people resort unto but that which i heard of as ost famous is st tredwels chapel in papa westra several old chapels through the isles ich they have such a veneration for that they will me from other isles in considerable numbers to it me of us having occassion to be on that isle we saw s chapel situated on a small low rock within a loch mmonly called st tredwels loch st tredwels chapel to which we ssed by steppingstones before this chapel door there s a heap of small stones into which the superstious people when they come do cast a small stone or two for their offering and some will cast in money the chpel has been but little and is now ruinous only so of the walls are standing which the people are so  from suffering to be demolished that they labour keep them up and tho the proprietour of the grou has some way enclosed it yet this proves not effect to prevent the frequenting thereof at the north e side of the loch nigh to the chapel there is a  stone standing behind which there is another stone ing hollowed in the form of a manger and nigh to  there is another high stone standing with a round  through it for what use these stones served  could not learn whether for binding the horses  such to them as came to the chapel and giving the meat in the hollow stone or for tying the sacrific to as some say in times of pagan idolatry is uncert  st tredwels loch held medicinal this st tredwels loch nigh to the east end of whi this chapel is is held by the people as medici whereupon many diseased and infirm persons resort to some saying that thereby they have got good a certain gentlemans sister upon the isle who was  able to go to this loch without help yet return without it as likewise a gentleman in the country who was much distressed with sore eyes went to the loch and washing there became sound and whole  he had been at much pains and expense to cure t formerly with both which persons he who was minister of the place for many years was well acquaied and told us that he saw them both before and al the cure the present minister of westra told me t such as are able to walk use to go so many times ab the loch as they think will perfect the cure bef they make any use of the water and that without speing to any for they believe that if they speak  will mar the cure also he told that on a cer morning not long since he went to this loch  found six so making their circuit whom with s difficulty he obliging to speak said to him they me there for their cure  how it comes to pass that this loch should accomplish the cure of any i leave to my reader to judge how the water of this loch should accomplish the cure of any examined whether it be by any medicinal or healing virtue in the water which i incline not to think the cure being  circumstantiated or if the force and strength of the agination of the persons afflicted may have any tenncy that way which some judge has its own inence in some such like cases or rather by the d and assistance of satan whom god in his holy and se providence may permit so to do for the further dicial blinding and hardening of these who follow ch unwarrantable and unlawful courses god so punishg them by giving them up to such strong delusions et i hear that when they have done all that is usual for them to do as going about the loch washing their bodies or any part thereof leaving something  the loch as old clouts and the like etc it is but few in whom the effect of healing is produced as r this lochs appearing like blood before any disure befall the royal family as some do report we uld find no ground to believe any such thing  these chapels the people frequent these chapels frequented also for prayer and paying of vows as for other ds so for prayer they placing a kind of merit there when performed in such places and this they observe more than private retirements and if they be under any sickness or in any danger as at sea they ill vow so to do and when they go to the chapels  pay the vows taken on they use to lay several tones one above another according to the number  vows which they made some of which heaps we w in st tredwells chapel and none must go empty anded but leave behind them something either a piece of money or of bread or a stone which they judge will be sufficient  as at all times when occasion offers especially in the time of lent they observe these superstitious practices so especially during lent they will not neglect their devotions in such places a on eastersunday several boats will be seen going  them from other isles and though their ministers both privately and publicly have spoken to them yet they cannot get them to forbear and abandon these custom and the minister of southroalsha told us that man of the people in that isle especially such as live at the south end thereof nigh to the kirk called our lady kirk whereof tho now the walls only be standing without a roof yet the very stones thereof they reverence and are not far from adoring and so tencious are they that when in rough weather he has procured the convenience of a barn to preach in ye the people obliged him to come to this ruinous fabric else many of them would not have heard they an now about the putting of a roof on this church which the gentlemen of the isle are not inclined to judging other places more commodious for it to be built in but proposals of this nature do not relish with the people they being so superstitiously wedded to the place of i present situation whereupon the heads of fame will rather by themselves contribute to the repairing of this old church than suffer a new one to be built in any other place of the isle tho less to their cost  in this old fabric of our ladys church there is a stone lying about   foot long concerning a one lying in our ladys church and   foot broad but narrower and round at the two ends upon the surface of which stone there is the print of two feet concerning which the superstitious people have a tradition that st magnus when he could not get a boat on a time to carry him over pightland firth took this stone and setting his feet thereupon passed the firth safely and left the stone in this church which has continued here ever since but as i think and some more judicious people do likewise suggest it has been a stone upon which under popery the delinquents stood bare footed suffering penance it is like when thus st magnus came over the firth it has been that time when he was seen riding through abere giving the first account of the defeat of the english bannockburn and afterward was seen going over pightland firth and indeed both are alike destitute of any adow of truth credible only by these superstitious d silly ones whom the god of this world has inded  several of the isles have their saints days which me do superstitiously observe several of the isles have their saints days there is one day in arvest on which the more ignorant especially in uld say if any work the ridges will blood the ark some call our ladys hen and some such posh dregs are to be found the lord preserve this and from poperys inundation for as it is credible om what has been said and some better acquainted ith this country did inform us that if popery get oting again from the fears of which in the good ovidence of god we were lately deliveredn any  the inhabitants of these isles would readily embrace  and by retaining some of these old popish rites and ustoms seem to be in a manner prepared for it  next to glance at their charms concerning their charms which i shall breif do and not give any account how they perform em left thereby i should seem to point out to any how try the experiment of this hellish art and tremenus devilry which i think i do sufficiently guard ainst not only by barely reciting there are such but  by proper precautions adduced in this chapter  they have a charm whereby they stop excessive ooding in any whatever way they come by it a charm to stop excessive bleeding wheer by or without external violen the name of e patient being sent to the charmer he says over me words which i heard upon which the blood tantly stops tho the blooding patient were at the eatest distance from the charmer yea upon the sayg of these words the blood will stop in the blooding throats of oxen or sheep to the astonishment of speators which account we had from the ministers of e country  another for the toothach there is a charm likewise they make use of for  toothach whereof i had the following instance fr an honest man worthy of credit some years ag there was one who used this charm for the abing the pain of one living in eda tormented therewith and tho the action then was at a distance the chaer not being present with the patient yet according the most exact calculation of the time when the chaer was performed by the charmer there fell a livi worm out of the patients mouth when he was at super this my informer knew to be a truth  the man from whose mouth it fell is yet alive in t isle of sanda whether this worm was generated the corrupted part and so fell out by the devils mean at the using of the charm or the worm was brought by an evil spirit aliunde to the mouth and thence aling down i shall not determine  their beasts and boats sprinkled with forespoken water also when the beasts as oxen sheep horses etc are sick they sprinkle them with a water made  by them which they call forespoken water wherewith likeways they sprinkle their boats when they succee and prosper not in their fishing and especially o halloweven they use to sein or sign their boats an put a cross of tar upon them which my informer ha often seen their houses also some use then to sein  they have a charm also whereby they try if person be in a decay or not and if they will die thereof which they call casting of the heart a charm for any under a decay of this the minister  stronza and eda told us he had a very remarkable passage in a process yet standing in his session records  several other charms several other charms also they have about their marriage when women in travel when their co is calfing when churning their milk or when brewing or when their children are sick by taking the to a smith without premonishing him who has ha a smith to his father and a smith to his grandfather and of several such like charms we had an accou from the ministers as likeways how these charms re performed but of these enough  although these charms sometimes yet not always they produce the desired effects these charms not always effectual as in the instance staying of blood one of the charmers wives fell ce a blooding which he by all his art was not able stop whereupon he is said thus to have expressed self  i have stopped the blooding of  00 and yet i cannot do it to my wife  that such admirable effects upon the using of the harms are produced by the agency of demons acts of assemblies are standing against such as by the assemb    0 hink few if any will doubt god so permitting it  be in his holy and wise providence for the further punishment and judicial blinding of those who low such unlawful courses and the devil thereby engaging his slaves more in his service yet not always the effects desired and exspected do follow at all may know the devil is a chained one and can  nothing without the permission of a sovereign god o is lord over all our assemblies sensible of the eat sin and evil that is in using these charms and nsulting of charmers have made several acts both against the one and the other strictly inhibiting and discharging all such hellish practices and requiring all inisters diligently to see to the observance and execution thereof  evil spirits also called fairies are frequently seen in several of the isles dancing and making merry fairies frequently seen and sometimes seen in armor also i had the account of e wild sentiments of some of the people concerning em but with such i shall not detain my reader we stning our voyage to zetland  chap vi a description of zetland the country in general described the soil product manners of the people etc hinted at situation of zetland zetland lies to the n east from orkney betwixt the  0 and    degree of latitude the being about  0 or    leagues betwixt the sta head of sanda the northernmost point thereof and swburghhead the southern most point of land in zetland over a very rolling and swelling sea wherein the constantly runs the strong current of a tide which causing the sea to rise with its swelling waves the whole passage betwixt orkney and zetland is but  one continued roust or strong and impetuous tide especially about the fair isle still such a great sea goet even in the greatest calm that the boats are like  sling the masts out of them and our boatmaste told us that frequently when he had been passing t fair isle in a dead calm the boat has been so toss by the swelling sea that it would have taken in water on every side and i have heard mariners often declare that there is more hazard in these seas the in going to the eastern or western indies the fa isle of which more afterward is reckoned to b but   leagues from zetland whereas it is about    or    leagues from orkney so that we shall consider it together with the isles belonging to zetland  the isles zetland consists of more isles than orkney whereof some are more others less considerable beside many holms serving for pasturage mainland the largest of em is that which they call the mainland  0 miles ng from south or south and by west to north or orth and by east as to breadth not all alike for o in some places it be    miles yet in other it scarce one mile broad it being so intersected with es sounds or lochs that it may be said to consist  a great number of promontories or branches of and stretching themselves into the sea  all this country consisting of so many isles goes under one common name called by some hethland original of the name zetland  others zetland and also schetland the etymogy of which names is very uncertain as was that of orkney some assigning one reason of the name and others another at their pleasure that which emeth most probable is that this country is called ethland because it is very mountainous and rises igh above the waters so a high land in norse is called hoghland it is called zeland or zetland because of the great sea wherewith on all hands it is encompassed zee being sea in that language and called schetland the fortification schatt or scat in denmark levied an      is a tax with a witness or very great says the modern account of denmark because of a kind of custom or tribute called scat which they paid to their norvegian masters when they were in possession of this country and the tribute or custom imposed upon the inhabitants of norway to this day is called scat and tho zetland be now annexed to the crown of scotland yet there is a certain rent or due which the gentlemen and some others here do pay yearly to the king or his steward which is still called scat i say although we cannot be positive in determining the reasons of the name yet it seems to be of a norvegian or danish original  seeing i have already had under consideration by whom it was first planted and possessed by whom orkney was first planted and inhabited and how it has been disposed of hitherto i judge it not very needful for me to add any more to that purpose concerning zetland for it is more then probable that about the same time by the same persons has zetland also been inhabited seeing there are many mo pi houses remaining there and some of them as outward appearance in better case then are to found in orkney and always our historians in the descriptions of these northern isles of orkney and zland have reckoned them as under the government the same masters therefore without further premise preliminaries of this nature i come to consider the psent state of the country  the country mossey and but thinly inhabited although the country be large yet it is in many places thinly inhabited and that for the most part upon coasts and indeed otherwise it cannot well be there are few if any places in zetland but they are wi in two miles of the sea which they incline to do nigh unto being more convenient for their fish and for the gooding of their land which is ordina by seaware hence it would be incommodious them upon these accounts to be at any distance from besides the country is generally mossey and mountaous all covered over with heath yea the far grest part thereof is as one great moss or quagmire m up of water and earth blended together which k of ground would require much labor and expe to bring in either to be grazing or cornland i all in many places they could get it done for fr scalloway on the west side of the mainland to le on the east side thereof four miles over land it is a continued tract of moss and moor so that the not one house all that way till we come near u lerwick whereas we would think that this piece ground should be better inhabited then many oth considering the great resort of strangers in the sum time thereunto if nature had not laid such inconveniences in the way which would prove so diffic to overcome  the people discreet and fashionable the people are generally discreet and civil no rustic and clounish as would be expected in such place of the world which may be much owing eir converse and commerce with strangers who pair to these isles in the summer season with whom e inhabitants do keep a constant bartering or trade which trading as it makes them the better to live so may tend not a little to the cultivating of their mans they are also very fashionable in their clothes d the gentry want not their fine stuffs such as hold hamburgh etc do afford so that they are to be seen as good an order and dress as with us in the south he bowrs fishers and other country people also do  honestlike and decent in their apparel as becomes eir station  they also have always been in repute for hospitality hospitable d indeed we have seen no other to contradict that which is spoken so much to their commendation and aise for at any time when we had occasion to visit entlemen merchants or others we were always by em kindly entertained and so much they are said  be given to this commendable piece of humanity at if they do purchase any thing from foreign merants which they put any value upon such as wheatead some strong liquor etc even the country people will not use it themselves but reserve it for the tertainment of strangers as for those old inhatants of the danish blood of whom it was said that  were seeming fair but really false and superlatively oud they are much worn out of this country and  at any time ships be driven ashore upon their coasts  inhabitants use very kindly and humanely to treat  distressed company of which humane treatment  ship belonging to the firth had a late experience ing broke on the coast there in december last as e of the ships company informed me such a kind d generous reception merchants and mariners meet t with in many places upon which they are unhapily cast from whom better things would be expected the body of the people ignorant to the matters of god and religion the body of  people are said to be very ignorant by these who know them better then we can be supposed to have ha access to do considering the short time of our stay and abode among them which may be imputed to their want of convenient schools for the instruction o their youth in many places of the country which also was assigned as the reason why gnorance does s much prevail in the orkney isles which great evil the mother and leader of many others all should labor to redress as they are several called and concerned authority also interposeing their command and not denying their countenance and encouragement thereunto  yet frequent gospel ordinances yet we must say that the people do frequent the dispensing of gospel ordinances and seem to hear with some measure of attention and reverence and as appeared to us not without some seriousness and concern upon their spirits which after hearing continued with some as we found by our converse with them which encouraged us to set and keep up two week days sermons at lerwick during our stay in the bounds which the people thronged unto thereby showing great respect to the ordinances dispensed by us s that matters looked far otherwise then what was expected by our selves and many others before we cam to this country and indeed after conference upon this head all of us judged that if things were got pu into a better order and some evils removed which forbear to mention knowing that they will come under the cognizance and consideration of others wh are in a capacity to redress them there might be harvest through grace  no latin school there although there be a latin school at kirkwal in orkney yet there is none in all this country which cannot but be very prejudicial to the inhabitants the advancement of the education of their youth being the eb hindered many promising and pregnant ingenys los and letters discouraged for gentlemen are either obliged to keep their children at home and so the must want that piece of learning which tends so much to form and folish their minds and to complete them as gentlemen or else send them to other countries where education is to be had which many are averse to do not only because of the charge and expense they will be at but also of the fear they will be in in sending their children over sea and keeping them so long at such a distance from them as for chaplains tho they could be had which would be with difficulty in this corner yet all gentlemen who have children to educate cannot well bear the charges of bringing them over from scotland and keeping them with them for so long a time whereupon the ministers there are very desirous that the government may be addressed for encouragment to schoolmasters through the country and particularly that a latin school be set up either at lerwick or stalloway  english is the common language among them yet many of the people speak norse or corrupt danish their language especially such as live in the more northern isles yea so ordinary it is in some places that it is the first language their children speak several here also speak good dutch even servants though they never have been out of the country because of the many dutch ships which do frequent their ports and there are some who have something of all these three languages english dutch and norse the norse has continued ever since the norvegians had these isles in possession and in orkney as has been said it is not quite extinct tho there be by far more of it in zetland which many do commonly use  it is observable that the names of the descendants of the old inhabitants names differ from the names of others now numerous among them for these only have a name without a surname save what is taken from their fathers name and by adding son or daughter thereunto exemp gra agnes magnus daughter her own name is agnes her fathers is magnus to which daughter is added which is the whole denomination or designation under which such a woman goes so mrion peters daughter laurence johns son etc which they say is yet the danish way of expressing and distinguishing names and for further clearing if ther be two men or women of the same name they u also to design them by the places where they ordinarily reside as agnes magnus daughter in trebister that so she may be discriminated from another woman of the same name living in another place it is probable that hence flowed these sirnames such as williamson robertson jamieson davidson etc which d abound with us in scotland in some words also their pronunciation does differ from that of ours as for instance they often use to leave out the letter h in the pronunciation as if it did not belong to the word s three they pronounce as tree thou as tou or tu etc they have also some norish words which they commonly use which we understood not till they were explained such as air which signifies a sand bank oyse an inlet of the sea voe a creek or bay etc and these words are much used both in zetland and orkney  the country better inhabited then formerly it would appear that the country is now much better inhabited than formerly some ages ago it has been for we hear but of few who leave this country having once fixed their abode therein tho there be many who have lately come to it from orkney caithness sutherland buchan and other places especially in the north of scotland so that in all lerwick the most considerable town in the country there are but very few whose grandfathers have lived in those isles and in lerwick it self about  0 years ago there were only   houses and some years before there were none at all tho now there are between two and three hundred families in it people healthful and many live to a good age   tho the ground be generally bad and the climate cold yet it is not unwholesome living here as appears from the many vigorous old people that abound in the sles whose health i think is rather more firm and ound then with us neither are they liable to such freuent sickness whither this is to be imputed to the eeness and purity of the air or to the quality of their diet or the sobriety of their living or to all these and the like i shall not judge yet they tell us they used o live much longer in former ages then now they do as of one airvile who lived   0 years and all his time never drank beer or ale his son also and grandchildren lived to a good old age who seldom or never drank any other thing save milk water and their countrybland it is said also that this tairvils father lived longer then himself there was also one laurentius in the parish of waes whose heir oyes do yet live there who arrived at a great age whom buchanan mentions that he lived in his time marrying a wife after the  00 year of his age and in the   0 went a fishing with his little boat when the sea was tempestuous salubritatis firmitudo in laurentio quodam nostra atate apparuit qui post centisimum annum uxotum duxit centesimum quadragesimum annum agens buchan hist l  savissimo mari in sua navicula piscatum prodibat ac nuper nulla vi gravioris morbi labefactatus sed sento solutus decessit for surely as all skilful physicians do grant there is nothing more conducive to the maintaining of a sound and healthful constitution then a sober and regular diet whereas they who live otherwise to speak with respect to  d causes do impair their health and cuts themselves off often in the midst of their days especially such as feed high and indulge themselves in drinking strong liquors which tends to the exhausting of that natural and innate heat the fountain of our animallife whereas it is observed of all these who arrived at such a great age that they seldom if ever drank any strong liquor  they obnoxious to the scurvy there is no sickness or disease this country i more subject unto then the scurvey as is orkney likewise which is occasioned doubtless by their saltmeats fishes upon which many for the most part do live seaair etc and sometimes this scurvey degenerates into a kind of leprosy which they call a bastard scurvey and is discerned by hairs falling from the eyebree the nose falling in etc which when the people come to know they separate and set them apart for fear of infection building huts or little houses for them in the field i saw the ruins of one of these houses about half a mile from lerwick where a woman was for some years kept for this reason this bastard leprosy they judge is caused by the many gray fishes such as sillucks piltocks etc which they eat for bread failing many of the people in the summer time that often for   or   months they will not taste thereof these fishes are almost their only meat and especially the livers of these fishes which are thought to be more unhealthful then the fishes themselves and they much incline to eat do occasion this the drinking also of hot bland which is a kind of a serum of milk of which more afterward together with these fishes do beget such corrupt humors to the distempering of the body these scorbutic persons are more ordinarily in dunrossness and delton and more rare in other places and that because they have mo gray fishes in these two parishes then in others  and it has been observed often by the inhabitants that when in holy providence any sickness comes upon or breaks up in the country when any sickness breaks up in the country it quickly spreads small pox lately there it uses to go through them like a plague so that since we came of the small pox has seized upon many both old and young and was so universal that upon one lords day there were  0 prayed for in the church of lewick all sick of the same disease whereas when we were there a few weeks before there was not one that we knew sick thereof they say a gentleman son in the country who had lately gone from the uth and was under it when he came home brought with him which very quickly spread among the people the old as well as the young and so sad have en the desolating effects thereof that one told me ho arrived here lately from the place that he verily dgeth the third part of the people in many of the es are dead thereof  although many of the inhabitants have each their particular trades and employments wherein more espeally they lay out themselves and are taken up about their employment et are they all generally some way acquainted with e sea and can with some dexterity and skill attained  experience manage their boats not only because of eir frequent passing from isle to isle and going over the oes or lochs which ly in upon and cut the mainland it by reason of their great fishing not only for their n use but for the use of merchants who buy their ishes or give them the value in foreign commodies hence most of the inhabitants not only have some asturage for their cattle and some corn land about eir houses which they manure but also their parts  boats for the end forsaid yet there are many who llow no trade but their fishing  beside their fishtrade with foreign merchants they trade with orkney they o likewise drive a great trade with orkney from which very year several boats do pass to zetland laden with corns meal malt etc upon the coming whereof they ften wait for barley seed tho the last year they had considerable crop so that the barley seed was sown before the boats came over the orkney men also bring sometimes stockins ale and the like which they know  be vendible here hence every year considerable ums of money go from zetland to orkney and some ave told me that most of the money they have in orkney is from zetland so great is the advantage that these isles do reap by their neighbourly commerce with one another for as zetland could not well live without orkneys corns so neither could orkney b well without zetlands money  their money from foreign merchants as orkney have much of their money from zetla so zetland have all theirs from foreign nations countries whose merchants traffic with them as f holland hamburgh beme etc the dutch mo does ordinarily pass among them as stivers half sers and since the rates of the money were raise scotland many here have been considerable gainers the ducketdouns which is the species of money  the hollanders bring more ordinarily with them  the kings rents the kings rents are but the  d part of what t are in orkney the bishop had no rents from this country for tho this country be by far gre and more spacious then orkney yet it is not so well in bited neither is the ground so good these rents paid to the taxmen in butter oil and money t oil is made of the livers of fishes and is sent so for the making of soap or is otherwise disposed of may be most advantageous the bishops had no re from this country and tho it belong to the dio of orkney and is a considerable part of that charge we did not hear that ever any of these sole pastor their diocesses as some are pleased to call them visi these bounds  little cornland here there being so little cornland here is the ca why none of the revenues of the croun are paid meal or corns whereas in orkney it is far otherwi as has been said for any cornland they have is ordinarily but a few ridges nigh to the coasts for any distance from the sea and in many places a nigh unto it there is nothing but a mossy and motainous desert covered with heather and only so places plenished with a few kine sheep or shelt tho in other places ye will go some miles and see no this moss and moor which so much abounds rders traveling very dangerous even to the nati themselves and so deep is it in many places and t in the summer and droughty season that horses c t pass it and men on foot not without difficulty and zard as in the isle of yell the minister in going to the church from his house is obliged to go on foot   iles almost wading up to the knees and indeed the siest and safest way of traveling is by sea in boats out the skirts of the isles which also is not without nger  and tho the greatest part of this country be thus ossy and moorish some pleasant spots through the country yet there are some pleasant spots  it well furnished with grass and corn as nigh to alloway vstness etc in the mainland some places in e parishes of dunrosness also on the main in the fle f unst etc hence some years they will have  0 fold  increase but this is more rare for at other times in veral places they will scarce have the double of their ed they make much use of barlybread which ppears to be fairer then their oatbread for their rly they take to be the best grain it agreeing betr with the ground then oats and as it is in orkney so is it here if any white corn be brought unto e country for seed it will soon degenerate and beme like their oun  i think the kine and sheep are of a greater size concerning their cattle and harvest en they are in orkney tho their horses be of a less  for the sheep i take them to be little less then they e in many places of scotland they lamb not so soon s with us for at the end of may their lambs are ot come in season their harvest also is much latter r they judge it very early if they get their corns in against the middle of october they observe that our easons will be two months before theirs but i do ot think they differ so much  if their sheep were well kept their sheep it would be very easant to behold them in flocks they being of diers colors some of a pyed others of a broun others f a broun and white others of a black color some so have black spraings on their backs others on their reheads and some say they have as great a number of black sheep as they have of white which diversity colors would render them very beautiful if they we taken a due care of for they neither wash nor c their sheep nor have they any shears for that end b pulls the wool off them with their hands which as is painful to the beasts so it makes them look not well favored but like these with us whose w is scratched with briars or thorns  their ordinary drink their ordinary drink is milk or water or milk a water together or a drink which they call bland m common in the country tho not thought to be ve wholesome which so they make up having take away the butter from their churned milk as likewi the thicker parts of this milk which remains after t butter is taken out they then pour in some hot wter upon the serum whey or the thinner part of t milk in a proportion to the milk which being do they make use of it for their drink keeping some f their winter provision and this drink is so ordina with them that there are many people in the country who never saw ale or beer all their lifetim the ale is rare among them they making bread much of their barley grain but the hamburgh be both small and strong is to be had in plenty tho at good rate   sh or   sh our pint which beer and oth liquors as also wheat bread the hamburghers bring wi them in the month of may for sale hence sometim liquors as beer ale etc cannot be had for money  the hamburghers bring it  victuals earer then in orkney the great confluence of strangers makes kine shee hens and almost all victuals to sell at a greater rat then in orkney for often when the bushes are her they will give double or triple for a sheep or a he then it is to be bought in orkney for for the holland with their bushes being numerous on these coast they send sometimes a shore to buy fresh meats whi if to be had they will not want for the price  fowls in plenty they have fowls especially seafowls in great pley which do frequent the rocks holms etc which they take as they do in orkney and are very beneficial o the proprietours there are also many eagles which do great prejudice and hurt to the country for the lambs they will lift up in their claws and take whole to their nests and falling down upon the sheep they fix one foot on the ground and the other on the sheeps back which they having so apprehended they  st pick but their eyes and then use the carcases as they please all sorts of duck and drake dunte geese cleckgeese embergeese etc they have as in orkney  they have many crows but neither here nor in orkney are they of that color which they are of with us crows or their head wings and tail only are black but their back and breast from the neck to the tail are of a gray color and the country people look upon it as a bad omen when black crows come to these isles they portending that a famine will shortly ensue  there are many conies in some places but no hares many rabbets no mair fowls or hares few rats no frogs or venomous creatures neither are there any moorfowls which are numerous in orkney some say that a few from orkney have been brought over for trial but they could not live here no poddocks or froggs are to be seen tho many in orkney neither are there any rats to be found except in some isles and these are greater then ordinary and thought to come out of ships when riding at anchor nigh to the shore but they have mice in abundance neither are there any venomous creatures in these isles they have many ottars one of which was so tamed that it frequently used to bring fishes out of the sea to a gentlemans house in haskashie as one told me who knew the truth thereof  they have a sort of little horses called shelties concerning their horses called shelties then which no other are to be had if not brought hither from other places they are of a less size then the orkney horses for some will be but   others  0 nives or handbreadths high and they will be thought big horses there if eleven and although so small yet are they full of vigor and life and some not so high as others often prove to be the strongest yea there are some  whom an able man can lift up in his arms yet will they carry him and a woman behind him   miles forward and as many back summer or winter they never come into an house but run upon the mountains in some places in flocks and if at any time in winter the storm be so great that they are straightened for food they will come down from the hills when the ebb is in the sea and eat the seaware as likewise do the sheep which winter storm and scarcity of fodder puts them out of case and brings them so very low that they recover not their strength till about st johns massday the   th of june when they are at their best they will live till a considerable age as       or  0 years and they will be good riding horses in    especially they will be the more vigorous and live the longer if they be   years old before they be put to work these of a black color are judged to be the most durable and the pyeds often prove not so good they have been more numerous then now they are the best of them are to be had in sanston and eston also they are good in waes and yell these of the least size are in the northern isles of yell and vnst  the coldness of the air the barrenness of the mountains on which they feed and their hard usage may occasion them to keep so little for if bigger horses be brought into the country their kind within a little time will degenerate and indeed in the present case we may see the wisdom of providence for their way being deep and mossie in many places these lighter horses come through when the greater and heavier would sink down and they leap over ditches very nimbly yea up and down rugged mossy braes or hillocks with heavy riders upon them which i could not look upon but with admiration yea i have seen them climb up braes upon their knees when otherwise they could not get the height overcome so that our horses would be but little if at all servicable there  the great fishing which they have upon the coasts their fishes numerous makes the place desirable to the natives and to be frequented by strangers it excelling any other place of the king of brittans dominions for herring white and gray fishing the white fishing they call the killin and ling etc their gray the silluks and seths there are also sometimes very strange fishes here to be found as about    years ago there came a great number of small thick fishes into a voe on the south side of neston they were of a golden color very pleasant to behold they were about the bigness of an ordinary trout and all of an equal size they being very numerous the country made much use of them who judged them very savoury tasting like a turhot and never before or since that time were these fishes seen in these seas as my informer an old gentleman could remember their tusk is a rare fish but more ordinary with them of which more when we come to speak of their fishing also many rare shells are to be found on the coasts but we had not time to enquire and look after them  through the isles for fuel they have good pites in abundance tho fuel in some places they are at a distance from them as these who live in the skerries are obliged to bring them from other isles as from whalsey and the passage being dangerous many boats are cast away with them some also living in dunrossness are at a loss this way they not having the moss at hand as generally they have in other places on the main much broken timber also is driven ashore upon these isles so that the inhabitants of the skerries trust the one half of their provision to this driven timber and broken ships in great quantity often cast ashore partly through the many ships that spleet on these isles and partly as the wrack of ships cast away at some distance which is brought here by the ebb from norway or other place lying to the east of zetland  no trees there are no trees in this country more then orkney we saw some old white and weather bear stocks standing in scalloway for whatever reasons man be alleged for trees not growing in orkney far more  i judge they will hold in zetland both with respect  the air and to the soil there are also at scatroway son goose and rizzerberrie bushes which use every yea to be laden with fruit which are a great rarity in the place of the world  many excelent herbs scurvey grass in abundance many excellent herbs are found growing here the little knoun or made use of a certain english physician and skilled botanist who was at lerwick some year ago told our host that there were many choice an rae herbs here not to be found in england they have much scurveygrass god so ordering it in his wi providence that juxta venenum nascitur antidotum that seeing the scurvy is the common disease of the country they should have the remedy at hand  much limestone there is here much limestone tho for ought heard not to be found in orkney which in some place they have but lately come to the knowledge of as i unst but about   years since and in other places they know not yet how to use it the parish of tngw they say consists almost of limestone they having few if any other stones then such  stones for building broad the stones wherewith they build are generally broad and like flagstones by reason of which figure and shape the stones lying the more easily the builder are at less trouble in fitting them for the wall and have observed that in some houses there is little lime clay or any such thing for cementing of the building which renders their dwelling so much the colder the peircing air passing through between the chinks of the stones which they have no need of under this cold and airish climate but some of these houses they man designedly so build that the wind may have free passage through them for drying of their fishes which ouses some cal keas  there are several superstitious customs and practis which the more ignorant people follow several superstition customs some of which we will have occasion to note in the sequel of is discourse but not so many did we hear of as there e in orkney but i hope the vigilance and diligence  our church in inspecting these isles and putting all  their duty will prove a blessed mean in the hand  god for the eradicating and utter abolishing of these elicts of paganism and idolatry  sailing about these coasts is often very dangerous sailing dangerous hence the waters prove graves to many of the inhatants while we were there in the month of may a at was cast away going by the shore to dunressness d a man and his sister therein perished and another an in her was saved by getting upon the keel of the at and sometimes boats are cast away when not one ved about the isles are many blind rocks which the atives sometimes unhappily fall and break upon eitheir through a mistake or the tide and wind driving them upon them at other times the wind rising seth the sea so to swell that the waves breaking upon eir small boats are ready to overset them and sometimes do also tho the wind be not so strong there will me flanns and blasts off the land as to their swiftess and surprisal something like to hurricanes which ting with a great impetus or force upon their sails verturns the boat and in a moment hurries them into ternity by such a flan the lad of muna a gentleman in this country is said to have perished the forther year      when within sight of his ou house and all that were in the boat with him said to be    0 persons save one servant who escaped upon the eel i remember that night we came to the land of zetland our seamen thought fit in their prudence not to sail too nigh the land for fear of such flans o to be as watchmen on our towers looking out a waiting for the lords coming  little commerce in the winter for this cause it is that during the winter sea they have ordinarily converse or commerce wi none except that ships be driven in by stress of wther for the open boats dare not come and the clo decked not without danger the sea commonly at the time being so tempestuous the tides and rousts rapid that they threaten all who come near them w being swallowed up therefore it is as they tell u that from october till april or may they ordinar see no strangers nor know any news which makes t winter so much the longer and wearisome unto them an instance whereof we had that the late revolution when his highness the prince of orange our present king was pleased to come over to assert our liberties a deliver us from our fears falling out in the winter it was may thereafter before they heard any thing of  and that  st they say from a fisherman whom some would have had arraigned before them and impeach of high treason because of his news as some did  form us  they sometimes infested by pirates their country lying very open and in many pces but thinly inhabited exposes them to the host incursions of pirates in a time of war as of late the frenches did much infest their coasts some of their m landing did by shot kill their kine and sheep and take them away with them yea sometimes they spare not the churches but sacrilegiously robbed them puling down the timber thereof as seats etc and taking them for burnwood so they did to a church in nor mevan but they never came into brassa sound le they had been locked up within land winds turning contrary  some light all the night over in june in the month of june they have a clear light all t night over for at the darkest hour thereof you w see clearly to read a letter the sun sets between  0 and    at night and rises between   and   e morning but for this they have so much the shorr day and longer night in the winter  chap vii a particular vien is given of the several parishes and most considerable isles in zetland thus far having considered the state of the country in general a brief description of the several parishes with the isles thereunto belonging we come next to take some parcular view of the isles which that i may the better and ore methodically do i shall lay before my reader e several parishes with some brief description of the principal isles thereunto belonging for as to the numer of the isles i never heard an exact account given ereof there being many of them small wherein is ly a family or two and so but little noticed  the  st parish of dunrossness is the parish of dunrossness on the mainland to the south and is the parish which lies next to okey and scotland wherein are   churches in which eir minister performs divine service crosskirk nwich and fair isle in this parish are several very ood voes or harbors commodious for ships to ride  in this there is also much cornland there ground aring the richest grain in many places not so mossy d covered over with heath as other parishes are which makes them to have less fuel tho more corn much of the land here is sanded and the sea almost early gains something on the lower parts thereof e land lying so low and sandy in many places is onvenient for conics which abound here about the es or southern most point of land in this parish there is a great fishing this southermost point has two heads swinburgh head and fitwalls head swinburgh and fitwalshead two high ocks seen by mariners coming from the south at a great distance which when discovered they direct their course toward them  st ninians isle to the northwest of the ness lies st ninians isl very pleasant wherein there is a chapel and ane alt in it where on some superstitious people do burn canles to this day some take this isle rather to be a ki of peninsula joined to the main by a bank of san by which in an ebb people may go into the isle t sometimes not without danger  the fair isle the fair isle belongs to this parish lying leagues or    miles to the south or south and by e of swinburgh head by burhannan it is called insuab the pleasant or pretty isle tho i do judge fair m be as well taken roperly as appellatively for the  faira or fara there being another isle lying to t north of this which they call north faira which rela to another faira by south now there is no sle lying the south of this north faira which has any nat that can be interpreted faira but this fair isle mo over i neither did see nor was i informed of any thin that afford us any reason why this isle should be appellatively taken and denominated bella or fa this fair isle rises high above the waters and is se by mariners at a great distance it i about an mile a a half long from south to north and nigh to a m in breadth the side thereof toward the west is a continued ragged rock from one end to another alwa beat upon by the impetuous currents of a swelling se above this west side is the craig which they call t sheepcraig whereon there are no houses nor co land but sheep use to feed the side lying to t east is lower declining toward the sea there are it two harbors one upon the northernend looki to zetland and another toward the southern poi but ships or boats do not ordinarily resort thereunt if not put to it inhbitants and some cornland and pasture in fair isle and better cannot do for so it ha been a safe shelter and refuge to many  there use to be about  0 or    families in it b now they say death has almost depopulate the isl the small pox having lately raged there and swe away two thirds of the inhabitants so that there is not  sufficient number spared to manage their fishboats that gentlemans son abovementioned having touhed here in his way to zetland they have good paturage for sheep and kine and some cornland and e very hospital and kind their minister uses to isite them once in the year in the summer time and aving with them about a month preaching baptizng their children and doing other parts of his astoral work after which he returning to zetland they re without public ordinances till the next years revolution  the hawks they say good hawks there which are to be had in the fair isle are the best in britain which use to flee to zetland or orkney for their prey these being the nearest lands and sometimes they will find moor fowls in their nests which they behoved to bring from orkey seeing there are none in zetland and the nearest isle they could have them in was stronza or westra which is between  0 and  0 miles of sea over which at one flight they must carry these fowls to their nests  many ships use to cruise about this fair isle in the summer time ships use cruse thereabout and by it the hollands fleet going to or coming from the east indies use to pass tho sometimes as in the late wars they sailed by the north of zetland that they might be more free of danger ships also going to or coming from norway or the east sea frequently pass this way when wind serves them so to do and this fair isle being seen by them at    or    leagues distance in a clear day it is as a myth or mark for directing their courses  the  d parish of tingwal is the parish of tingwall lying on the east of the main to the north of dunrossness wherein are   churches tingwall whiteness wisedale and lerwick but the minister uses not to preach by turns at lerwick as he does at his other   churches he not finding himself obliged so to do it being but built lately at the expense of the inhabitants however somtimes he has sermon there and baptizeth the children lerwick in this parish is now become t principal town in the country lying on the east  the main at brassa sound over against the isle  brass  town of lerwick lerwick is more then half a mile in length lyin south and north upon the side of the sound and w consist of between   and  00 families it is but within these few years that it has arrived to such a numbe of houses and inhabitants it is become so considerable because of the many ships which do yearly frequent the sound whereby merchants and tradesme are encouraged to come and dwell in this place an not for the pleasantness of its situation or the fertilit of the country about for it is built upon a rock piece of ground wherein they can have no street bu a kind of a narrow passage before their doors betwix them and the sound which in some places will not admit of two mens going in a breast and at the back o the town there is a hill of black moss wherein they cast their pites which in some places comes to their very doors and no cornland is there about it save a little within the castle for near a mile of way  many of their houses are very commodious to dwell in most of them being two stories high and well furnished within their inhabitants consist of merchants tradesmen and fishers who keep up a good trade with foreigners from whom they buy much of their domestic provision some of them are persons of a considerable stock which they have many ways to improve for their advantage they are very civil and kind of an obliging temper which we had the experience of during our abode among them there are but few begging poor to be seen here or in any place of the country where we had occasion to be there being a great store of small fishes for the supply of their necessity  they have upon their own charges built a convenient church at the back of the middle of the town a church built in lerwick but no ministr settled there and furnished it with good seats high and low they re at present a part of the parish of tingwal but very esireous to be disjoined and erected into a parish by themselves that so they may enjoy a minister of their own for the promoting of which good work they are most willing according to their ability to contriute for the settling of a fond for a stipend to a minister but not being in a capacity to give all they esolved to make application to the government for to have some allowance out of the revenues of the bishopric of orkney or otherwise as the wisdom of the government should see meet that so there may be a competency made up  upon their application to us fit this town be erected into a parish we judgeing it most convenient yea necessary that this town with some of the adjacent country should be erected into a paroch cherished this their pious design telling them that we intended to recommend it to the commission of the general assembly that they may interpose with the lords and other honorable members of the respective judicatories before whom this affair shall come for the better effectuating the same for the town it self is considerable and the principal one in the country much frequented by the gentry as also by strangers in the summer time and their minister preaching seldom here they are ordinarily destitute of gospel ordinances the people scarce being able in the summer season and all most impossible for them in the winter to travel to the next church where their minister preaches it being about   miles distance from them of exceeding bad way as we knew when we did perambulate the bounds which want of ordinances makes their case very sad and deplorable it nurseth ignorance occasioneth much sin especially horrid profanation of the lords day by strangers as well as by inhabitants and does effectally obstruct the conversion of souls preaching of t word being a special mean of convincing and coverting sinners and building them up in holine and comfort through faith unto salvation  citidale of lerwick at the north end of the town is the castle or cidel of lerwick begun to be built in the time of t dutch war anno      by workmen sent by autho from scotland for that end but the work was new perfected the work men returning home anno      that time also  00 soldiers were sent over fort defense of the country against the hostile incuons of the hollanders and were quartered in pla nigh to the fort who likewise returned home a out the same time with the wokmen the garson could do much to command the sound for the there was no town here so that none durst la nigh unto them the walls are yet in a good contion high in some places without but filled up wi earth within whereon they raised their cannon the weakest part of the wall toward the north the has been a sallyport dangerous to attack by reas of a deep ditch before it fed by a spring into whi the garrison by cunning artifices might endeavor draw the enemy who by the stratagems of war the being brought on and ensnared did incontinent sink down into the sound below them at the foot the hill whereupon the castle is situated with the walls is a house of guard which has been t stories high burnt by the dutch after that o soldiers had left the fort upon the walls towar the sound are standing   iron cannons one a   another a   and a  d a  0 pounder not left by the who kept garrison but since that time within the  0 years taken out of the sea nigh to wnalsey a she of force there being cast away about  0 years before which guns the inhabitants of lerwick late mounted upon the walls of the castle whereby the might be in a capacity to defend themselves against the th privateers who at any time should come up the and and assault them  between lerwick and the isle of brass on the east with a pleasant bay or sound brassasound commonly called brassa sound famous for s being so safe a road for ships anchor and ride in and that in the greatest storm ng enclosed with land on every side except the try thereunto from the south which is half a mile ad but within the sound as at lerwick its a mile has another narrow passage at the north end of  but dangerous to go out or in at because of some and rocks therein this sound is the ordinary place which the holland bushes do resort in time of ring fishing who before they put out their nets which must not be according to a law they have among themselves before the   th june use to come re and put themselves ships and nets in order d the time by them appointed being come they all  to sea together fishing near to this land somees there have been seen in the sound  000 or   00 d at once and every year some hundreds as      00 yea sometimes so thick do the ships y in  sound that they say men might go from one side  the sound to the other stepping from ship to ship d during their fishing they will come in to the and for fresh water or other necessary provision and return to sea again  to this parish of tingwal also belongs scalloway scalloway ng on the west

at the building of this house his hand lay very hea on the poor people by causing them in great numbe to be employed about the building which could not b divert them from their ordinary work as fishing and whereby they provided sustinance for themselves    families after this one mr pitcawn minister northmevan said to be a godly and zealous man coming to pay his respects to the earl the earl dsired him to compose a verse which he might p upon the frontis piece of his house from this the mnister took occasion to lay before the earl his great s of oppression upon which the earls anger was incesed and in his rage he threatened him with imprisoment however the earl afterward coming to so composure of spirit mr pitcawn said unto hi well if you will have a verse i shall give you o from express words of holy scripture luke   whi verse the earl being pleased with caused inscribe on the lintle above the gate with luke   added the verse the minister thereby insinuating that t house could not stand long having such a san foundation as oppression as indeed neither did it  shortly after the earl being beheaded the house was t taken care of and is now become ruinous  and herein the wise providence of god may be obrved observe thereupon that as the inscription on the gate of the ace of birsa in orkny did hold forth the ambition of e father so this inscription on the gate of the e of scalloway in zetland did show the oppression of  son and tho it be many years since the death of m both yet the very houses built by them to take their honor and grandour to appear do yet and to their dishonor and infamy and in a manner  bear witness against them so truly verified in em is that scripture psalm      and  0 psalm      pro  0  that tho the inward thoughts of a  be that their

the several pahes within the bounds of the isles and country of land and hinted at if not all principal isles yet the greatest part  the isles the principal whereof are unst yell fetlor ssa and burra  whence we see there is no minister here but has least   churches ministers exposed to much trouble and danger wherein he dispenses gospel dinances and some of them have   and others   me of which churches are at a great distance from e another to travel to which is not only toilsome and ngerous to the respective ministers they also not ving little manses or houses for their accommodation en they come to many of them tho often when rms do arise they will be detained in the isles for e time until they lessen not only i say is this ublesome to the ministers but highly prejudicial to  people among whom the work of the gospel is atly thereby retarded as we had occasion likewise ote concerning orkney few of the people using to air to other churches when there is not public orship at their own which at most will be but one of  sabbaths and in many places but one in three or r and in some not to be had for some months ich as undoubtedly it occasioneth great ignorance many gross scandals as adulteries fornications etc e faithful preaching of the gospel doing much if  to convince and convert yet to moralize a people  put a restraint to these horrid enormities  and tho the difficulty would not be small there could be some more parishes here if at all could be got done to have ministers constantly to ach in the several chuches even in the most consiable isles yet there might be some more ministers here than there are   or   at least to whom the tith if rightly employed could afford a sufficient maintaiance as one minister more in the parish of dunrossne on the main and another in the isle of yell etc whi charges at present are very great and cannot well  served by the ministers they have the tithes a farmed to viccars a kind of inferior tacksmen w in some places do not only oppress the people but a uneasy to the ministers not paying them what the are obliged to pay till they please which often the will not do for some years the ministers sufferi by this piece of injustice laid it before the commission one of their greivances which they craved might  redressed and for that end application might be man to the government  chap viii an account of the ancient monuments curisities strange providence etc most obserable in the isles of zetland the works of creation and providence are all ry wonderful observable things in zetland sought out of them who have plsure therein among which some more ordinarily oc and are the subject of our meditation and others no commonly presenting themselves are the more surprisi and amusing both which are to be had a due rega unto they being either mediatly or immediately by without  d causes the work of the lord and operation of his hands and seeing there are s things that deserve their own observation which eit i had occasion to see or to hear of in zetland i  give a brief relation thereof not denying but t there may be other things no less if not more observa there which we came not to the knowledge of  the picts houses which are frequent through this ountrey concerning the picts houses the inhabitants take much notice of as beg the ancientest monuments they have some of which e more others less ruinous they are round in the m of some dovecoats or something like un an egg bulging out in the middle but narrower at e bottom and yet more narrow at the top they ave a little door for an entry at which a man of an rdinary stature could not enter without bowing with which door there is a stair going up between two one walls leading to the several apartments instead  windows they have slits or long narrow holes in e wall such as are in many of our old castles for the onveyance of light unto them they are strongly built t the convenience for dwelling has been but little or their diameter is but about  0 or    foot and their eight scarce  0 or    i think these picts houses are much like arthurs oven upon the water of carron in rlingshire  these have been the domiciles or dwellings of the icts observe thereupon the old if not the first inhabitants of this couney who were very numerous in the north of scotland ed in orkney having their own kings as has been id in our description of orkney they are convenienty situated through the isles each one being within the ight of another hence in a few hours advertisement could e given by fire or other signs they might condescend upon through the whole country signifying unto them any danger that being thereby alarmed they might meet together or be upon their own defense these houses are also called burgh which in the old tutonick or saxon language rich verstegan in his antiquities of the english nation and their saxon kings signifies a town having a wall or some kind of an enclosure about it as also a castle for as one observes in his dictionary or explanation of our most ancient english words all places that in old time had among our ancestors the name of borough bury or burug were places one way or other fenced and fortifyed whence it appears that these houses have been castles or places of defense to the pic seeing it is generally acknowledged that both the pic and the saxons were originally descended of the sa german nation and so might call their castles by t same name i have also heard it observed that in orkn several places wherein they used of old to bury the dead were called burghs so likewise these houses  zetland might serve for the same purpose from the sax word byring or buriging or borogeing which we n call burying  no place called thule here i enquired if there was any place or hill here whi they called thule or vle if so be we could receive a information or light from them concerning the the of the ancients but they answered they knew none that name only there was an isle wherein a high  called foula on the west side of the mainland but suppose that ever the ancient romans understood the thereby beside other things that might be alleged  would be a manifest streatching of and an offering vilence to the word but although what this place is ha been much controverted by ancient and modern athors attempting the discovery thereof yet it is genrally agreed upon that it is toward the north a many take it to be one of the british isles and a late athor in an essay concerning the thule of the ancients edeavoureth to prove it to be the north east part of brtain conr cel itinere aith lying over against the isles of orkney citing some authors to this purpose as conradus celtes orcdibus qua cincta suis tyle and glacialis insula and claudian maduerunt sanguine fuso orcades incalu ictorum sanguine thule scotorum cumulos flev glacialis learn and others who call thule britann carum insularum septentrionassimam the most norther of the british isles island also lays claim to it and t above cited author supposes island to be the thule b i judge without any shadow of truth for beside wh is now said rich verstegan i greatly doubt if ever the romans had the knowledge of island their eagles never having com and been displayed to the north of scotland or orkney peru fuerat romani scotia limes says the great scaer ptolomey will have it to be among the isles of tland and boeth our historian distinguishes beween a  st and a  d thule calling ila the  st and leuisa e  d which are reckoned among the isles called hedes so says boeth ptolomaeus inter schethlandis insulas quae ultra orchades sunt hec boeth hist aut proxime norvegiam sitam vult haud quaquam propter immenm intercapedinem intelligi potest nos autem ilam primam leuisam hebridum praestantissimam secundam thulen vo amus but i incline to think that although some ight design a particular place by the thule yet genelly by a synecdoche usual with the roman authors ey might denote all these places remote from them  the north and especially britain and the nothern arts thereof whether their arms did come  in the parish of northmevan is mons ronaldi or ons hill the highest in all this country mons ronalds or rons hill the highest in the country from which ome do say they will see the body of the sun all the ight over in the month of june which cannot be s the reason alleged in our description of orkney why  could not be seen from the top of the hill of hoy o reason and experience show they have a clearer ight in zetland in the night time dureing the sumr season then they can have in orkney zetland being more then a degree to the north of orkney and conequently ay the farther north the shorter night till t length there be no night at all so that if it were ossible to sail holding a northern course till we were under the pole having it for our zenith or vertical point we would have a continual day without any night for several months the sun all that time decribing a circle almost parallel to our horizon i say lmost parallel because beside the diurnal there is alo the annual motion of the sun in the eclyptick o now exact and beautiful an order and symmetrie is to be seen in the works of god they all speaking for the goodness wisdom and power of their maker  what a wonderful creature is the sun coming for as a bridegroom out of his chamber a reflection thereupon and rejoiceing as a str man to run his race absolving every day his circ round our terrestrial globe from east to west a traveling every year between his tropicks the lim and boundaries prescribed him of god beyond whi he is not to pass from south to north and from no to south giving shorter days to those who inhab the middle of the earth under the torrid zone th not being able to bear his longer continuance abo their horizon because of his scorching heat  longer to these who can better endure it under  temperate and yet longest to these who live near to the frigid zones or to the poles whom his h cannot prejudge as it does these who live under or n to the line or middle of the earth on whom he daeth down his perpendicular rays wherefore the wdom of his maker will have him to stay a shorter the above their horizon how wonderful then in cou and excellent in working is this god whereupon not only saints do bless him for the benefits wherewith they are loen but all his works do praise him after their manner  caves there are several caves here or hollow places in a through the rocks particularly there is one in the  of vnst entering from the sea at one side of the i and opposite thereunto on the other side there is ather going in as it were meeting the former unto  end of any of which none will undertake to go t it has been attempted the rage of the sea in the caverns of the earth the failing of the light of d and the raggedness of the rocks by which they m pass making it terrible unto them as also the thick of the air something annoying them but the ent thereunto being opposite one to another gives grou to judge that it is an continued cave from the one s of the isle to the other tho   miles broad which c t be thought to be artificial but natural washen rough by the violence of the waves and the less onder it is for it so to be if we consider that if lla cavat lapidem much more rapidi and tumidi fluctus abunt that if in a short time the drop will wear the one much more in the tract of some thousands of ears the rageing and tempestuous waves daily breakng on the rocks will produce this effect and that ore in some places than in others where the rock will e more friable and brittle and the force of the waves ess broken by the bounding and swadleing sand  there is something like unto this yet more surpriing in the isle of foula a hole in foula on the west side of the mainand if it be true what is storied of it in this isle on the top of a hill there is a hol the mouth whereof may e and some say now is covered with a slaitstone going downwards to the bottom of the rock which is said to be of a great depth particularly a dutch shipaster is reported to have made a trial thereof for the gratifying his curiosity by taking up a barrel of lines with him which he let all down and yet could not found the bottom some say he let down   barrels which is very wonderful considering a barrel of lines is reckoned to be several some say   miles of length what can be the reason of such a conveyance from the top of the rock to the bottom and further if we may give credit to what is said i cannot possibly imagine for that such a thing should be done by art we cannot well conceive the reason why nor the manner how it could be done and that nature should have such an operation will be as difficult to unfold  that this country is generally mossy dangerous traveling soft and spungey has been formerlie told as likewise that it is dangerous for people to travel through it of which many instances may be given i shall only name two which i had from the ministers of the respective bounds one traveling in the isle of yell fell unto such a mossy and loose piece of ground his horse beneath him furniture and all sank down and was no more seen and he himself with great difficulty struggled out and was save and another in the parish of tingwal on the mai not long since walking on foot not far from his o house fell into such another place wherein there d not appear to be any hazard and over which several times forerly he thought he had passed with safety and sank down to the arm pits but he by stretching o his arms keeping his head above the surface of t ground by the help of his servant then providential with him and a staff fixed in the ground got wrestl out so dangerous it is traveling here even to the inhabitants  variation of the compass remarkable as at udsta on the west side of the isle of fetlor there is a plac whereon a gentlemans house called vdsta into which place or house if a mariners needle and compass b brought the needle rests not in its poles as it does i other places but has a tremulous undulating motion and sometimes turns round as some say to all the points of the horizon and a gentleman who was inquisitive to know the truth of this told me that upon trial he found it to be so and further to try the experiment he took the compass to the top of the house where it had the same effect and one of the minister of the northern isles informed me that if any ship o boat sailed by or came nigh unto that place the sam did befall their compass and on a hill in whalsey also there is a little hill nig to the sea on the west side of the isle of whalsey t which if the compass be brought the flowr de luce o that point which is ordinarily obverted to the north turns about to the south but if the compass be removed the distance of two of three foot from the top o the hill there is no such effect produced this the late minister of the place assured me of having trie the experiment  observes thereupon the many wonderful properties and effects of the magnes or lodestone and of other things endue with or which do partake of this magnetic vertue discovered in these latter ages has deservedly raised e admiration of philosophers and awakened them to ake a diligent inquiry and search into the reasons of hese strange phenomena that the magnes has two oles answering to the poles of the world to which it oeth it self that the load stone draws iron unto  that iron brought unto and rubbed upon the lodestone receives from it that attractive or as some will ave it that impulsive virtue and power and other alities inherent in it hence the invention of the needle so useful and necessary to mariners for directing their courses that if there be two spherical loadtones they will turn to one another as each of them oth to the oles of the earth and if they be detained  a contrary position they will flee from one another and so is it with the needle in the compass when a oad stone or piece of iron is brought unto it the eedle either comes to or flees from it according to s situation wherefore mariners are careful that no on be in nor lying near unto their lightroom where e compass stands renat des carts in his princip philos reckons    that tho you should take the eedle from its beloved pole yet when let alone and ft to it self it will incontinently move and take no st until it return thereunto these strange and unuth properties has the load stone as likewise any others no less astonishing reckoned up by it is admirers many of which are known to the rudest d most illiterate mariner but to explain the nature of e lodestone and to resolve and answer the propols of nature upon the head by giving the reasons of ese admirable effects hoc opus hic labor est this is the difficulty which has vexed many and taken up the studies of the sagest and most ingenious modern philosoers  i shall not presume to give the reason of this strange henomenon an essay concerning the reason thereof the needles leaving it is rest at the pole and betaking it self to such a motion whether tremuus and undulating or circular round the points of the compass or the flower de luce turning to the so only i would suggest two things which if they t not to clear what is proposed they will furt hold out how wonderful the lodestone and properties are first upon the ordinary suppositi whereby these properties are explained that the ea is as a great lodestone on the surface and exter parts whereof a great number of volatile screwli particles called the magnetic matter do uncessan move traveling from pole to pole along the surfa of the earth whereby the poles of the lodestone a the point of the needle affected with its virtue a obverted to the poles of the world which suppositi being made we would know that this manetick matter may not always have the sa motion but in some places it may be upward a perpendicular to the surface of the earth so that these places where they thus move perpendicularly t needle will not be determined to one point more the to another of the horizon this matter alike affecti all the parts of the needle by its perpendicular motion which the ingenious rohault alleges as the reason w the compass serves not the use of the hollanders wh they have sailed far to the north in order to find o a new and shorter passage to the east indies the needle then not turning to the poles as it does in ot places but alike to all the points of the horiz the motion of the magnetic matter in these more nothern places being in lines perpendicular to the surfa of the earth and so likewise it may fall out in ot places where a greater quantity of this magneti matter rises from the earth  a  d thing that i would take notice of is that t magnetic matter in it is passage from pole to p meets with several iron mines into which it go aside so diverting its straight course between the pol because it finds an easier passage through the pores the iron then by passing through other places he e variation of the compass is judged to be so much kt of by mariners in some places greater and in hers less accordingly as the magnetic matter is t or less determined by the several iron mines into which it turns aside now in some places it may so out that there may be a greater quantity of iron ough which the magnetic matter passing and from ich it arising may cause such a motion whereby  needle not only inclines not to one point more n to another in the horizon but also by the magick matters ascending from and returning to the iron nes it may produce such an irregular motion in e needle and that there is a great quantity of iron zetland may be knoun by the remarkable variation the compass there for as mariners inform us when y sail by the southend of zetland they find the ation to be but one point but when passing the orth end they find it varies   points and upon this iation in directing their course to this or the other ce they make their reckoning which is very obvable that in less then a degree of latitude for no e will the length of the isles of zetland be it vaa a point of the compass which must be according the reason commonly assigned because there is th iron in these isles and more especially on the st side of the isle of fetlor for other places of the e isle have no such influence on the compass  that yet much if not the greatest part of the diffity remains i readily grant some difficulty remains and leaves it to the study he learned and curious and indeed in many things acknowledge our ignorance has been reputed no all part of wisdom so hard it is to solve and unridle tures secrets wherein the greatest lights have n benighted the following often rasing the founions of the doctrines of the former how wonful are the works of god that in wisdom he has e them all and how narrow and shallow are capacities that we cannot find out the works of god even the most sensible and obvious how tha ful also should we be to god who has vouchsa to us the light of clearly revealed truth which taken heed unto shall make us perfect and lead u glory  little chapels there are in these isles many little chapels  generally ruinous as in the isle of vnst there are and upwards in the isle of yell there are    many in other isles i saw one of them in the pa of tingwal wherein also there are several m would have contained scarce  0 people as i ju and tho so little yet very great stones were in walls which was strange to me how that in country where their beasts are weak and they  not the help of machines they got them lifted laid these are said to have been built by supersous zealots in the times of opery or as some ra think by ship wrackt seamen who coming safe shore have built them according to their vows m by them when in danger which they dedicated t many several saints whom they looked upon as patrons of their respective chapels about w also men and women of old had their night walk which occasioned much uncleanness but now  walkings are but little used  snails which are medicinal found about the walls about the walls of these old chapels are for snails called shellsnails which they dry and verize mingling the dust with their drink for the jadice by which means these who labor under this sness in   or   days time will recover of the sa but if they let this dustly for a year without mak use of it it turns into small living creatures or v mine which they dry and bray over again if t make any further use of it  a metal like gold found in vzta in vzta an isle lying nigh to vnst there is a ntal gotten having the color of gold which sev of the dutch merchants have taken with them to hburgh and tried it there but by the force of fire it not become liquid but crumbled into small pieces it is to be had there in great plenty this shows there may be minerals in these isles tho not known nor searched for  in the churchyard of papastour a gravestone in papastour in the parish of waes lies a stone   foot long at the one end two and at the other one foot broad concave from the one end to the other of which the common tradition goes that this stone came a shore on that sle with a dead man tied to it who lys buried there beside it it appears to have been the grave stone of some person of note in the country which shows they have also had that custom of laying at least some of their dead in such large stones made concave and cut out for the purpose which has been frequent in many places with us in scotland  at a little distance from papa stour a rock i the sea where the ruins of an old house lies a rock encompassed with the sea called frauastack which is a danish word and signifies our ladys rock upon which are to be seen the ruins of a house wherein they say a gentleman did put his daughter that so she might be shut up and secluded from the company of men but tho a maiden when put in yet she was found with child when brought out notwithstanding of her being so closly kept but whither this came to pass by a golden shower the most powerful courtship or not the country has lost the tradition however it seems strange how a house should be built on such a bare and small rock when so many large and pleasant isles were near unto it  the three ironcannons formerly mentioned now lying in the citadale of lerwick being rusted by the sea cannons discharge themselves wherein they had lien for  0 years the inhabitants of lerwick to take of the rust and so fit them for their use about   years ago did set a heap of pites about them which they putting fire unto the guns so soon as they were warmed and hot did all discharge themselves to the great surprisal of the spectatours and the balls as some observed went half over brassa sound which deserves some remark that the powder all that time should retain its elastick force the water if at all yet not so insinuating if self with the powder as to wash it away or much diminish it virtue these who were eye witnesses gave me this relation  fishes and cattle ittle or no iver it is observable that the former year      the fishes had little or no liver but something black i lieu thereof which was a great loss to the fishers they making their oil of those livers as also the oxen sheep swine etc had little or no fat on their livers which uses not to be there being a kind of consumption upon the livers of creatures both by sea and land which minds me of romans     mans sins making the creation to groan and earnestly long as with an uplifted head for a deliverance so that it the creatures could speak with balaams ass they would reprove the madness and sin of man  in vaila no cat will live there is a little isle on the west side of waes called vaila wherein there is no cat neither will any stay tho brought in as has been done for trial but will quickly be gone they either dying or betaking themselves to sea they endeavor to sweem to the next isle yet about  0 years ago there was one seen upon this isle about that time when a gentleman the proprietor thereof was tormented and put to death by the witches but never any were seen since save what were brought in for trial as now said the reason of this i could not learn from the ministers who gave the information it is like because of the air or the smell of something upon the isle tho not perceivable by the inhabitants which agrees not with the temper and constitution of these animals  nop of ebister here a arlet or izard ed about a mile from tingwal to the north there is a hill called the knop of kebister or luggies know nigh to which hill there is a house called kebister where a varlet or wizard lived commonly designed luggie concerning whom it was reported that when the sea was so tempestuous that the boats durst not go off to the fishing he used to go to that hill or know wherein a hole into which he let down his lines and took up any fish he pleased as a cod or ling etc which no other could do but himself also when fishing at sea he would at his pleasure take up any roasted fish with his line with the intrals or guts out of it and so ready for his use this was certainly done by the agency of evil spirits with whom he was in compact and covenant but the economy of the kingdom of darkness is very wonderful and little known to us he being convicted of witchcraft was burnt nigh to scalloway  as for witches i did not ear much of them concerning witches as if they abounded more in this than other countries tho i make no question but that there are many such here thus deluded by the devil there is not then such ground for what is so commonly talked by many with us anent their devilry which might have affrighted us if given heed unto as if it were dangerous going or living there tho it is said here there are many of this hellish stamp in island lapland and other places to the north of zetland which may occasion the mistake  we said before that there were but few rats concerning rats and mice and that only in some of the isles and thought to come out of ships but that they had mice in abundance yet in the isles of burra and hakashy no mice are to be found yea if they take some dust or earth out of these isles to other places where they are they will forsake such places where the dust is laid when rats leave the ships it is looked upon by mariners as fatal to these ships it may be for the like reason why no cats can or will live in vaila  sometimes when the ships are lying nigh land the rats will come ashore which when any of the hollanders or others see they look upon it as fatal to the ship out of which they come portending that her end some way or other will shortly approach and likewise it is observed that these rats will not live abo   or   years in that land to which they come so of our seamen tell us of the like as to their ships is talked also that these creatures will leave houses before any dismal accident befall them what grou there is either for the one or the other i know not b if true it will be hard i suppose to give the reas thereof  evil spirits not above  0 or  0 years ago almost every family had a brouny or evil spirit so called which serve them to whom they gave a sacrifice for his service as when they churned their milk they took a pa thereof and sprinkled every corner of the house wit it for brounies use likewise when they brewed the had a stone which they called brounies stone where there was a little hole into which they poured some wort for a sacrifice to brouny my informer a minister in the country told me that he had converse with an old man who when young used to brew an sometimes read upon his bible to whom an old woman in the house said that brouny was displeased with that book he read upon which if he continued to do they would get no more service of brouny but h being better instructed from that book which wa brounies eyesore and the object of his wrath when he brewed he would not suffer any sacrifice to be given to brouny whereupon the  st and  d brewings were spilt and for no use tho the wort wrought well yet in a little time it left off working and grew cold but of the  d browst or brewing he had ale very good tho he would not give any sacrifice to brouny with whom afterward they were no more troubled i had also from the same informer that a lady in vn now deceased told him that when she first took up house she refused to give a sacrifice to brouny upon which the  st and  d brewings misgave likewise but the  d was good and browny not being regarded nor rewarded as formerly he had been abaned his wonted service which clears that scripre resist the devil and he will flee from you ja    they also had acks of corn which they called brounies stacks which o they were not bound with strawropes or any way need as other stacks use to be yet the greatest storm  wind was not able to blow any straw off them  now i do not hear of any such appearances the devil makes in these sles evil spirits not now so frequently seen as formerly so great and and many are e blessings which attend a gospel dispensation the ounies fairies and other evil spirits that haunted  were familiar in our houses were dismissed and ed at the breaking up of our reformation if we ay except but a few places not yet well reformed om popish dregs as the heathen oracles were silced at the coming of our lord and the going rth of his apostles so that our first noble reformers ight have returned and said to their master lu  0   as the  0 ce did lord even the devils are subject to us through y name and tho this restraint put upon the devil as far latter in these northern places then with us to whom the light of a preached gospel did more early ine yet now also do these northern isles enjoy the uits of this restraint the appearance of an old man in the water   about two years and an half or three years ago ere was a boat passing with several gentlemen of the country in it and by the way in the voe of quarf through which they went here appeared something unto them with its head above the water which as hey could discern had the face of an old man with  long beard hanging down first it appeared at some istance from them and then coming nearer to their ot they had a clear sight of it the sight was  very strange and affrighting that all in the boat were very desirous to be on land tho the day was fair and the sea calm a gentleman declaring as a miniter in company with them and saw this sight inormed me that he never saw the like tho he had traelled through many seas  and of a woman i heard another remarkable story like unto this the about   years since a boat at the fishing drew h lines and one of them as the fishers thought having some great fish upon it was with greater difficulty the the rest raised from the ground but when raised came more easily to the furface of the water upon which a creature like a woman presented it self at the side of the boat it had the face arms breasts shouders etc of a woman and long hair hanging dot the back but the nether part from below the breast was beneath the water so that they could not understand the shape thereof the two fishers who were the boat being surprised at this strange sight one  them unadvisedly drew a knife and thurst it into h breast whereupon she cried as they judged al and the hook giving way she fell backward and w no more seen the hook being big went in at h chin and out at the upper lip the man who thr the knife into her is now dead and as was observed never prospered after this but was still haunted by an evil spirit in the appearance of an old man who  he thought used to say unto him will ye do such a thing who killed the woman the other man then in the bo is yet alive in the isle of burra this a gentleman and his lady told me who said they had it from the baillie of that place to which the boat did belong  being so strange i enquired at severals thereane which tho many were ignorant of yet some said that they had heard thereof and judged it to be very tru  creatures in the likeene of men frequently seen at sea that there are seacreatures having the likeness  men and women seems to be generally acknowledge by all who have enquired thereunto they having found it confirmed by the teffimony of many in sever countries as their histories do bear hence are acounts given of those sea monsters the meermen an meermaids which have not only been seen but apprehended and keept for some time and hence probably the fiction of the poets concerning the sirenes ha had its rise these enchanting songsters translated eermaids by our lexicographers whose snare ulysses  happily escaped  they tell us that several such creatures do appear to fishers at sea particularly such as they call seatrowers several such creatures appear to fishers at sea as sea trowes eat rolling creatures tumbling in the waters which  they come among their nets they break them and sometimes takes them away with them if the fishers e them before they come near they endeavor to eep them off with their oars or long staves and if ey can get them beaten therewith they will endeavor to do it the fishers both in orkney and zetland e afraid when they see them which panick fear of eirs makes them think and sometimes say that it is e devil in the shape of such creatures whether it be  or not as they apprehend i cannot determine owever it seems to be more then probable that il spirits frequent both sea and land  a gentleman in the parish of dunressness told one  the ministers in this country fresh cockles got on the land that about   years nce a plough in this parish did cast up fresh cockles to the place where the plough was going was three arters of a mile from the sea which cockles the entlemen saw made ready and eaten how these ell fishes came there and should be fed at such a stance from their ordinary element i cannot know if they have not been cast upon land by a violent storm such of the ground of this parish especially what ey labor lying very low and the sea has been observed in such storms both to cast out stones and ishes or if these cockels have been found in some ep furrow from which to the sea there has been  conveyance by some small stream upon which the a has flowed in stream tides especially when there  also some storm blowing if only shells were found ch as of oysters and the like the marvel would not e great seeing such are found upon the tops of high ountains at a greater distance from the sea which in all probability have been there since the unive deluge but that any shellfish should be found some distance from the sea and fit for use is son what wonderful and astonishing  a tortoise found in the sand tho no tortoises use to be found in all these northern seas yet in vtefirth in the parish of north there was one found alive upon the sand in an ebb t shell of it was given me as a present by a gentlem of the country it is about a foot length and a lar half foot in breadth the inhabitants thought  strange never any such having been found in these  formerly which ever they came to the knowledge  that they could not imagine what to make of it son saying that it has fallen out of some east india ship aing along by the coasts which looks not so probably  there is a plce in this country called the neip the parish of neston looking to the east sea the parson of orphir killed where the parson of orphir in orkney was killed the story is thi patrick stewart earl of orkney as has been said w a great oppressor enacting several severe and cru acts whereof complaint was made to king james  and as it is reported some zetlanders went to the king with their skincoats laying the oppressed condition of their country before him wherewith the king was moved yet although not only the earls honor and reputation withal was much stained and under a cloud by reason of his cruel and oppressive ways but his person was hated and abhored by the people whose superior he was the parson of orphir d zealously stand in the earls defense notwithstanding whereof the indignation and kindled wrath of the exasperated people against the earl increasing the parson was forced to flee to zetland for his safety upon which the people of orkney not quieted some of them pursued him thither they say the pursuers were   brethern of the name of sinclar who coming to the nei where the parson had his ordinary residence they apprehended and dewitted him one of the brethren taking a sop of his heartblood as for the earl being first emprisoned at dumbartoun he was thence brought to edinburgh where he was beheaded anno      for treason and oppression  there are also in this country as well as in orkney many eagles which destroy their lambs fowls concerning eagles etc for the preventing of which some when they ee the eagles catching or fleeing away with their prey se a charm by taking a string whereon they cast some knots and repeats a form of words which being done the eagle lets her prey fall tho at a great distance from the charmer an instance of which i had from a minister who told me that about a month before we came to zetland there was an eagle that ew up with a cock at scalloway which one of these charmers seeing presently took a string his garter as was supposed and casting some knots thereupon with the using the ordinary words the eagle did let the cock fall into the sea which was recovered by a boat that went out for that end  they tell a pleasant story of an eagle and a turbot about   years since an eagle fell down on a turbot sleeping on the surface of the water concerning an eagle and a turbot on the east side of brassa and having fastened his claws in her he attempted to flee up but the turbot awakning and being too heavy for him to flee up with endeavored to raw him down beneath the water thus they strugled for ome time the eagle laboring to go up and the turbot to go down till a boat that was near to them and beheld the sport took them both selling the eagle to the hollanders hen in the country for they say when the eagle has astned his claws in any creature he cannot loose them this pleasure but uses to eat them out so that the prey sometimes comes to be a snare to this rapacious fowl  on the west side of the mainland a holm frequented by sea fowls there is a holm belonging to a gentleman in the parish of northern van  much frequented by fowl that when sometimes they go in to it in the summer season fowls of several kinds will flee so thick above their heads that the will cloud the very air yet therein there are few  none during the winter but in february they use  begin to come by pairs and for two or   days aft they first come they will sit so close that almost they m be taken hold of which is imputed to their being wearied after a long flight from some far country the proprietour of this holm may almost every day in summer take a basket full of eggs out of it and they scarcely be missed for it is so well furnished the none almost can set down a foot for young fowls  eggs which are very serviceable to this gentleman house and the country about  noss of brassa high to the east of brassa is an isle called the noss brassa wherein a ragged rock looking to south east the highest in all this country serviceable to mariners for directing their course when sailling to the west from eastern countries some gentlemen told  that they verily think from the surface of the water to the top of the rock it will be  00 fathoms upon which a great many fowls have their nett whose eggs they take in the summer time as also some of the fowls by letting a man down from the to of the rock by a rope tied about his middle before this isle lies a rock raggie on all sides about  00 fathomshigh from the surface of the water but b reason of its raggedness and declivity and its being surrounded with sea on all hands it is scarce possible t climb it a holm dying before it where fowls numerous yet the owners of the isle being desirous to be a the fowls and eggs numerous upon it about  0 years since there was a man for the hire of a co undertook to climb the lesser rock and to fasten  pales or stakes thereupon which he accordingly did bu in the cominng down he fell into the sea and perished  the way how they get into this holm remarkable the way how they get into this lesser rock is observable which is thus opposite to the two stakes o the lesser there are also stakes fastened on the highe rock it being but    fathoms over between the rocks to which stakes ropes are fastened reaching from rock to rock the ropes they put through the oles of an engine called a craddle all which being so prepared a man gets into the cradle and warpeth himself over from the noss or the greater rock to the ffer and so having made a good purchase of eggs and owls bought at the expense of the danger of his life  returns the same way he went these ropes hang ot on all winter but in the summer time in the month of june ordinarily when the day is calm they st the ropes from the greater to the lesser rock which so they do they have  st some small rope or ordage to which there is a stone fastened and they eeping both the ends of this small rope in their ands an able man throws the stone into the lesser ock and when casten over the stakes they heave or ft up this small rope with a long pole that so the ought of the rope may be gotten about the stakes which being done they draw to them the small rope ll a greater tied to it be brought about also  and so oth ends of the greater rope they secure by the stakes n the top of the noss industriae nihil impossible nil tam difficile est quod non solertia vincat on which strong and greater ope the cradle being put it runs from rock to ock easily a man in the cradle goes from the noss  the holm or rock by reason of its descent but with greater difficulty do they return therefore there is a mall rope tied to the cradle whereby men on the loss help to draw them back i do not hear that any there such another cradle is to be found how many re the inventions which man has found out  this holm is much frequented by fowls more than any other place on the east side of zetland this holm frequented by fowls as the ther holm of northmevan is on the west side the owls have their nests on the holms in a very beautiful order all set in raws in the form of a dovecoat and ch kind or sort do nestle by themselves as the scarfs y themselves so the cetywaicks tominories mawes c there is a fowl there called the scutiallan of a black color and as big as a wild duck which do live upon the vomit and excrements of other fow whom they pursue and having apprehended them the cause them vomit up what meat they have lately take not yet digested the lords works both of natu and of grace are wonderful all speaking forth h glorious goodness wisdom and power  concerning the dangers the inhabitants undergo remarkable are the dangers which many in the isles do undergo in climbing the rocks for fowls a eggs especially in foula where the inhabitants in the summer time do most live by this kind of provision and are judged to be the best climbers of rocks in a this country for some of them will fasten a stake o knife as some say in the ground on the top of the rock to which they ty a small rope or cord and  they will come down the face of the rock with the in their hand  0  0 or  0 fathoms and do return bringing up eggs and fowls with them but indeed very many of them lose their lives this way ye it is observed that few old men are to be seen ther they being so cut off before they arrive at old age many of them are weary of the dangers and hazard they daily incur yet neither will they leave the place nor give over these perilous attempts all the sad instances of their friends and neighbors perishing an death cannot have this influence to deter and affrigh them from undergoing the like hazards labor omnia vincet improbus and duris urgens in rebus egestas virg at so sma a rate do they value their lives that for a few fow and eggs they will endanger them whereas they might have as good and a much safer living elsewher as this shows both their folly and their sin impiger extremos currit mercator ad indos per mae pauperiem fugiens per laxa per ignes  what fatigue and danger men will expose themselves t for the avoiding poverty and straits for the upholding this clayie tabernacle which ere long will mould into the dust and often not so much for the satisfying the necessary cravings of nature as the superfluous an insatiable desires of our lusts sometimes one man will stand on the top of the rock holding the end  the rope in his hand and another will go down which neither is without danger as they tell us of one o thus holding his neighbor did let the rope slip d down fell the climber into the sea but providenly there being a boat near by they got hold of him d took him in and so came home before his neighbor who judged him to have perished the other an at length came home with great sorrow and grief grating the death of his neighbor but he hearing  he was already come home was not a little conunded and astonished at the report until that at eeting the man in danger narrated the manner of his eliverance which afforded unto them both great atter of refreshment and joy  in all this country there are only three towred churches i e churches with towers on them three towred churches to t tngwal on the mainland the church of burra on e isle of burra and the church of ireland a promony belonging to the main from the top of one of which towers you can see another built they say by ree sisters who from their several towers could ve advertisement to one another  the church of tingwal stands on a valley between two hills lying east and west a holm called the lawting and is about the ddle of the mainland it was in this parish in a all holm within a lake high to this church there the principal feud or judge of the country el to fit and give judgment hence the holm to this ay is called the lawting from which probably the arish of tingwal had its name we go into this holm  steping stones where three or four great stones e to be seen upon which the judge clerk and other officers of the court did sit all the country concerned to be there stood at some distance from the olm on the side of the loch and when any of their auses was to be judged or determined or the judge ound it necessary that any person should compear before him he was called upon by the officer and went in by these steping stones who when heard retur the same way he came and tho now this place be  the seat of judgment there is yet something am them to this day which keeps up the memory their old practice for at every end of the loch the is a house upon whose grass the country men coing to the court did leave their horses and by rea the masters of these houses did suffer a loss this w they were declared to be scatfree hence at this pres time two places in the parish of sanfling do pay s for the one and coningsburg in dunrossness for t other scat is a kind of rent or due which is yea paid to the king or his taxmen by the gentlem and several others in the country this court thought to have been kept by the danes when the were in the possession of the country they also  port that when any person received sentence of dea upon the holm if afterward he could make his esca through the crowd of people standing on the side the loch without being apprehended and touch  steeple of the church of tingwal the sentence of dea was retrieved and the condemned obtained an indenity for this steeple in these days was held as asyl for malefactors debitors charged by their cditors etc to flee into  an obelisk between tingwal and scalloway in the way between tingwal and scalloway there an high stone standing in form of an obelisk as so ancient monument concerning which the people ha various traditions some saying that in the strath tingwal where this stone is erected there was a bloo fight between the danes and the old inhabitants natives of this country and that the norvegian danish general was killed in this place where t stone is set up others report that one of the ea of orkney had a profligate and prodigal son who  this cause being animadverted upon by his father fl to zetland and there built a castle or a strong ho for himself within a loch at stroma within two mi tingwal to the west the ruins whereof are yet be seen his father not being satisfied with his ape and the way he took for his defense sent from kney   or   men to pursue him to whom he gave ders that they should bring his son to him either d or alive the son thereupon not finding him safe enough in his castle made his escape from  castle where the pursuers lay in ambush but was ertaken by them in the strath of tingwal and killed re whereupon this monument was erected the rsuers took off his head and carried it with them to  father but in so doing they were so far from graying of him that he caused them all to be put to  death notwithstanding of the orders given by   there is in the parish of tingwal a little off the way  we go from lerwick to scalloway concerning a spring a fountain or ing of very pure and pleasant water which run through a great stone in the rock by the passage of ound hole which if you stop the water forces its y through the pores of the stone in other places  stone it seems being very porous and spungy  one of the ministers told us of a monster born the  year in the parish of neston about   or  0 monsters born les from lerwick that one day when he was comg to the presbytry and standing at the ferryside er which he was to pass two women came to him quainting him with fear and grief that their neighur near by had been traveling in childbirth under d labor for   days past and had brought forth monster which had upon its forehead like a pirwig  flesh and hair raised and towered up and by e sides of the head there were like wires of flesh ming down moreover it had two raws of teeth th a mouth like a rabbet destitute of arms and gs after the birth there was some life in it and  moved a little but lived not long the women isting at the birth for a time were afraid to touch it it being such a strange and formidable sight t minister desired to see it but it was buried before came the same woman also formerly had brou forth two monsters the first whereof was a con and undigested mp of flesh and the second ha mouth in its breast  we enquired concerning the woman and they t us that they knew nothing of scandal they could la her charge but that she had lived soberly all her li only one of the ministers informed us that after had brought forth the first monter he heard that a years time thereafter she used to go bare footed the church of wisdale every lords day and p there according to the vow she had made after birth thinking thereby that this might atone what was past and prevent the like for the future this be true god has judicially punished her conceiving and bringing forth the two follow monsters each more wonderful and preternatural t the other  gods judgments on adulterers several adulteries came before the commission atteed with heinous aggravating circumstances one stance we had very remarkable of one james mo in the parish of north mevan who had been lying adultery with one clara tutloch his wie being d not many years since between which mowa tulloch there were several children procreated  were all idiots and fools so that they could not k themselves either from fire or water or put t meat in their mouths tho there be one of them of years and others of them tho younger yet come some considerable age which shows the mani judgment of god against adulterers he often oring his providential dispensations so toward the that they may read their sin in their punishment this wretched man was forced by the power of his so convinced conscience to confess before the presbyt that he was sensible the judgments of god were psuing him whereof he gave the said sad instance as et to be seen from the presbyteries records another adulterer also did compeir before us who did continue in the commission of this his sin for many years and does bear in his face the shameful reproof thereof and the just marks of the lords indignation against him for the same it is a very sad thing for any to be pining away both in judgments and sins  a minister here told me a passage not to be passed without a remark of gods righteous judgment and holiness another instance of gods judgments on adulterers a certain woman in his parish about  0 years since fell into adultery with an old married man he to cover his villainy advised her to give way to another young mans sinning with her who then was n suit of her and frequented her company that so if there were a child she might father it upon this young and unmarried man accordingly as was advised it fell out the young man sinned with her and she being found with child is summoned to compeir before the session who having interrogated her concerning her uncleanness and who was the father of the child she answered that she never knew or had carnal dealing with any save such a young man but this covering could not serve the turn in palliating their filthiness god in his wise providence so ordering it that tho there was the interval of   months between the old and the young mans sinning with her yet when the time of her delivery came she first brought forth a perfect child of   months and the day after another imperfect of   months according to the several times of the old man and the young mans sining with her she being convinced that this was of the lord and that she could not hide her sins from god tho she sought to do it from men she ingenuously acknowledged her guilt with both and for the scandal is now giving satisfaction in the parish of vnst  another instance we had also the lamentable account of the tragical end of one mr gilbert hendry adulterer in repute for his acuteness of wit and the many excellen poems he composed he being a married man had carnal converse with another woman at which his friends and welwishers being greatly concerned one o them laid hold of an oppertunity to accost and set upon him earnestly entreating he might break off his unclea and debauched converse with that woman holding ou unto him his sin and misery and using what arguments he thought might prevail for that end but h gave a deaf ear unto all that was said and by no mean would be dissuaded from haunting her company ye in contempt of the admonition and reproof made as  he were going to that womans house the same night and so parting from his friend went in the evening to water or loch side where he walked for some tim alone and then appeared a man in company with him all in black and thus they contiuned walking together till night as the people observing did judge and the next morning this miserable wretch was found dea with his brains dashed out tho there were no stone near to that place where he lay on a hill side at a little distance from the water his head and shoulders lying dounward to the descent of the hill his brains wen scattered and the ground about him was all trodden a if there had been says my informer  0 men and horses for    hours upon the spot it is not many year since this fell out so bad a recompense does the devi give his vassals and slaves for their service for whoremongers and adulterers god will judge which judgment often he begins to inflict in this life for the punishment of the guilty and the terror of all and to show that he is of purer eyes then that he can behold such horrid iniquity observe on the spanish armado tho the pouring out of the full vials of his wrath he reserveth for the future where their worm shall not die nor the fire for ever be quenched  the signal defeat and overthrow of the spanish armado that supposed and commonly tho arrogantly caled invincible navy anno      is famous in history which was especially caused by stormy winds and temests some thereby sinking at sea others spleeting upon he coasts both of england and france and especially upon the north of scotland orkney and zetland and the  isle had the honor of the duke of medians being iven ashore upon it under whose conduct this navy as who after his shipwreck came over to dunrossess in zetland as an old gentlewoman informed me f whom she heard the country people who saw him equently speak when she was a child so the lord ispersed and broke this huge and formidable navy t of an hundred and thirty ships which set out from ain with provision ammunition and other furniture exceeding great scarce  0 returned the god of land d sea heard and answered the prayers of his people  britain the curse of god pursuing that hellish enterrise notwithstanding of the infallible popish benedictn on that invincible armado for as our historian lderwood observes the rumor of the great spanish armado being blazed abroad called hist on anno      fervent were the prayers of the godly in scotland powerful and peircing were the sermons of preachers especially in the time of fast whereupon the lord uttered his voice against his and his churches

it by it sel which i shall labo to do by showing what fishing they have in these se and what fishes they do most abound in and have plenty of and then hold out who are these who trade a what advantages do accrue thereby unto the natants with some reflections upon the whole  the fishing decayed beside what formerly it has been the fishing here is much decayed by what it wa for now neither is there such a great number of fish taken nor so easily can they be had as formerly  not above  0 or  0 years since the fishers wo have taken the great fishes such as killen ling and in the voes or lochs and that in great numbers a so were not necessitated to underly such danger a toil in going out to the sea but could have lien before their oun doors and drawn the fishes whi certainly was more safe easy and convenient to the in many respects whereas now they are obliged  put out some leagues unto the sea and so far oft that they almost sink the land else they cannot a any fishing worth their expense and pains whi cannot but be very toilsome and dangerous in case storm should arise and blow off the land and so p them to sea with their little boats or yoals not ab to keep ong out against the violent and swelling wav and so has it fallen ot unto some who being toss to and fro whether tide and wind did drive the have never seen land any more and as it is dangs so it is toilsome and costs them much labor ing often they ly some nights and days at sea and  come ashore  the fishing formerly being greater then what now s occasioned they say notwithstanding their fishing yet is great some hundreds of mo ships sort yearly unto this country then what now  to do when fishes cannot be had for to serve them  indeed neither now are the fishes so sought after ometime they have been when they could be easily  many being willing rather to stay at home and ch what they can about the coasts which ordinarily  but the smaller fishes then to undergo such hazards  toil in following the greater which an hamburghchant waiting for a lading complained to me of  although when we institute the comparison between  former and the latter times fishes taken in great numbers anno   00 their present fishing l appear to be but small yet if we take it under w as it is in it self without such a respect we will find o be very considerable for tho in some years it be ater then in others yet every year many trading os are thereby laded and this same year   00 the ing is thought to be very good an instance whereof merchant gave us that in one week in the month  june there were taken by some boats belonging to  place of northmevan  000 ling all which were ught in for the loadening of that ship wherein he  concerned and another gentleman added that e other boats at a little distance from these drew ut  00 mo but this was something exterordinary  uses not often to fall out that in one week they e such a number  the fishes that do most abound here are killin what fishes abound here g etc which being salted and dried foreigners export m to other countries of these as has been said re is a great plenty but are not ordinarily taken near  land as for haddocks whitings and such lesser ite fishes they care not so much for the seeking af except what is for their oun use for strangers use but seldom to buy them and these greater fishes the get a greater quantity of in some places then in other as off dunrossness northmevan vnst yell etc  herring numerous great shoals of herring do sweem also in these se which are taken in the summer season especially the month of july and the beginning of august sometimes then they will come within a penniest cast of the shore and be sweeming so thick and ta so fast that one boat will call upon another to co and help them and take a part of their fishes the herrings taken here are reckoned to be very good not among the best that are taken upon the isles  longing to the king of britains dominions and as n said of the white fish so it is of the herrings they fquent some places more then others as off brassa to t east and between brassa and whalsey or the skerr where the bushes do commonly ly within sight of  land of zetland and whatever may be said of gro his mare commune or liberum yet it holds here for a have or take liberty to come and fish in these se without any way acknowledging that soveraig whereunto these isles do belong  so silluks and seths out of whose livers good oil is got there are likewise here a great many gray fis taken which they call silluks and seths which  judged to be the same kind of fish only the seths a greater and older silluks a thick and fat fish out of one liver of some seths they will get a pint our measure of oil with which oil the inhabita pay part of their rents and sells the rest unto mchents the oil they get after this manner they  the liver into a pot or pan half full of water wh when seething the oil by the force of the fire or being water is drawn from the liver which so be separated and sweeming above they take or scum off and puts in vessels for the use these seths are be had about all the coasts but more especially ab dunrossness delton and some other places the luks as has been observed are very numerous in o but more rarely are the seths to be had there tho e same kind of fish but in zetland there is no scarci of both  among the many other excellent fishes which are re for to be had there are the tusk a rare tusk a rare fish wholesome d delicious fish no less pleasant to the taste then ey are to the eye some of them are as big as ling a broun and yellow color with a broad tail when aking ready for use they swell in the pan more then y other fish when made ready their fish is very hite and clear when new haled they are much ore pleasant to eat then when salted and dried for n i think they lose much of their savor and reh they begin to fish for them about the end of may  beginning of june and are taken to the east of the e of brassa or between brassa and whalsey opening to e coasts of norway and here only are they to be und and more rarely in other places except off dunsiness where also sometimes they are got the fiers often go out about the beginning of the week d not return home till the end of it and the further ey go off to the sea they will get them the bigger d in greater numbers they use to sell them to the amburghers for   or  0 lib scots the  00 or six ore and some of them also are taken to other places here they are much desired by such as know them  those who commonly frequent this country and ade with the inhabitants are hamburghers this country frequented by hamburgers bremers etc and somemes bremers and others who come here ordinarily  the month of may or about the beginning of june d in several places set up booths or shops where ey sell liquours as beer brandie etc and wheatead as that which they call cringel bread and the ke they also sell several sorts of cremeware as lin muslin etc and these merchants seek nothing tter in exchange for their commodities then to truk ith the country for their fishes which when the shers engage to the merchants will give them either money or ware which they please and so  fishers going to sea what they take they bring o in the week or oftener as they have occasion  lays them down at their booth door or in any o place where the merchant appoints them to be  and they being there numbered the merchants acco for them accordingly these fishes which are oarly great white fishes as killen ling and the like merchants or their servants having dried they t them aboard of their ships several such d booths are to be seen through the isles as   ordarily in the isle of vnst two in yell etc  hollanders also repair there unto for herringfishing the hollanders also repair to these isles in j as has been said for their herring fishing but t cannot be said so properly to trade with the count as to fish upon their coasts and they use to bring sorts of provisions necessary with them save s fresh victuals as sheep lambs hens etc wh they buy on shore stockins also are brought by  country people from all quarters to lerwick and s to these fishers for sometimes many thousands of the will be ashore at one time and ordinary it is wi them to buy stokins to themselves and some likew do to their wives and children which is very berial to the inhabitans for so money is brought in the country there is a vent for the wool and t poor are employed stokins also are brought from orkney and sold there whereby some gain accrues the retailers who wait the coming of the dutch fle for a market  much advantage redoundeth to them from their trade with the hamburgers but especially much advantage does redound  them from their trade with the hamburgers for besides that they are furnished by them with provision what necessary what convenient these merchants brin a considerable sum of money with them so that  one of their ministers told me   ships are ordinar reckoned to have   00 dollars aboard which the leave behind them not only for fishes but also for several other things which are the product of the country as butter oil etc and if any please not to take their commodities they presently give them money upon the receipt of the goods the proprietors also or masters of the ground upon which these booths are built reap a considerable gain for some of them will get to dollars per annum for the use of a house in the summer season to be a booth and i think twice or thrice the sum will build them  upon the whole of this chap we may entertain these following reflections first some reflections on this chap hence we may observe the power wisdom and goodness of god his power in that his hands have made this great and wide sea ps  0    wherein are things creeping innumerable how many millions of great and small fishes are every year taken yet the next we expect to be served with as great a number god giving these creatures the sea for their proper habitation and providing suitable provision for them in that element where neither seedtime nor harvest yet all these wait upon him psalm  0    and he gives them their meat in due season his wisdom in that wise and beautiful order to be observed among these brutal creatures the several kinds knowing their coming and their going time and their loving to frequent one place of the water more than mother tho both under the same climate their going forth all of them by bands tho they have no king overseer or ruler these squammosae cobortes tho ot governed by principles of reason yet by their natural instinct being reasonably acted each to their proper ends for the maintenance and preservation of their several kinds give occasion to reasonable man to acknowledge admire and adore the infinite wisdom of his and their maker here also the goodness of god is to be observed in this that all these e given for the service of man that not only our tables should be furnished with the creatures that reath in the same element with us but also with these that live in another and seeing all these are as it we sacrificed for our use romans     should we not present our selv souls and bodies living sacrifices holy and acceptable u god which is our reasonable service seeing that g has made man to have dominion over the beasts the field the fowls of the air and the fishes of t sea should we not gratefully show forth his prai and say with all the wise observers of providence psalm   lord our lord how excellent is thy name in all  earth    it is the fishing only which makes this countr any way desirable else it would be very unpleasant liing there hec boeth hist as boeth of old did observe quorum o universae in piscibus sole arefactis quas quotannis ad eos cedentes hollandi zelandi ac germani aliarumque rer vulgarium permutatione mercantur yea if we abstra from their fishingtrade in many places there cot not be any living at all they not having fields eith for cornland or grazing but they trading  fishes with foreign merchants who import man goods for the more comfortable living of the countre their coming in the summer is very refreshful to all t inhabitants the thoughts and expectation of which the winter does not a little revive them when the shall enjoy some better fare than what their countre does afford when hamburghliquors and commodties shall be brought to their doors which being epected and desired may occasion sometimes their taing of a larger cup they knowing that the booths w not always stand open    it is to be observed that still the further nor we go non omnis fert omniae tellus the fishes are to be had in greater aboundanc in zetland more than in orkney and in island to the north of zetland more than in either the inhabitan there mostly living upon fishes and again we man nottice as there is not such a plenty of fishes in orkn as in zetland yet there is a greater of corn and  in zetland there is more corn than in island for i island they have little if any corn as the product of their country as some in zetland did inform me who ave conversed with these that had been there therefor the commonalty generally make use of dried ishes beaten small in stead of bread as boeth hinteth t vltra schethlandicas aliae quaedam insulae boeth hist quae pisces efactos ac sole induratos pistillo contundunt mox admista qua in pastillos componunt atque ad focum torrent qui illis nis est which shows us the great wisdom of god n his works of providence who bestows not all blessings upon every nation but when he denies r gives less of one blessing to one nation or counrey he allows them more of another which is also often observed with respect to particular persons this variety likewise shows the necessity and advanage of one nation or kingdoms trading with another    the fishingtrade is very lucrative and eniching to these who closely follow it it is commonly said that it is the fishing which first raised the neherlands to that pitch of grandeur and wealth which ow they have arrived at hence some historians call the fishery the goldmine of holland and that by their fishing especially in the british seas and if it were ot so very gainful what would make them every year equip such a numerous fleet of several hundreds of bushes under the guard and protection of their convoyes but that they know the zetland seas makes their mills to go therefore they do so warmly pursue this trade and encourage the udertakers thereof and so it is with the hamburgers and other merchants especially in the hans towns who trading here during the summer season return home in august or september they not only with fishes serving their respective cities but by sending them also up the country do make a good market which engages and encourages them to return every year and follow the same trade    the consideration of this great gain that dot redound to the trading merchants has of late anmated some gentlemen and others in zetland t enter into a society or company for trading in fishes that whereas strangers make such a good hand wit their fishes they may as well consult their own profit and gain by promoting of that trade which tends so much to the enriching of others especiall seeing they can do it with far less trouble and expense when here at home where the fishes are to b had which when taken and prepared may be sn abroad for sale to foreign markets whereas the hamburgers and others which come here are obliged to tarry from home through the summer waiting for their lading    it has been thought very strange by many that our own fishing for which we have so great and so inviting advantages beyond others should yet b so much neglected by our selves and left to the improvement of strangers who reap vast gain from it and as this deserves the consideration of the government so it might be expected that the late disappointment in the holy and wise providence of this naions noble and generous attempt to have settled  foreign plantation for raising us from the dunghil of contempt and poverty and advancing our wealth and trade will excite both these worthy undertaker and others to employ their stocks and endeavors i searching after and digging these mines of the ocean nearer home and profiting by these blessings which providence has brought to our very doors especially since thereby not only would a number of able seame be yearly trained for the use and service of the nation and the nation thereby put in a better capacity for undertaking and supporting greater projects o trade in the more remote parts of the world bu likewise many poor people would be employed wh are ready to starve and it is more reasonable w should fish in our own seas than for strangers so to  and i do greatly question if the hollanders mburgers or others would so permit us to fish in y seas so nigh to their land depending on their veraignty as we do them  and for this end shiping would be encouraged  the government and trading merchants as the llanders do an instance whereof we had when in tland a holland ship came into brassa sound from sing about the fair isle waiting for the east india et having in her wine brandy victuals etc for ir use that they might be refreshed before they ived at their port and this the trading company glect not ordinarily to do which shows they are at encouragers of trade and for the encourag of trade taxations imposed upon shiping should  easy especially now when the trade is so low t many merchants and shipmasters after they e hazarded their lives and their all do return sers home for if otherwise no wonder that all ncerned in trade be dispirited and discouraged in empting any thing that is noble which might tend  the nations public good  chap x concerning pightland firth the several tides which meet there the danger of passage etc the noise that pightland firth makes among many who only have heard thereof as being noted and nous for its danger to passengers concerning pightland firth and the causes ich concur to render it so awakened us more parularly to enquire concerning it which we had oprtunity to do in our return from zetland by orkney to caithness and therefore seeing we passed it in voyage i shall not altogether pass it in this narrati but communicate to the inquisitive what i kn either from my own or others observation anent i  why so called this firth is commonly called pictland pightland penthland firth doubtless from the picts whose kidom of old orkney was divided by this firth fr the continent of scotland blaw in his atlas or graphy tells us of a certain tradition showing how came first to be so denominated that the picts o time being defeat by the scots who pursued victory unto caithness and dungisby head where vanquished remnant so hotly pursued not judg themselves safe were forced to take boats and go o the firth to orkney but the orkney men conveen upon the alarm of their landing did so warmly ceive them with a sharp conflict that the picts w obliged to retire and take themselves to their b again with which they going off and not acquain with the running of the tides they all perish upon which sad catastrophe so fatal to the pictish tion this firth ever since was called pictland or piland firth buchanan calls it penthland firth as it commonly pronounced from one penthvs who this penthus was our historian has not b pleased to impart unto us buch hist l   nam penthlandici montes fretum penthlandicum a pentho non a picto composita vt possunt some historians relate that the picts com first out of germany into orkney which they inhabi for a season thence they passed over to caithness  other parts of the north of scotland so that he this firth is called pictland firth  the firth is commonly said to be    miles bro and i think they are but short its breadth and what coasts it washes but this may be bundantly compensed by the danger of the passag it is bounded on the north by the isles of orkney  on the south by dungisbyhead in caithness to west is the deucaledonian ocean whence the fl comes and to the east is the german ocean whence  ebb runs the landing places are burwick  southermost point of southrnalsha in orkney d dungisbyhead the northernmost in caithness john grot house called o john grotts house the northermost house in tland the man who now lives in it and keeps nn there is called john grot who says this house h been in the possession of his predecessors of that e for some hundreds of years which nae of  is frequent in caithness upon the sand by john ots house are found many small pleasant buckies and lls beautified with diverse colors which some  to put upon a string as beeds and account much for their rarity it is also observed of these shells varietates delectat t not one can be found altogether like another and on the review of the parcel i had i discerned some ference among them which variety renders them  more beautiful  in the firth are the sles of swinna stroma and pightlandrries the isles of swinna pightland skerries and stroma in the firth from burwick to the westnorthwest lies inna one of the isles of orkney a little sle where are some inhabitants who have a good fishing aut the isle but often with great danger not only cause it is in pightlandfirth where many tides do  but because of some dangerous wells or whirleols which are nigh unto it from burwick about      miles to southeast lies pightland skerries danger to seamen these skerries being in the mouth of  the firth to the east upon which both in ebb and od there goes a great sea therein is some good are but not inhabited save sometimes in the sumer season in the firth also is the isle of stroma little pleasant isle abounding with corns about a mile d an half long and half a mile broad and tho it be in  firth yet it is not reckoned as one of the isles of orkney because of its vicinity to caithness from which is but about   miles disant and this is the only isle which belongs unto caithness and is still under  jurisdiction of the lords of that country  besides the isles some skerries besides the isles there are also some skerries as fore burwick not half a mile from land there is o seen at an ebb upon which about   years ago w cast away a ship belonging to aberdeen and all  men in her as they say were lost  many tides go here although the sea in this firth flows and ebb twice in the    hours as it does in other places  there is a meeting of many tides here which runni contrary one to another cause that great rage and a were a conflict of waters which is terrible to beho and dangerous to engage with what is the numb of these tides cannot well be conescended upon some say    others    and others    blaw in  geography hinteth at this and the reason thereof she ing that the sea running among the orkney isles  thereby restrained and made to go through the  as so many waterspouts which meeting in this fi render it so formidable and dangerous but beca of the pertinency and elegancy of the historian up this head geogra elavi de freto pentlandiae i shall give his own words fret hoc navigantibus formidabile neque nisi sta temporibus quanquam positis ventis trajectui o portunum causa est cum aestus maris quotidie a se tentrionibus incitetur in his locis orchadas circu fusus iisque imerfusus hic primum objectu terrar coercetur unde vis illa immensa aquarum multis  nalibus insulas illas permeans dein reliquo mari  hoc freto effusa luctantibus etiam maris vergivii orientalis undis formidabiles aquarum vortices cu summo navium periculo creat and indeed wh we see the many impetuous tides coming out into t firth from among the isles of orkney each beari that course to which they are determined by the la and isles they wash and beat upon we will not judge strange that there should be such a meeting of tides  this firth for as some express it every craiglug makes a new tide and many craigs and lugs are there here  hence it is clear that the tide will run with a greater rapidity and force in some places then in others the tide stronger in some places then in others as when we pass that part of the firth where we meet with the tide in the ebb running off the sides of pightland skerries from south east down into the swelchie of stroma then the men most ly their oars and work hard lest they be born down into the swelchie a dangerous place when also we are   or   miles from cathnes there is another such rapid current comeing from the south of dungisbay head out of murray firth running upon stroma both into the swelchie on the north and into the merriemen of mey on the south end of the isle in our passage through this current for half an hour we made not as we could observe one foot of way tho there were   men tugging at the oars and no wind blowing and in all probability we had been carried down upon stroma if an able man a passenger had not taken ane oar so that then there were   oars upon our starboard side hence in some places there is a swift and in others a soft running tide which the boatmen being well acquainted with they will sometimes rest from their hard labor and refresh themselves a little  in our passage we see the currents we see the currents of the tides before we engage with them running like the torrents of some great rivers and in some places we will see the waters smooth and rough round about the reason whereof i know not if it be not because of some tides meeting there and as it were for some time quiescent in their center something like unto which i have observed in the meeting of several rivers in one place  in the firth are several places remarkable for their danger as the wells of swinna the wells of swinna dangerous  whereof some are on the east side and others on the west side of the isle they are like unto whirlepooles turning about with such a violence that if any boat come nigh unto them they will suck or draw it in the wells of swinna are trocht adiustar a puero sage agitat geogra blaevi and then turns it about until it be swallowed up but these wells are onl dangerous in a calm and seamen or fishers to prvent their danger thereby use when they come nea them to cast in an oar barrel or such like thing o which the wells closing they safely pass over the minister of the place told me that about  0 years ago there were two fisherboats there who coming nig the wells the men in the one boat seeing their danger one of these men thus afraid took hold of the other boat by them and both boats were swallowed up one of the ministers of zetland told me ther were three of these boats it so falling out that h passed the firth the very day after they perished ye notwithstanding of these dangers the fishers will no desist from fishing about these wells for they observ the nearer they come to them they have the fishe both greater better and more numerous so the fishes draw the men and the wells draw both  near to these skerries before barwick formerly mentioned are also   or   wells called the wells o tiftala and of tiftala only dangerous in a flood as the wells of swinna are in an ebb these wells as some do judge ar caused by an hiatus or ga in the earth below further i would offer this consideration that whereas all these wells are nigh unto ragged rocks constantly beat upon by the tides there may be some secre conveyances of the water into cavernes at the bottom of the rock from which they may pass into some other places where they rise again and that even in the same firth tho such places be unknown as it is storied of many rivers how they come to whirle and be so dangerous which fall into and run many miles below the earth and come out again in other places but that which i judge to be more simple is that several tides running upon the rocks and thence returning and meeting with other tides cause such a whirle as we see behind millwheels some of the water coming from and another part as it were appearing to return upon the wheel which cause such a whirle and no more does the whirles in the firth reuire a hiatus in the earth or a subterraneous passage hn the whirles in the mills water courses as for their swallowing up of boats which are no more seen this does not prove it for these boats may be broken beneath the water upon rocks or the like and the broken timber go to the sea of which there is enough ound cast a shore upon these isles but many things of his nature are hidden to us and we can only give our conjectures anent them  there is also in this firth the swelchie of stroma a very dangerous place at the north end of the isle of stroma swelchie of sroma where there is a meeting of several tides which causes the water to rage and make a dreadful noise heard at some distance as likewise the seabillows are raised high and appear white and frothy very terrible to behold especially if any storm be lying on falling unto which all passengers carefully labor to avoid as a gentleman related to me that once he was in great danger the seamen giving themselves over for lost tho three miles from the swelchie and that in a dead calm when within   or   pair of butts to stroma and tho so near land they had been carried down into and perished by this swelchie as they all laid their accounts if the lord had not speedily caused a northern wind to blow whereby they got hold of stroma  there is another dangerous place at the south end of this isle of stroma merry men of mey where also a great conflict of waters called the merry men of mey so called from the house of mey a gentlemans dwelling in caithness opposite to this isle and called merry men because of the leaping and danceing as it were of the waters there tho mirth and danceing be far from the minds of the seamen and passengers who shall be so unhappy as to fall in among them especially when any sea is going  seeing from what has been said this firth is sovery dangerous to pass no wonder that the mariners and others be very careful to lay hold on the fittest occasion for a safe passage seamen observe the tide in going over which they find to be a little before the turning of the tide when it is beginning to e on the shore but the flood is yet running in the se then they use to go off that so when they are or nigh unto the middle of the firth the tide man be upon the turn which causes for some time a st and quiet sea as to the running of the tides a the seamen are not so put to it in wrestling eith against flood or ebb buchanan speaking of the seas and the rapid tides elegantly expresses himself duae sunt tempestates quibus hae angustiae sunt supera les aut cum aestuum relapsu cessante undarum conflictu man tranquillatur aut ub pleno alveo aequot ad summum incrmenti pervenit languescente utrinque vi illa quae undas co citabat veluti receptui canente oceano procellis and vo cesis pelagi commoti molibus se velut in sua castra recipie tibus  what wind most avourable any wind they observe will take them over from burwick to caithness if tided right and the win not in s west or nigh to that point and so from caithness to burwick if not in n east or nigh to it b the n west wind they call the king of the firth n only i judge because it will both take them from caithness to orkney and from orkney to caithness but all because if it blow any thing it keeps them up in a ebb from falling into the wells of swinna the swelchie of stroma and the merry men of mey by tidin right also they can come over by the help of oars the there be no wind and at any time tho they observ not the tide they can pass from orkney to caithness if it blow a good gale from n east and so from caithness to orkney if the like blow from s wes the boatmen who use to pass the firth from their experience know it best and can avoid the swell of sea when persons of greater skill cannot do it  no anchoring at no time is there any anchoring in this firth so if any through ignorance or otherwise attempt it with  a little time they must either cut their cables as me have done and be gone or else if their anchors  cables break not they will be ridden under he experience whereof one of our sips lately had h casting anchor even in the mouth of the firth ere the tides are not so strong their anchor with a little time brake and they behoved to go to a  in a storm especially if it blow from s

caithness and stroma the house of mey a myth to seamen r they carefully fix their eyes upon the lums or himney heads of this house which if they lose sight  then they are too near caithness and so ready to run on sandbanks but if they get also sight of the oule then they are too near stroma and so may lect upon the rocks which ly off the south end of roma  hence we see they who go down to the

caithness and what we found be most remarkable there my discourse upon orkney and zetland being etended beyond what either was intended expected concerning caithness i shall therefore study to be the brie upon caithness as likewise seeing it is supposable the it may be better known then any of the former being upon the same continent with us what the is to be said thereupon i shall dispatch and sum up this one chapter  caithness is the northernmost province or shire  scotland its situation having pightland firth whereby it is divid from orkney on the north the entry to murray fir on the east sutherland and stranaver on the south at the deucatedonian ocean on the west it is from the high hill called the ord of caithness toward the south whereby it is divided from sutherland to dungish head about  0 miles long and from thurso on the west side to wick on the east side of the country  miles broad  as we were much in the dark about the etymolgy of orkney and zetland the reason of the name so no less are we here i that of caithness upon which blaw in his geograph gives us this notandum that many names  places are something strange whose original seem t be neither scottish irish danish or norvegian but u known uncertain and most ancient such as o bister loyibster robaster trumbuster and innumerabl others blavi geogra in caith caterum not multa locorum nomina peregrinu quid sapere quorum origo neque scoticum hibernicum danicum aut norvegicum quid referant sed ignotae incert and vetustissimae originis videntur qualia sunt orbiste lovibster roboster trumbuster and innumera ali and seeing such examples of names which are of a unknown original as are given by the historian d  end in ster i would add that the most of the names  places in this country do end in ster or star and go  between  0 and  0 in ster or star and about  0 in  as my informer who had been for some time in e country did reckon them of old sutherland th the same geographer was called cattey and its habitants catteigh and so likewise was caithness and anaver and in the irish sutherland to this day is lled catey and its inhabitants catigh so that catteyss is no other then the promontory or cape of the tes or sutherland which promontory is stretched t from the east or rather the north side says t geographer of the mountain of the ord blavi geogra adeo ut teyness nihil aliud sit quam promontorium cattae seu therlandiae quod promontorium a latere ortentali montis di praetenditur these cattaei are thought to be a peoe who arrived thither from germany who would ve more of this may consult the abovementioned uthor buchanan will have it to be called caithness because of its being mountainous but i know not if s reason will hold for the countries adjacent of herland and stranaver are more mountainous and ere are few high hills or mountains in it except t the south end thereof where it borders with suthernd but if it should be so called because it is the ness r promontory of the mountains the land by north ese mountains falling lower and running out in a romontory into the sea i judge it would hold better and be said with greater reason boethius also says at this country of old was called cornana but the eason thereof he gives not  the earls of caithness were among the ancientest  scotland the earl of caithness and in former times have been very potent in his corner as appears by the several old castles and laces of strength which then they were in possession f but now their memory is almost extinct the te earl george dying without issue the lord of glenchy now earl of braidatbin married the dowager who having purchased the earls estate the  parent heir judging himself thereb injured  gather together some of the country people recover his right but was defeat by gnc from the field they went to the bar and debated  matter there whereupon the lords gave forth t sentence that glenorchy should enjoy the estate  the heir should have the honors and an alim allowed him by glenorchy during his life the h having died about a year ago the heiress his sis succeeds to the honors and is in a very mean contion living in a place where the former earls used keep their hucks so to this ancient and honoable family of the earls of caithness there is almo put in holy providence a period and close the who had four great houses in this country like places for pleasure and convenience and castles f strength now in their heirs enjoy none of them the are ruinous and one is possessed by a stranger  likewise there are several other ruinous houses to  seen here who have spewed out their possessours  confirming that common observation that s committed by the inhabitants is as gunpowder lai to the foundations of their houses which quickl overturneth them when it pleases a righteous go to fire the train  the late earls of the name of sinclar the late earls of caithness were of the name o sinclar of which name also are many gentlemen o the country who have bought considerable parts o the earls estate from the earl of braidalbin before the sinclars the earls were of the name o shine and before them were the haralds and before the haralds were the olas as the tradition goes  concerning which and the manner of their succession and the interruption made therein the country talk several things which i shall not trouble my reade with only i shall observe what is related by cambden a judicious antiquary that of old the earls of caithness were the same with the earls of orkney but at length were divided the eldest daughter of one mulisius being given in marriage to william de s claro vulgo seincler the kings pautler his posterity had this honor conferred on them of being earls of caithness  the country is pleasant and very fertile the country abounds with grass corn attel fishes so that here the cheapest market it the world abounding with grass and corn hence yearly there is a great quantity of victual exported as an     there were   000 bolls embarked and taken out for which end it is much frequented by barks from the firth clyde and other places for ordinarily when there is no scarcity or dearth the meal is sold here at   or   or at most   merks per boll the cattle and fishes also are to be had very cheap as good kine often in the shambles such as the country does afford for   or   shall sterling and sometimes they say for   so that as i have heard some of the more intelligent inhabitants observe that here is the cheapest market in the world and the gentlemen can live better upon  000 merks gentlemen live well then they can do in the south upon  000 per annum who may improve their stocks to as great if not a greater advantage than in any other place in scotland for they may save their rents having within themselves what provision is necessary for their table and may sell much store every year what to the inhabitants in the country for their own use or for salting and sending abroad and what to drovers who take them south and it is observable that if any buy a piece of land only what is arable is accounted for as for what serves for pasture they use not to take nottice of tho upon that consideration they may value their acres at a greater rate in the way between thurso and dunnot we saw much low ground overblown with sand for two miles back from the sea which formerly not many years since was a pleasant meadow  ten parishes here there are  0 parishes in this country   of which can be served with ministers not having the irish language few of the people there speaking it but the other five cannot be supplied otherwise then by ministers understanding irish in some of these parishe there being very few who have any knowledge of ou language many speak irish and some of the ministers are obliged t preach both in english and irish for the edification of all some of the parishes are very wide and populous which tends to the increase of ignorance among many the ministers not being able to overtake their work some churches also are ruinous for when heritours are not friends to the work of god or cannot agree among themselves as to the concerting of suitable measures for putting or keeping things which concern the parish in order it uses to go ill with ministers as to their external accommodation and with churches as to their repair  the principal towns the two principal towns in the country are wick and thurso wick is a royal burgh on the east side of the country washen by the german ocean at the mouth of murray firth by the side of which runs a small river at the mouth of the river there is a harbor for boats or barks to ly in which they come into at full sea but this harbor is not so much frequented as another about a mile to the northeast of wick where they judge the boats do ly safer opposite to wick lies thurso at    miles distance on the west side of the country which tho it enjoy not the privilege of a royal burgh yet it is more populous then wick and has better buildings in it by the east side of the town runs a small river called the water of thurso in the water of thurso many good salmond taken and how they have the best church in the country well furnished and kept in good order  in the water of thurso there is good salmondfishing which they take two ways one is by crues or creels with crossed or barred doors going from the one side of the water to the other so framed that they suffer the fishes to go in but not to go out out of which sometimes they will take several horses burdens of fish the other way they take them is by a net where with they fish a pool which lies a little below the crues and is about a pair of buts in length they having spread the net upon the bank which is long enough to reach the breadth of the water they go in with it and one man on each side drawing it down the pool it is followed with    or  0 men going in a breast behind it with long staves or poles in their hands wherewith they keep the net to the ground and loose it when any way entangled the pool in some places will rise to the height of the breasts of the waders but there is no danger so they bring down the net softly and warily to the mouth of an enclosure which they call a stem into which the fishes are driven where the fishers standing with this larger net others take a lesser net and going therewith into the stem catch the fishes so enclosed that scarce one can escape for up the water they cannot run because of the larger net and neither down can they go because of the stem or stones laid together in form of a wall we saw as we could conjecture at one draught upwards of  00 good salmonds taken and these who have this fishing told us that   years ago they took  00 at a draught and going through the pool at the same time with the net again they catched other  00 which salmond for the most part they salt in barrels and sends abroad it is also to be observed that the salmond keep this water of thurso all the year over and in the winter season in frost and snow if you break the ice they are to be had the pool is but about half a mile up the water from thurso  there are several waters or rivers in the country as thurso wick dumbeth rice force several waters here and beradel but they are all small and indeed there is no great river all the way from caithness till we come to ness running by inverness in murray over which is a strong bridge lately built consisting of   arches which rive is remarkable for this that it never freezeth tho the frost be most vehement yea if then vow bring a horse unto the river the river of ness the iceacles will melt at his feet in the space of time that he is drinking the river comes from a loch called lochness which also has the same property   or   miles to the west of inverness thi river i make mention of tho not it caithness it being the first considerable one having any thing of a strong and regular bridge which we passed in our return  some trees there are some trees here but they are not so big as these which are further south even in sutherland particularly upon the water of beradel there is a pleasant strath full of small wood and there is a garden   or   miles to the southwest of thurso very pleasant and well furnished with fruit trees much commended by the inhabitants  rocks much frequented by fowls the rocks by the coasts are much frequented by fowls of various kinds as eagles hawks etc such as in orkney and zetland of which rocks there are long tracts for whereas in sutherland ros and murray the sea for the most part is boundd with the sand here it is bounded with the rocks which it washes and beats on and that almost round caithness from the ord to dungisbey head on the east and so by dunnot head and hoburn head to stranaver on the west except a few creeks or bays several of which are very convenient for anchoring especially in screbister bay a little to the north west of thurso there is good anchoring ground where ships may safely ride without the fear of hazard by wind or tide the capes of land there making a still sea and defending the ships which as it were flee into their arms from raging and angry pightland firth there are here also some rocks lying a little off the land from which they are broken and disjoined which they call clets the same with the holms in orkney and zetland these clets are almost covered with seafowls one way they take these fowls is pleasant tho with great danger they take a line one way they take the fowls on the end of which they fasten some fishhooks love the hooks there is also a pock fastened and so from e top of the rock they let down the line thus furshed with pock and hooks striking the heads of the oung fowls in their nests with the pock upon which e fowls do all gape and cry as if it were their dame oming with meat to them and so lifting the line they t the hooks fall into their mouths which taking hold the fowls they become their prey  there are likewise several caves going from the a within the rocks caves in which the waves make a eadful noise such caves we had occasion to take noe of in our discourse upon orkney and zetland  especially there is a kind of fowls called snowflects which resort to this country in great numbers in fenary they are about the bigness of a sparrow fowls called snowflects but exeding fat and delicious they flee in flocks thousands  them together many of which the inhabitants do ll and make use of they use to go away in april d are thought to come from the west highlands hey have also a great plenty of moorfowls plovers  much if not more then in any place of scotland  the industry of the gentlemen here is to be much ommended for although from wick to dumbeth which is  miles long there be no harbor or bay the gentlements industry commendable but a connued tract of ragged hard and ironlike rocks wash by the sea yet there are several harbors forced here by art tho denied by nature and passages in many places like steps of stairs made from the top of the ock to the bottom where their fishboats do ly and y these passages do bring their fishes up to the top of e rocks where they salt and dry them in houses ade for the purpose whereby great gain does redound  the owners some making as much by their fishes  they do by their landrent  as in orkney and zetland there were several old happels which the superstitious zealots did frequent superstitions so is it likewise in caithness the ministers told me the is one in dunnot parish beside which there are abo  0 heaps of stones which the people coming to ta with them a stone and throw it into the heap boing themselves also thereunto nigh to it likewise there is a loch called st johns loch concerning which there goes a fabulous tradition that on st stephen day there was a pleasant meadow in that place when now the loch is and on st johns day thereafter was turned into this loch there is also another i the parish of rhae to which some do take their children if they be in distress and make   graves at the side of one another laying the child between them and so they try if the child will recover but the wa how they know tales superstitiones ludicras recitate est refutare i forbear to mention but they sa there is a chapel in the parish of konnesbie the northermost parish of all this country opposite to orkney which is yet more frequented then any of the former which some wildly superstitious frequent on some day about candlemass going about it on their bar knees and thence going to a water they cast some  it in handfuls over their heads and from the water t an alehouse where they use to fill themselves drunk and when going to these or at them they can scarce even tho threatened be prevailed with to speak t which hellish rites some are so addicted that the ministers judge it next to impossible to get them weane and brought there from but the vigilance and pains o ministers especially of late has through the blessing o god not been altogether without success which ol chapels both here and in orkney and zetland i think the government should cause to be rased which might prove as the taking away of the nest egg  the house of thurso by east the earls of caithness as hinted at before had several strong and convenient dwellings one about a short half mile from thurso called thurso by east now ruinous it has been built in the form of a court and the gates have been decored with cut stone work and the gardens avenues and office houses have been nform to the splendor of the house an honest country man observing the many great sins that had been committed about that house is said to have prected to one of the late earls its ruin and desolation saying that the cup of sin was filling and this house would shortly become a den of dragons using the scripture phrase and seeing there are no such creatures among us it shall be of foxes and according it was observed that a fox haunted it when ruinous few years after which stayed there till about   or  0 years ago when a part of the house was repaired this i had from one of the ministers of the country and another minister told me that before he bore this character he frequently shot rabbets there within the walls of the house  there are also other four castles upon one bay castle sinclar and girnego on e east side of the country nigh to wick which belonged to these earls the bay is called ricebay and   or   miles broad the entry whereof is to the east t dangerous for ships to come into because of the many blind rocks that ly therein upon the south side of the bay next to wick have been   strong castles ined to one another by a drawbridge called castle inclar and girnego the former has been the strongest house but the latter they ordinarily had their dwelling in their situation is upon a rock disjoined from the land vironed for the most part with the sea to which castles from the land they passed also by a bridge which was drawn up every night whence there was no access to them i found the year of god upon the lintel of a window in castlesinclar to be   0  which has been e year wherein this castle was built or at least repaired some account these two castles to be but one because of their vicinity they say there was much  committed here as drunkenness uncleanness etc or which a righteous god has turned them into a ainous heap opposite to castle sinclar and girnego on the other side of the bay is kice another castle castles of kice beradel and hakergil also ruinous on the west side of the bay is the ca of hakergil a strong house at present possessed by gentleman who has a great interest in the counti but is not descended of the family of caithness the are also the ruins of the old castle of beradel to be se situated on a rock near to the sea at the mouth of river of that name to which also they have pass from the land by a drawbridge such naturally stro situations for their houses they sought out of old t they might be the more secure and safe from all vlence nature as well as art contributing to their fortification  a bishop murdered of old about a short half mile to the west of thuiso a the ruins of an old castle where the bishop in the times of popery is said to have had his residence particularly there was one adam said to b the last bishop who lived in that house who having greatly oppreed the people by his rigorous exacting of the tith the people complained thereof to the earl who said in passion to have answered them go and see him and sup him too if you please whereupon they we to the bishops lodging and apprehended him a setting his house on fire they actually boiled hi and supped off the broth which being known quiry was made for the barbarous actours of this tragedy and they being apprehended were put to death so suffering condign punishment for this horrid villainy and this earl is not the only great person who has given forth an inconsiderate sentence upon which barbarous and inhumane actions have ensued buchanan writes this to have been about the year     in the days of alexand  d king of scots and says only that they having killed the monk who attended his and his servant buchan hist in vitam alex   they wounded himself and drawing him to the kitchen they set the house on fire about him a little to the west of this is the house of screbister the residence of the late bishops where i think their lordships had but a mean accommodation the revenues of the bishopric here are among the smallest in scotland the revenues of the bishopric small which they report thus came to pass one of the bishops at the reformation sold the churches revenues far below their value some say at    shill scotper boll to the earl knowing that but for a short time he could enjoy the same  there is a hill in the parish of wick called stonyhill the reason of which denomination is said to be this stony hill in the days of william king of scots      as buchan has it there was one harald earl of orkney and caithness who being offended at the bishop as having insinuared something to the king against him apprehended the bishop cutting out his tongue and putting out his eyes which being represented to the king he sent his forces into caithness and having defeat the earl in several engagements the earl fleeing was pursued and being apprehended his eyes were first put out and then he was hanged and all his male children were emasculated upon this hill which ever since has been called stonyhill  they told us several stones set set up for monuments there are several high great stones set up through the country and that ordinarily on hills about which are the rubbish of other stones which have served for some end there and probably have been places of pagan worship as we observed upon orkney in the parish of bower as we passed we saw an artificial mount ditched about of a small circumference it is like for the same purpose they have likewise the tradition of some picts houses which have been here of old the rubbish whereof is yet to be seen in the parish of latheran as a gentleman well acquainted with the country did inform me  in the parish of latheran we saw the foundation of a house said to be laid by a bastard son of the earl of caithness but never perfected foundation of a house laid but not perfected it is founded upon a rising ground nigh to the sea where there is a fair prospect of murray where it is reported the gentleman had his mistress who intended to build it there that so she might have a view of the house from muray and he at the house might see murray  dunnot head dunnot head stretching out into pightland firt is about a mile in breadth and   miles in circumfrence in it are several lochs and some good pastu for cattle but no inhabitants in it are to be ha good millstones and it is thought there is a lead mine there in several places in the parish of dunn there will no ratts live and if earth be brought ou thence to other places molested by them they will b quickly gone  the ord of caithness the ord which divides caithness from sutherland is a high mountain as the name ord which in iris signifies an height does imply down which ou way from caithness to sutherland does ly the road i but narrow and the descent steep and if any stumble thereupon they are in hazard of falling down a precipice into the sea at the bottom of the rock which is is very terrible to behold but who pass it for the more security use to lead their horses to the foot of the hill which is about a short mile in length and no other way there is from sutherland to caithness or from caithness to sutherland but this except we go    miles about but it might be made broader and safer with small expense  signs of rain and drought it is observed in caithness as an infallible sign almost when they see a mist or cloud lying down upon the foot of the hills that then a drought will follow but if such a mist or cloud be on the top thereof they thence certainly conclude there will be rain that day a loch wherein is a house built by robbers   in the parish of halkirk there is a loch as there are several lochs in the countrey within which loch are the ruins of an old house built they say by robbers that they might be the more safe and secure from the fears of being apprehended that which is most observable concerning this house is that there is not one foot of more ground then what is within the circumference of the foundation and upon which it stands hence either the water of the loch has washen away the prominent rock if there has been any through wasting time or if there was no part of the rock without the circumference of the foundation it is wonderful to consider how so nigh to the water the foundation has been got laid the water about the house being of a considerable depth and the extreme parts of the rock upon which the foundation stands not to give way and fail under the weight of the building which those who have seen this house are surprised at upon the loch they have boats which come closs to the walls of the house for the taking of fowls of diverse kinds as maws herons etc several thousands of which do frequent it having their nests in the ruinous walls  appendix having finished and brought to some issue this task improvement in communicating my remarks upon these remote northern places i shall now wind up all in some brief animadversions upon the whole in in order to a practical improvement  and  st we would seriously consider and ponder the wonderful mercy and grace of our god is      in sending the gospel to the isles afar off that these gentiles who have not formerly heard of his fame nor seen his glory should have the same declared among them that through the tender mercy of our god luke        the day spring from on high has visited and given light to us who sat in darkness and in the shadow of death he has not dealt so with every nation with every isle the greatest part of which are immersed and suffered to ly in the thick darkness of paganism v were among the first of the nations in these north parts of the world to whom was sent the word of the salvation and according to the computation oe our king donald was the first crowned head in t world that bowed to him who has on his thigh the name written king of kings and lord of lords o of zion has gone forth the law and the word of the lord from jerusalem and has traveled some thousands of miles northward to britain and the isle thereto belonging hence those places of our highly an early favored isle unaccessible to the valor of the roman legions tertull became subject to christ britannorum loca romany inaccessa is    0    christo subdita sunt o what reason have we then to listen to the evangelica prophets cali sing unto the lord a new song and hi praise from the end of the earth ye that go down to the sea and all that is therein the isles and the inhabitants thereof let them give glory unto the lord and declare his praise in the islands  that which may heighten the sense of this distinguishing mercy and love is that we enjoy this gospel in as great if not greater purity then any nation under heaven we have it set forth in its native simplicity without the painting and gaudie dress of humane inventions assembly conveened at edinb an     sess   calderw hist which our king james vi in his first and better days was not ashamed to declare in open assembly the ancient government of our church is restored and her assemblies allowed to sit under the shadow of lawful authority by one of which we were appointed to visit those northern isles and report unto them at their next annual meeting how matters relating to the kingdom of christ do stand in those remote corners that so proper methods may be concerted and taken by the delegated representatives of this national church for promoting the spiritual and eternal welfare of the inhabitants  tho we enjoy the clear light of the glorious gospel  christ yet are there many evils from which we are purged until this day for beside the abounding andals breaking out to the dishonor of god the eproach of religion and the grief of the godly ere are many superstitious fopperies charms heathish and popish rites to which some especially in ose isles are so much addicted that it proves a most difficult piece of work to the most zealous ministers get them reformed  as all should have it much upon their hearts that ere should be any such dreadful evils now remaining  all invested with authority civil or ecclesiastic t called to employ their utmost endeavors for the ter extrpation of all idolatrous monuments and rasing  old chapels so much abused and that conform to ct of assembly the government commanding the magistrates of these respective bounds so to do for un that this be ministers endeavors whither by dorine or discipline will be the less successful  which obstinacy of these poor deluded souls perting in their sin and folly shows the malice and btilty

that which gives great advantage to satan is the ameful ignorance that abounds in this day of gospel light this is to him an useful handle whereby  keeps his subjects under his empire in his hellish
