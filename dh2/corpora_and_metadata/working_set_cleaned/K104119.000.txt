the nunnery an elegy in imitation of the elegy in a churchyard  son pittore anche io  corregio london printed for r and j dodsley at tullyshead pall mall price sixpence  the nunnery retirements hour proclaims the tolling bell each sacred virgin follows its decree with meek submission seeks her lonely cell and leaves the grate to solitude and me now shows the sinking sun a fainter glare and silence through the convent reigns confessed save where some paleeyd novice wrapped in prayer heaves a deep groan and smites her guiltless breast save where in artless melancholy strains some eloisa whom soft passion moves absorpt in sorrow to the night complains for ever barred the abelard she loves within those ancient walls by moss overspread where the relenting sinner learns to weep each in her narrow bed till midnight laid the gentle daughters of devotion sleep no stings of conscience goad their easy breast no unrepented crimes their slumbers fright no mournful dreams invade their peaceful rest nor shrouded specter stalk before their sight the endearing scenes of life they all forego even hymens torch for them must never blaze the husbands fond embrace they never shall know nor view their image in their childrens face often did they steal the flowery robe of may to deck the altar and the shrines around how fervent did they chant the pious lay while the deep organ swelled the sacred sound let not the gay coquette with jest profane mock their veiled life and destiny severe nor worldly beauty with a sneer disdain the humble duties of the cloistered fair the glistning eye the halfseen breast of snow the coral lip the clear vermilion bloom awaits alike the inexorable foe the paths of pleasure lead but to the tomb forgive ye fair whom britains sons admire if this her meanest bard incur your blame while he devotes not to your praise the lyre but to the convent dedicates his theme can these partake the sprightlymoving dance or in the garb of luxury appear can these ever pierce the lover with a glance or grace the tragic scene with pitys tear perhaps in this drear mansion are confined some whose accomplished beauty could impart the soft desire to the severest mind and wake to extacy the throbbing heart but splendid life in each allurement dressed attracts them not though flushed with youthful bloom stern penance chills the ardour of their breast and buries their ambition in this gloom full many a rivlet steals its gentle way unheard untasted by the thirsty swain full many a philomel attunes her lay and pours her plaintive melody in vain some veiled eliza like the clouded sun may here reside inglorious and unknown some like augusta might have reared a son to bless a nation and adorn a throne from flattrys lip to drink the sweets of praise in wit and charms with other belles to vie in circles to attract the partial gaze and view their beauty in the admirers eye their lot forbids nor does alone remove the thirst of praise but even their vices chains forbids through follys labyrinth to rove and yield to pleasure the unheeded reins to raise mid hymens joys domestic strife or seek that converse which they ought to shun to break the sacred ties of married life and give to many what they vowed to one far from the bustle of the splendid throng they tread obscuritys sequestered vale where the white hours glide silently along smooth as the stream when sleeps the breezy gale yet though they are sprinkled with ethereal dew with blooming wreaths by hands of seraphs crowned though heavens eternal splendors burst to view and harps celestial to their ear resound still grateful memory paints the absent friend not even the world to their remembrance dies their midnight orisons to heaven ascend to stop the bolt descending from the skies for who entranced in visions from above the thought of kindred razes from the mind feels in the soul no warm returning love for some endeared companion left behind from friendships breast reluctant they withdrew and with a sigh forsook their native air to their fond parents when they bad adieu gushed from their eye the tender filial tear for thee who mindful of the encloysterd fair do in these lines their artless tale relate if chance in distant times revolving year some kindred spirit shall enquire thy fate happily some aged vestal may reply often have we seen him ere auroras ray had faintly tinged with red the opening sky hasten to church and join the matin lay there at the tomb where eloisa lies he would read the inscription and her fate condole then in his breast as scenes of grief arise sigh the kind requiem to her gentle soul against yon pillar careless now he would lean smiling at what his wayward fancy moves now drooping wan and pensive would be seen as one abandoned by the fair he loves one morn i missed him in the aweful dome along the isle and in the sacristy another came nor yet beside the tomb nor at the font nor in the porch was he the next we heard which did our wonder move he was departed to return no more yet lest the sudden change we should reprove these lines he sent us from britannias shore what time in transport lost the naiad throng first caught their akensides enchanting lay and raptured fancy listened to the song of laureled whitehead and sweetplaintive gray the letter a vestal fair her name i may not unfold has planted in my breast the pleasing dart who by relentless vows if not controlled would own perchance a sympathy of heart the growing passion impotent to quell severe discretion urged me to retreat now at my native rural home i dwell where contemplation keeps her lonely seat seek not to draw me from this still abode where the kind muses to my aid repair and when the thoughts of hapless love corrode check the deep sigh and wipe the trickling tear finis
