the rival sisters  a tragedy   scelerate revertere theseu flecte ratem numerum non habet illa suum ovid adapted for theatrical representation as performed at the theater royal drury lane  regulated from the promptbook by permission of the manager  the lines distinguished by inverted commas are omitted in the representation and those printed in italics are additions  london printed by john bell british library strand bookseller to his royal highness the prince of wales  mdcc xciii  preface there is perhaps nothing more uninteresting than the generality of those preliminary discourses in which authors too frequently lay out much of their time in talking of themselves and their works the importance of a man to himself is fully displayed while the reader yawns over the tedious page or laughs at the rhetoric that would persuade him he ought to be pleased the present writer has been unwilling upon almost all occasions to conform to a practice which he saw attended with so little success but the following tragedy is sent into the worla in a manner that may require some explanation it has not gone through the siery trial of the theater nor is it recommended by the favorable decision of an audience the pomp of splendid scenery and the illusions of the skilful performer have not awakened the public attention  the play ventures abroad without having previously gained by the advantages of representation a character which in the leisure of the closet is not always supported but this circumstance while it raises no expectation may on the other hand excite a prejudice not casy to be sarmounted if it be of any value why was it not produced in the usual form of a public exhibition the reasons that influenced the author would lead to a long and frivolous detail whatever those reasons were whether caprice whim peevishness or delicacy they were of weight to determine his conduct his work however does not go forth with accusations of any kind against the proprietors of either theater it makes no appeal from their judgment the fact is it never was in their hands and where there was no refusal there can be no room for complaint  it need not be dissambled that the play was written with a view to the stage it was begun and finished in the summer      at a time when the author was disabled by a nervous disorder in his eyes from pursuing a more important work which has engaged several years of his life it was painful to read and he found amusement necessary he walked in green fields made verses and threw them upon paper in characters almost illegible for a subject he was not long at a less he remembered that madame de sevigne vide her letter  st april      mentions her having attended the representation of ariane a tragedy by the younger corneille the play says that amiable writer though in its general style and conduct flat and insipid was notwithstanding followed by all paris not for the sake of the poetry but the actress la champmele whom she calls the greatest prodigy the stage ever beheld the others were disgusting but when the champmele entered the scene a murmur of applause ran through the theater every heart was interested and every eye dissolved in tears  when this country could with pride boast of an actress equally followed and perhaps with better reason it occurred that a tragedy with the beauties of the original but freed from it is defects might at such a season be acceptable to the public the defects which drew down the judgment of so enlightened a critic as madame de sevigne are pointed out with minute exactress by the judicious voltaire see his edition of corseilles works from that pleasing writer we learn that the tragedy in question still keeps it is rank upon the stage whenever an actress of eminence wishes for an opportunity to display her talents in a principal character the situation he observes is interesting and pathetic a princess who has done every thing for her hero who has delivered him from a cruel death and sacrificed all considerations for his sake who loves him generously who thinks herself loved in return and deserves to be so who finds herself at last abandoned by the man whom she adores and betrayed by a sister whom she also loved a woman thus situated says i voltaire forms the happiest subject that has come down to as from antiquity notwithstanding this general account voltaires observations which trace the author scene by scene show that madame de sevigne was not mistaken in her judgment  shall the present writer flatter himself that he has removed the vices of the first concoction and substituted what is better he has certainly endeavored to do it for this purpose a new fable was necessary the progress of the business required to be conducted in a different manner with more rapidity and without those languid scenes which weaken the interest and too often border upon the dialogue of comedy the characters were to be cast in a new mould and instead of definitions of the passions their conflict their vehemence and their various transitions were to be painted forth in higher coloring than are to be found in the french composition the reader therefore is not to expect a mere translation the author does not scruple to say that he entered into a competition with the original that he has aimed at a better tragedy and to use the words of a late elegant writer he hopes he has shown some invention though he has built upon another mans ground  but here again the question recurs if the new superstructure raised upon the old foundation has any merit why not produce it with all the advantage of that celebrated actress who it seems inspired the first design the plain truth shall be the answer when the piece was finished the author had his moments of selfapprobation and in his first ardour hinted to a friend that he intended to give it to the stage but selfapprobation did not last long  that glow of imagination which to speak the truth is sometimes heated into a pleasing delirium with its own work subsided by degrees and doubt and diffidence succeeded a play that might linger nine nights upon the stage was not the object of the authors ambition whether he has been able to execute any thing better he has not considered for a long time nor has he now courage to determine he has often said to himself in the words of tully nihil hue nisi perfectum ingenio elaboratum industria afferri oportere and after adopting in his own case so rigid a rule how shall he presume to say that the production of a summer can boast either of genius or the elaborate touches of industry  in this irresolute state of mind the authors respect for the public who have done him upon former occasions very particular honor increased his tmidity he was unwilling to appear a candidate for their favor when he was not sure of adding to their pleasure at present being to give an edition of such pieces as he has been able to produce he could not think of keeping back the only dramatic work left upon his hands he therefore sends it into the world an humble adventurer with one of his predecessors he says  va mon enfant prens ta fortune the play amused him while he was engaged in the writing of it and should the candid reader find an hour of leisure not entirely thrown away in the perusal the author will not think his time altogether misemployed he now dismisses the piece if not with indifference at least with resignation content to leave the honors of the theater to writers of more ambition than he possesses at present  non jam prima peto

tell me all and speak to me of theseus in vain i ask it though his name delights my listening ear yet you will never charm me with the loved praises of the godlike man on perianders name you often dwell in strains that in a heart not touched like mine might stir affection  not a word of theseus why silent thus  it is unkind reserve alas my sister thy unruffled temper knows not the tender luxury of love that joys to hear the object it adores approved admired of all when every tongue grows lavish in his praise then then with ecstacy the heart tuns over and with pride we listen  phae i have been just to theseus never wronged him his fame in arms has filled the nations round and purple victory in fields of death for him has often turned the doubtful scale  ari unkind ungenrous praise has no one told you his brave exploits the number of his battles but who can count them fame exalts her trump delighted with his name to swell the note and victory exulting claps her wings still proud to follow where he leads the way  phae so fame reports  with what unbounded rage her passions kindle  she alarms my fears  aside ari why that averted look of late my filter of late i have marked thee

sparkled in thy eye or dawned in mine could prompt the little passions of our sex we heard each others praise and envy slept and sure had theseus though with boundless ardour i now must love him to distraction love him yet if my theseus had first sixd on thee i could i think i could have seen you happy in his loved aims and hero as he is i had resigned him to you  why that sigh phaedra way fall

evil hour i sailed from greece would i had never embarked  ari my heart dies in me  say what new event  theseus explain and tell me tell me all  the oh i was born to be the unceasing curse of ariadnes

some new concern to me unknown your presence is required it is perianders order  the i obey  ari what may this mean yet theseus ere you go   the my friend will tell each circumstance from him you will

has promised still to shield thy suffering virtue  phae i dread some mischief ariadne here wait my return i will follow to the palace and bring the earliest tidings of his fate  exit ari my heart is chilled with fear what dark event  can periander  no dishonor never will stain his name  and yet that awful pause those looks with grief overwhelmed  perit yes grief indeed sits heavy at my heart   ari reveal the cause give me to know the worst this dread suspense   perit oh that in silence i could ever hide from you from all and in oblivion bury what here is lodged and shakes my soul with horror  ari with horror wherefore is not theseus safe does not his country claim him does not greece with open arms expect him does not athens send you with orders to demand us both  perit from thence your dangers rise the sons of athens a quick inconstant fluctuating race   ari yet ever wise heroic generous brave all soul all energy do they oppose our nuptial union do they still retain their old hostility do they exclude an alien princess from the throne of athens if such their will take take the sovereign sway the imperial diadem the pomp of state let theseus to his fathers rights succeed and reign alone make me his wedded wise it is all i ask the gods can grant no more thrones sceptres grandeur love can scorn you all  perit unhappy theseus by disastrous fate doomed to betray such excellence to see the fairest gift of heaven and spurn it from him  aside ari you answer not speak and resolve my doubts pity a heart too tenderly alive and wild with fear that throbs that aches like mine thy pure exalted mild will tower above the arts of mean equivocating phrase you will not deceive a fond a faithful woman  perit none should deceive you none you will forgive my hesitating fears i would not wound that tender frame with aught that may alarm you for thee my mind misgives the fear that awes me pays homage to your virtue  ari and does greece reject the love i proffer  perit no all greece reveres your honored name the athenian slate by me demands your liberty in terms of earnest import i have urged their claim but periander  to his ardent spirit you are no stranger  he no sooner heard the name of ariadne than with fiercest rage  perhaps you know the cause  with high disdain he spurned at the demand some hidden motive  it is love perhaps  you will forgive my boldness  it is love perhaps that prompts the stern reply should i presume once more to urge the claim theseus that moment must embark for crete so says the king he will not brook a rival you will see you lover torn by russians from you you will see the ship bound swiftly over the waves in vain you will shriek in vain extend your arms and call on theseus lost  ari that savage purpose the soul of periander will disdain  perit what will not love persuade love made you fly your fathers court and love may teach a monarch to break all bonds and tower above the laws  ari if this be what alarms you   perit theseus life once more depends on thee   ari to save that life is there an enterprise a scene of danger that ariadne will not dare to meet  perit your wondrous daring on the wings of same has reached the nations round but now alas one only way is left  ari direct me to it  perit to periander lend a gracious ear for thee he sighs for thee his vows ascend his throne awaits thee the imperial crown   ari sir do you know me   perit princess here to reign in this fair island    ari do you know the spirit that rules this breast end over informs my soul  perit forgive the zeal that prompts me to this office the king intensely loves and in a base degenerate world frem which all truth is fled he still may faithful prove to worth like thine consult with theseus he can best advise you  ari consult with theseus ask his kind consent that i may prove a traitress to my vows resign my theseus with every grace with every laurel crowned the lovers softness and the warriers sire  sir for this counsel for this generous care accept my thanks  you are too much alarmed  resign my theseus  oh the gods have formed him with every virtue that adorns the hero with valor to incite the soldiers wonder with every grace to charm the heart of woman oh none will rival him twill be the pride of periander it is his highest glory that theseus fld for shelter to his throne and met protection here  perit i have been to blame perhaps i urge too far  princess farewell may the benignant gods watch all your ways  exit ari your fears are vain each gloomy cloud shall vanish or tinged with orient beams of smiling fortune with added luster gild our various day while over our heads hymen shall wave his torch sooth all our cares and brighten every joy  exeunt act iii scene i enter ariande and theseus ariadne oh look not thus those eyes that glare so pale those sighs that heave as they would burst your heart affright my soul and kill me with despair oh banish all thy doubts and let those eyes smile as when first they beamed their softness on me   the alas i am doomed to mourn my thread of life was steeped in tears and must for ever run black and discolored with the worst of woes   ari can thy great heart thus shrink appalled with fear theseus i never saw thee thus before  the our days of rapture and of promised joy far hence are fled   ari no on their rosy wings the hours of joy and ever new delight come smiling on is this a time for fear when all is gay serenity around us and fortune opens all her brightest scenes   the too soon that scene with lowering clouds deformed will show the sad reverse you little know how periander with resistless fury breaks through all bounds his passions scorn restraint and what he wills his vehemence of soul pursues with fierce with unremitting ardour to his wild fury all must yield obedience  ari his reign has ever been both mild and just fair virtue like some god that rules the storm still calms the warring elements within him and moderation with her golden curb guides all his actions  the yet there is an impulse which with the whirlwinds unresisted rage roots up each virtue and lays waste the soul love reigns a lawless tyrant in his heart for thee he sighs and sure that matchless beauty may well inflame the passions of a prince who with a diadem can deck thy brow  ari too well he knows the ties that bind us both knows youre all truth all constancy and love he knows the flame my virgin sighs have owned knows that for thee i left my native land fled from my friends and from my fathers palace and gave up all for thee and thinks he now his throne his diadem his purple pomp have charms of power to lure me from thy arms he knows his vows are lost in air thy heart is ariadnes throne  the his fiercest passions break forth at once like the deep cavernd fire all ties all tender motives must give way his resolutions sixd alas this very day unless for ever i renounce thy love his jealous rage sends me hence bound in chains to die a victim on the cretan shore  ari he will not dare it no so black an outrage his heart will never conceive should he persist should malice goad him on i too can fly this barbarous shore with unextinguishd love through every region every clime attend thee follow your fortunes if the fates ordain it even to my fathers court there prostrate fall and clasp his hand and bathe it with my tears nor cease with vehemence of grief to melt him till he release thee to these circling arms approve my choice and show thee to the people the adopted heir the rising sun of crete  the by yielding me his rival is destroyed and by that act his proud ambition hopes to sooth your fathers irritated pride and mould him to his wish  ari can periander harbor that black intent and does he mean to prove at first a villain and a murderer and then aspire to ariadnes love no theseus no he will not stoop so vilely i have heard you often commend him often my sister employs whole hours with rapture in his praise he is her constant theme her partial voice even above thine exalts his favorite name she dwells on each particular in peace his milder virtues his great fame in arms how when he talks fond admiration listens and each bright princess hears him and adores   the not envys self however his pride inflamed may deal with me can overshade his glory rnown in war is his the softer virtues of mild humanity adorn his name the polihd arts of peace and every muse attune to finer sentiments his soul his throne is fixed upon the firmest basis of wisdom and of justice there to shine the partner of his heart his soft associate in that bright scene of glory well may prompt in every neighboring state the virgins sigh and wake the ambition of each monarchs daughter   ari the strain the rapture that to me in secret my sister phaedra pours the livelong day enamored of his name perchance you have heard her and marked the heaving sigh and seen the blush that glowed with conscious crimson on her cheek oh if she cherishes the tender flame with maiden coyness veiled and pines in love beauty like here is may fire a monarchs heart and periander without shame or guilt without a crime may woe her to his arms to see her happy to behold my phaedra crowned with a monarchs and a peoples love would be the pride of ariadnes heart  the oh it were misery the worst of woes  aside ari why do you start why that averted look if you approve their nuptials freely tell me with periander i can plead her cause paint forth each charm of that accomplished mind till the king glow with rapture at the sound  the oh this would plunge me in the worst despair aside it must not be  has not perithous told you   ari perithous is your friend  perhaps to draw the tie still closer you would see him blessed in phaedras arms  tell me your inmost thoughts if such your will what will i not atempt to sooth to dear delight a mind like thine phaedra will listen to me mutual love has so endeared us from our tenderest years has so increased and with our growth kept pace that we have had one wish one heart one mind  my voice with phaedra will have all the power of soft persuasion her exalted merit will bless your friend and brighten all his days  the oh the bare image fires my brain to madness aside alas this dream of happiness   ari what means that sudden cloud and why that laboring sigh oh let my sister to perithous vows yield her consent and bless him with her beauty together then well seek the realms of greece there in sweet union see our growing loves spring with new rapture share each others bliss and by imparting multiply our joys  enter archon arc with thee fair princess periander craves another interview he enters now the palace garden  ari does he there require my presence  arc where you deign to give him audience he will attend you  the it were best go forth his virtues claim respect and oh remember my fate my happiness on thee depend  ari trust ariadne trust your fate with me  aside arc the cretan princess with resistless passion inflames his fierce desires my boding fears foresee some dire event  the a glance from her will sooth his rage and all may still be well when love resistless fires the noble mind the effects though sudden from that generous source are often excused the errors of our nature the tender weakness of the human heart  arc errors that influence the public weal his rank prohibits  let his vices be if vices he must have obscure and private unfelt by men leaving no trace behind it were unjust that his unbounded fury should tear thee from the arms of her you love  the but when a monarch  ha perithons comes  enter perithous perit theseus i sought thee  archon does your king relent or must confedrate greece send forth her fleets and armies to support her rights  arc the miseries of war my feeble voice shall labor to prevent theseus farewell archon is still your friend with ariadne ere long i trust you may revisit greece  exit the with her revisit greece why all this zeal for ariadne who has tampered with him why not convey her to her fathers court why not invite her to the throne of naxos why all this busy this officious care to torture me to foil his sovereigns love to send far hence the idol of his heart and blend her fate with mine  perit her fate with thine so close is blended nothing can divide them truth honor justice gratitude combine each tender sentiment they form a chain an adamantine chain indissoluble firm and strong as that which from the throne of jove hangs down to draw to harmony and union this universal frame  the it this my friend  perit your friend who scorns to flatter who dares avow the emotions of his heart oh theseus we have long together walked the paths of virtue upright firm in honor and shall we now decline and shall we now wiih fraud with perfidy with blackest perfidy for ever damn our names   the this stern reproof is not the language the time now demands it is thine my friend to soften my distress to pour the balm of comfort over my sorrows and sooth the anguish of a wounded mind oh step between me and the keen reproaches of injured beauty save me from myself from ariadne save me   perit is it thus oh rash deluded man and is it thus with high disdain you spurn that rarest beauty that fond believing unsuspecting fair   the have you not painted to her dazzled fancy the splendour of a throne that here awaits her   perit so generous so unbounded is her love she seeks but thee thee only pomp and splendour are toys that sink and fade away before her   the then tell her all the truth tell her at once another flame is kindled in my heart and fate ordains she never can be mine   perit will that become perithous that the task thy friendship would impose must i proclaim to the astonished world my friends dishonor must i with cruelty with felon purpose approach that excellence that beauteous form and for her generous love for all her virtue fix in her tender breast the sharpest pang with which ingratitude can stab the heart  the why will thou goad me thus it is cruelty it is malice in disguise  forbear forbear assist your friend in the soft cause of love involuntary love that holds enslaved the fettered will  perit involuntary love beware beware of the deceitful garb that vice too often assumes  there is not a purpose prompting to evil deeds that dares appear in it is own native form the first approach with bland allurements with insidious mien wears the delusive semblance of some virtue the siren spreads her charms and fancy lends her thousand hues to deck the lurking crime opinion changes it is no longer guilt it is amiable weakness generous frailty involuntary error on we rush by fatal error led and thus the language the sophistry of vice deludes us all  the perithous it is in vain in vain you strive by subtle maxims and by pedant reasoning to talk down love and mould it to your will it rages here like a close pentup fire and think thou tame advice can check it is course and soothe to rest the fever of the soul  perit and will thou thus by one ungenrous deed blast all thy laurels and give up at once to shame and infamy thy honored name  the wouldst thou destroy my peace of mind for ever  perit i would preserve it would thou still enjoy the attesting suffrage of the conscious heart the road is plain and level live with honor be all your deeds such as become a man it is that alone can give the unclouded spirit the pure serenity of inward peace all else is noisy fame the giddy shout of gazing multitudes that  expires and leaves our laurels and our martial glory to wither and decay by after times the roar of fond applause no more is heard the triumph ceases and the hero then fades to the eye the faithless man remains  the was it for this you spread your sails from greece to aggravate my sorrows  if a monarch woes  to his throne and bed if i resign her to imperial splend where is my guilt why will she not accept the bright reward that waits to crown her virtues  perit because like thee she is not prone to change  the why crue  pierce my very soul  perit because  knows not to betray  the disastrous fate and  ou have me fly from phaedras arms by every mn vow by every sacred tie by love itself my heart is here is she is my only source of present bliss my best my only earnest of future joy the idol of my soul should i desrt her can invention find midst all her stores a tint of specious coloring to varnish the deceit  perit it wants no varnish no specious coloring plain honest truth will justify the deed with open firmness go talk with phaeda tell her with remorse conscience has shown the horrors of your guilt tell her the  you breathe to aane were heard above recorded by the gods tell her if sti he sprads her fatal lure she takes a perjured traitor to her arms practiced in fraud who may again deceive tell her with equal guilt nor less abnord she joins to rob a  of her rights tell her that greece   the no more i will here no more assist my love it is there i ask your aid forget my same it is not worth my care  perit then go rush on devoted to destruction let hymen kindle his unhallowed torch clasped in each other arms enjoy your guilt renounce all sacred honor add your name to the bright list of those illustious worthies who have seduced by vile insidions arts the fond affections of the generous fair and in return for all her wondrous goodness leave the fair mourner to deplore her fate to pine in solitude and die at length of the slow pangs that rend the broken heart  the oh fortune fortune  wherefore was i born with a great heart that loves that honors virtue and yet thus fated to be passions slave  perit it is but one effort and you tower above the little frailties that debase your nature that were true victory worth all your conquests you triumph over yourself and lo behold the occasion offers  ariadne comes  the i must not see her now  perit by heaven you shall  the often loose your hold confusion shame and horror rage and despair distract and rend my soul it is you have fixed these scorpions in my breast  perit and yet   holding him the no more let midnight darkness hide me in some deep cave where i may dwell with madness far from the world far from a friend like thee  exit perit misguided man my friendship still shall save him  ari stay theseus stay does he avoid my presence why with that haste that wild disordered look   perit it is now the moment of suspended fate the gods assembled hold the uplifted balance and my friends peace all that is dear or sacred his fame and honor   ari the gods protect him still you need not fear all danger slies before him  perit while the king dains him here he knows to what excess a monarchs love   ari does that alarm his fear and does he therefore fly  ungenrous theseus and is it thus you judge of ariadne and yet perithous i will not upbraid him his tender sensibility of heart too quickly takes the alarm yet that alarm shows with what strong solicitude he loves my tears prevail and he may sail for greece this very moment periander granted  see where he comes he will confirm it all  perit it were not fit he should behold me here when apt occasion serves well meet again a heart like yours with every virtue fraught should be no more deceived i now withdraw  exit ari go tell my theseus all his fears are vain in love as well as war he still must triumph  perian if once again i trouble your retreat deem me not princess too importunate nor with indignant scorn reject a heart that throbs in every vein for you alone  ari scorn in your presence sir no mind can feel far other sentiments your martial glory and the mild feelings of your generous nature excite in every breast the crown you wear from virtues purest ray derives it is luster your subjects own a father in their king beneath your sway the wretched ever find a sure retreat at perianders court all hearts rejoice here misery dries her tear to me your kind humanity has given it is best protection for the generous act my heart overflows these tears attest my thanks each day beholds me bow to you with praise respect and gratitude  perian and must respect fruitless respect and distant cold regard be all my lot has heaven no other bliss in store for me unhappy royalty condemned to shine in solitary state with no fond tenderness of mutual love to sooth the heart and sweeten all it is cares without the soft society of love  ari for thee the gods reserve sublimer joys the happiness supreme of serving millions it is yours in war to guard a peoples rights in peace to spread one common bliss to all and feel the raptures of that best ambition mankind demands you glory is your call  perian ambition is the phrenzy of the soul the fierce insatiate avarice of glory that wades through blood and marks it is way with ruin and when it is toils are over what then remains but to look back through wide dispeopled realms where nature mourns over all the dreary waste and hears the widows and the orphans shrieks and sees each laurel wither at the groans and the deep curses of a ruined people vain efforts all vain the pursuit of glory unless bright beauty arm us for the field hail our return enhance the victors prize and love reward what love itself inspired   ari the vast renown that spread such luster round you like the bright sun that dims all meaner rays and makes a desert in the blue expanse will never want uplifted wondering eyes to gaze upon it from the neighboring states some blooming virgin some illustrious princess will yield with rapture to a monarchs love proud of a throne which virtue has adorned  perian that pewr is yours one kind indulgent glance one smile the harbinger of soft consent has bliss in store beyond the reach of fortune beyond ambitions wish  ari your pardon sir i must not hear you sigh and sigh in vain look round your isle where in it is fairest forms in all it is winning graces beauty decks your splendid court amidst the radiant train if none has touched your heart may i presume  perhaps you will think mine a too partial voice  if none attract you see where phaedra shines in every grace in each attractive charm of outward form and dignity of mind her rare perfections her unequalled virtue the mild affections of her generous heart her friendship firm in every instance tried transcend all praise in her pure virgin breast love never kindled yet his secret flame your voice may wake desires unfelt before with pride she will listen and may crown your vows with all the endearments of a love sincere and with her softer luster grace your throne  perian why cruel torture me with cold disdain with thee to reign were perianders glory  ari oh not for me that glory well you know this heart already is anothers right  perian there lies the precipice on which you tread by your own hand it is covered over with flowers your fall will first discover it  ari those words dark and mysterious    perian it were not fit that fond credulity should lead you on in gay  and in errors maze  the base deceive   ari who  what do thou mean   perian i mean to save you from his treacherous arts to place you on a throne beyond his reach where soul ingratitude will see her shafts fall powrles at your feet   ari cold tremors shoot  i know not why  through all my trembling frame   perian tender sincere are generous yourself you little know the arts of faithless man  ari explain unfold  you freeze my soul with horror  perian beware of theseus  ari how of theseus said thou  perian were i this day to send him hence a victim and you alone  your tears suspend my purpose twere vengeance due to perfidy like his  ari the vipertongue of slander wrongs him sir too well i know his worth  my hearts at peace  perian with fond enchantment the gay siren hope has lured you on a calm unruffled sea to trust a smiling sky and flattering gales too soon you will see that sky deformed with clouds too soon you will wonder at the gathering storm and look aghast at the deep lurking ruin where all your hopes must perish  ari still each word is wrapped in darkness  end this dread suspense or else my fluttering soul will soon forsake me and leave me at your feet a breathless corse  perian a former flame  restrain that wild surprise summon your strength  i speak his very words a former flame kindled long since in greece preys on his heart with slow consuming fires  ari does this become a monarch can your pride thus lowly stoop thus with a tale suborned to tempt the honor of this faithful breast  perian by every power that views the heart of man and dictates moral thoughts it is truth i utter last night admitted to a private audience he owned it all renounced your love for ever gave up his fair pretensions  ariadne your color changes and the gushing tear starts from your trembling eye   ari the very thought  though sure it cannot be  the very thought strikes to my heart like the cold hand of death  perian if still you doubt go charge him with his guilt he will allow it all  ari and if he does oh what a change in one disastrous day  perian your sat now calls for firm decisive measures i will no longer urge the ungrateful subject i leave you to collect your fluttering spirits i would not see your generous heart deceived  his guilt should rouse your noblest indignation now you may prove the greatness of your soul  exit ari if this be so  if theseus can be false is there on earth a wretch so cursed as i am  a former flame  ha think no more  that thought with ruin big shoots horror to my brain a former flame still rages in his soul  so said the king  who is the fatal fair where in what region does she hide her charms was it for her i saved him from destruction for her rebelled against my fathers power to give to her all that my heart adores can theseus thus  no yonder sun will sooner start from his orbit  yet wherefore shun my presence why all this day that stern averted look i am torn distracted tortured with these doubts and where oh where to fix  i think him still all truth all honor tenderness and love and yet perithous  it is all too plain all things conspire all things inform against him he will avow it  let me seek him straight unload my breast nnd charge him with my wrongs with indignation harrow up his soul tell all i have heard all that distracts my brain pour forth my rage pour forth my fondness too and perhaps prove him innocent at last  act iv scene i enter ariadne ariadne where ariadne where are now the hours that winged with rapture chased each others slight in one gay round of joy  where now the hopes that promised years of unextinguishd love  it is past  the dream is fled  the sun grows dim fair daylight turns to darkness  all within me is desolation horror and despair  and are his vows breathed in the face of heaven are all his oaths at once dispersed in air those eyes whose glance sent forth the melting soul were they too false  the tears with which he often bedewed his bosom were they taught to seign he shuns me still where does he lurk concealed  in all our haunts in each frequented grove ah groves too conscious of the traitors vows in vain i have sought him  does this hated rival has she seduced him to her amorous parley gods does she see him smile and hear that voice and does he sigh and languish at her feet enamored gaze and twine those arms around her hold traitor hold the gods forbid your love  those looks those smiles art mine  deluded maid mine are those vows that fond embrace is mine horror distraction  still it is but surmise that with these shadowings makes me tremble thus i still may wrong him  perianders fraud  it is he abuses my too credulous ear the tale may be suborned  i will not believe it  lost ariadne you believe too much where where is phaedra her unwearied friendship may still avert my ruin she may find the barbarous man and melt his heart to pity and yet she comes not  ha perithous here  he knows the worst  he can pronounce my doom  perit forgive me princess with officious zeal if i one more intrude the time no longer admits of wavering hesitating doubt the king enfetterd in the chains of love reject the claims of greece if hence you part you must with theseus steer your course for crete his resolutions fixed  ari does theseus know the impending danger  have you seen your friend  perit his great heart labors with a war of passions too big for utterance in the soldiers eye the silent tear stood trembling strong emotions convulsd his frame he knows your every virtue and rails in grief in bitterness of soul at his hard fate and and each malignant planet that leaves him empty praise and fruitless thanks the only sad return he now can make  ari thanks unavailing thanks  you need not come to add to misery this sharpest pang love in this breast is not a vulgar flame the mere compliance of a will resigned it is generous ecstacy it is boundless ardour a heart that feels like mine will not be paid with cold acknowledgments and fruitless thanks mere gratitude is perfidy in love   perit your bright persections were his favorite theme he sees your days that shone serenely bright discolored now with sorrows not your own he sees you following with unwearied steps one on whom fortune has not yet exhausted her stores of mailce  whom the gods abandon    ari whom justice truth and honor all abandon  perit it grieves him ariadne much it grieves him to see thee overwhelmed in his misfortunes condemned with him to drain the bitter cup of endless woe and since propitious fortune with better omens courts you here at naxos it is now his wish that you renounce for ever a man accursed sad outcast from his country the fatal cause of all your sorrow past   ari the fatal cause of all my woes to come   perit i do not mean to justify his guilt might i advise you you may still be happy a monarch lays his scepter at your feet your father minos will approve your choice all naxos will consent a willing people with fond acclaim will hail you as their queen and theseus never can betray you
