an ode the naked grove now shivers at the blast while his green mantle on the ground is cast bleak are the prospects of the widowed trees mourning their faded glories in the breeze hark where the barns conceal their yellow stores echo repeats the labor of the floors like a young thresher on the neighboring hill her mimic strokes the distant woodlands fill now in the scorpion phoebus rules the day and summers painted foliage fades away shorn is the verdure of the hazelshade while the gale brushes over the auburn glade now ye autumnal beauties mourn the time misspent in prudery while you passed your prime and ere the the plum is of its blue bereft be frugal of the golden hour that is left yon stately pine late triumphed in its shade but mark in autumn how its honors fade the skies prophetic of stern winter wear a sadder robe  and nipping is the air now to the thirsty root the sap descends though still the bough with golden fruitage bends still the hale jasmine boasts its white and green and annuals triumph over the withering scene now teem the cydervats with applewine and emulate the nectar of the vine while ripe pomona labors to produce a cooling beverage for the summers use the fervor of the heated swain to cool while the proud dog star holds his tyrantrule will myra from her plighted promise range shall loves affections with the weather change no though around dismantled forests pine and the gay fields their velvet gloss resign reverse of autumn she shall never fade but ardent truth embower us with its shade the fall of the leaf we all do fade as a leaf isaiah see the leaves around us falling dry and withered to the ground thus to thoughtless mortals calling in a sad and solemn sound  sons of adam once in eden  till like us he blighted fell  hear the lecture we are reading  it is alas the truth we tell  virgins much too much presuming  on your boasted white and red  view us late in beauty blooming  numbered now among the dead  griping misers nightly waking  see the end of all your care  fled on wings of our own making  we have left our owners bare  sons of honor sed on praises  fluttering high in fancied worth  lo the fickle air that raises  brings us down to parent earth  learned sophs in systems jaded  who for new ones daily call  cease at length by us persuaded   every leaf must have its fall  youths though yet no losses grieve you  gay in health and manly grace  let not cloudless skies deceive you  summer gives to autumn place  venerable sires grown hoary  hither turn the unwilling eye  think amidst your falling glory  autumn tells a winter nigh  yearly in our course returning  messengers of shortest stay  thus we preach this truth concerning  heaven and earth shall pass away  on the tree of life eternal  man let all thy hopes be stayed  which alone for ever vernal  bears a leaf that shall not fade the decline of autumn by ww the bosom of earth is all matted with leaves the honors of autumn decay brown ceres no longer exhibits her sheaves to the goldeneyed monarch of day with dissonant guns hills and valleys resound the swains through the coppices rove the partridges bleed on the arable ground the pheasants lie dead in the grove the coats of the hedges look languidly green the swallows relinquish the meads rude winter approaches with horrible mien the flowrets give place to the weeds the sun too is lazy and slumbers abed as loathing so early to rise when risen how dim looks his vapoury head how faint he illumines the skies no more on the poles hang the clustering hops or form a magnificent shade no more on their skirts shine the showery drops for autumn their nurse is decayed the gale that was wont to approach me so kind grows sharp and flies hastily by to give me sweet kisses no longer inclined it bids the tear start from my eye o see while i speak from the guns levelled aim death pierces the birds of the air ye rovers will nothing your conduct reclaim and move your hard bosoms to spare no nothing  ye cry with unanimous voice while ridicule falls from your tongue ye think not ye cruel ones as ye rejoice how once the poor innocents sung to others such barbarous sports i resign and fly to my florimels arms her sanctified love shall be totally mine for virtue adds force to her charms on the base of religion my fair let it rise to crown us with blessings twas given to bid our souls mount from the earth to the skies and give us a foretaste of heaven a farewell to summer an elegy adieu fair spring adorned with chaplets gay ye fields and vernal landscapes all adieu bright summer and the long transparent day no more i hail the scented groves and you farewell the walk where crystal rivulets glide where slender osiers waft the healthful gale where insects float along the silver tide and silent rapture haunts the fruitful vale where purple lawns salubrious odours spread where heathshrubs blossom wild with languid dye where round the hedge unbought perfumes are shed and native beauty courts the roving eye where hawthorns bud and velvet cowslips grow where verdant banks put forth the painted weed whose vivid hues eclipse the embroidered beau and the proud flaunters of the park exceed where solitude unfolds her matchless charms and meek content assumes her happy reign where jocund plenty crowns the rising farms and fills the storehouse of the villageswain how fresh past pleasures dance before the mind renewed in thought by winters coming train that now like vapors on the broadwingd wind haste to deface the beauty of the plain i see with memorys retrospective eye each rivulets polished current smoothly flow see blithsome may hang pearly blossoms high and richly dress the flowery meads below see nodding orchards wave their plumy pride see gardens graced with all the tints of spring enameled beds their tender foliage hide till genial suns a warmer season bring what scenes can equal summers bright display when swift aurora drives her early car when glowing phoebus gives the blushing day and sends his boundless influence wide and far how sweet to see the flocks that crop their food and skip in wanton sport around the field glad to present their bleating gratitude for the green pasture that the meadows yield to hear the wakeful shepherds homely strain breathe welcome sonnets to the rosy beam while slumbering towns in leaden sleep remain and lose substantial pleasures for a dream to tread betimes the neighboring lanes and view ere scorching heat rides on the noontide air the grass the trees the valleys robbed in dew and garden plants the liquid garment wear there often at morn i tuned the rural lay and with my sylvia gently strayed along the birds sat mute on every leafy spray while listening echo caught the flowing song there silent mused on shakespeares tragic page of milton learned to scale the azure road chanted maeonides poetic rage and read o pope thy equal thoughts of god admired great thomsons active skilful muse that in such easy numbers scans the globe such lively colors albions spring renews and paints the beauties of her vernal robe there when the lark began her warbling song and shook her pinions for the morning flight raised the loud chorus of the feathered throng and towerd beyond the farthest reach of sight the tuneful blackbird whistling to his mate far over the lonely forest thrilled the note and cheerful linnets in the woods elate rejoined the melting music of his throat our praise reaped fervor from the general glow the pious airs inspired the heavenly flame the thrushs plaint the cattles meaning low with grateful joy our swelling hearts oercame nor less at eve the rural mansions please or rural virtues charm the exalted soul whose powers not yet enervated by ease like newton grasp creations ample whole in search of learnings gifts unwearied roam the illumined spaces of the milky way traverse the infinitude of natures dome the earth its snowtopd mountains and the sea in every part discover wisdoms hand find deity inscribed on all around omnipotence and love from strand to strand far as the encircling oceans utmost bound for such o spring thy fragrant breezes blow thy newborn flowers expand the crimson leaf thy rays o summer golden prospects show and tinge the grain of ceres pointed sheaf for such mild autumn rears the shooting vines bids juicy clusters swarm the shaded wall enriching crops oerhang her wheaten mines and ripened fruits from bending branches fall to such even winters jarring winds convey the gladsome tidings of eternal peace and storms and clouds that others bliss allay their hope their strength their fortitude increase a farewell to the country written the middle of october adieu the pleasing rural scene thick shades and meadows fair and green the field adorned with sheaves of corn the walk at early hour of morn behold with green no meads are clad behold the thrush sits mute and sad no lively songsters warbling throat pours joy pours music in his note how bare how naked seems yon bed the pink is gone the tulip dead where is the gay the odorous flower that lately blushed in yonder bower so fade the glories of the year they blossom fair and disappear and melancholy truth fond man thy lifes a flower thy days a span almighty sovereign bounteous power whom every clime and tongue adore whose wisdom this vast system planned and formed the sea and formed the land prostrate before thy throne we bow parent of circling seasons thou hasten far happier days  and bring  one glorious and eternal spring on seeing a rose in october thrice happy flower what heavenly aid supports thy strength while others fade what quickening spirit makes thee blow while all thy sisters droop below sure there is a spark of heavenly flame that shoots its warmth throughout thy frame some inborn essence most refined some genial virtue good and kind that makes thy blushing beauties blow and thy mellifluous sweets to flow that gives new life and rears thy head when all thy beauteous race lie dead thou charming rose art now most rare and would be quite beyond compare but that my delia but that she is lovely fair and sweet like thee like thee when other beauties pine she glows with virtue and shall shine deep in the heart the blessing lies the spark divine that never dies which when the frost of age invades when on her cheek thy picture fades shall give new grace new life new air and make her eminently fair on the death of dr parne fellow of trin col came at length poor suffering wretch thy pangs are over death seals thy eyes and thou shall groan no more no more shall misery reach thy tortured breast nor lifes low cares disturb thy settled rest from pride ambition envy malice free thou feelst no more the gripes of penury nor all the thousand pains of sad mortality yet sure some decent honors to thy shade from learnings sons some tribute might be paid in the last office might there not have been some added grace to solemnize the scene the doctor was buried in the college chapel it is usual on the death of any fellow to carry an empty bier with a pall over it round the quadrangle the choir walking before it and all the members of the society behind verses on the deceased are usually fixed to the pall and thrown into the grave  but these ceremonies were omitted  some plaintive muse to deck thy empty bier some pitying friend to drop the tender tear but foes pursued thee to thy latest breath and malice left thee not a friend in death one eye alone i saw with sorrow flow in artless full simplicity of woe the faithful a country boy that waited on the doctor who was observed to cry all the time rustic wept and only he reproached the crowd for lost humanity despised unfelt for unlamented lay in the rude grave the unanimated clay and yet this trampled corse had once a name once was no stranger to the voice of fame this thing despised was once with genius fired nay by the adverse bentley was admired midst grantas sons but lately filled the chair graceful as when her whalleys self was there foe to himself alone his open mind embraced and loved and would have served mankind but niggard fortune acts by partial rules and often her bounty showers on knaves and fools once she could smile on him with glimmering ray but clouded over the evening of his day in lifes decline no healing comfort gave but sunk his soul with sorrow to the grave by hopes too sanguine led he met the fate of all who seek the rich and trust the great he went he bowed he heard and he believed was courted flattered promised  and deceived find we then most to pity or to blame shall we reward with praise or brand with shame if livelier parts to venial faults betray must censure wipe his merits quite away if meagre want with deep affliction joined subdue the reason and unhinge the mind shall we officious every blot reveal and judge him with uncharitable zeal or kindly weep for nature thus decayed and over his failings cast a friendly shade to future ages bid his virtues bloom and bury all his follies in the tomb      fables for grown gentlemen by jhs esquire written in mdcclxi fable i the river with a petition according to the romish creed i speak of rome two thousand years ago the life that they supposed the gods to lead you would not choose to undergo jupiters business day and night was to attend with open ears and eyes and to write down as fast as he could write all the impertinence that men devise besides mens fopperies and ravings the women had so great a share that their absurdities and cravings omnipotence alone could bear and furthermore to try his patience he heard the prayers and fanciful distresses of all his children and relations and of his wife and his mistresses once on a time if you will believe tradition a river in great tribulation to jupiter presented a petition with an expostulating exhortation whereby if the petitioners refused he has a right to think himself illusd a form of prayer contrived for execution exactly like a doublebarrelld gun which if you fire with resolution you have another chance when one is done so far from killing two birds with one stone an art that is very little known all the petitioner desired to do was to kill one with two now this petition showed how the petitioner for his fidelity zeal and devotion had been appointed a commissioner of the revenues of the ocean which he collected with great pains and sent in good and current cash but for his trouble and clear gains the sea returned adulterated trash wherefore he prayed exhorted and submitted that all the sums the ocean paid shall for the future be remitted and issued fair without debasement or impair ungrateful thames the god replied without that mixture and alloy which the sea pours into thee every tide thy beauty and thy strength would wear away without his aid thou would remain like tiber or the poor pretending seine led through parterres or rolled down a cascade confined to vanity and lost to trade it is thus the highlander complains it is thus the union they abuse for binding their backsides in chains and shackling their feet in shoes for giving them both food and fuel and comfortable clothes instead of cruel oatmeal gruel instead of rags and heritable blows luxury every day grows stronger the highland fair beholds her lover now no longer trotting with his buttocks bare thus doctor brown was taken with the spleen and fancied we were all undone raving about a carpet and a screen and out of temper with the sun because it is a crime as he supposes for men to run in winter time into the sun to warm their noses it is an egregious want of sense a want of taste and want of shame to fancy universal affluence and luxury the same in spite of doctor browns discerning the term of universal will agree as well with his benevolence and learning as universal suit with luxury he may perceive if he be so inclined like his discernment luxurys confined for as the gout torments the hands and feet to ease the nobler stomach and the head so luxury to gratify the great insults and robs the labourer of his bread luxury in a state is a disease because it is partial and obstructed wealth but universal affluence and ease is universal happiness and health fable ii the phoenix and her lovers that every females a coquette i could as safely swear upon a book as i could safely bet that every frenchman is a cook a phoenix daughter of the sun chaste as a vestal modest as a nun added such merit to her birth that not a bird though of the highest fashion no feathered coxcomb of the earth ventured to declare his passion they all agreed no earthly bird was worthy of her love none but a bird of the celestial breed an angel from above the phoenix lived so long a maid till all her gaiety and bloom began to fade and savor of the tomb she mopd grew splenetic and tired of so much awe and so much state se longed like other birds to be admired like other birds she longed to find a mate at last she issued out a proclamation to summon the male birds of every nation perhaps this summons and this longing was a political machine just like the lovers that came thronging summoned by our virgin queen now from all quarters the birds appeared in their best clothes nobles in stars and garters curled and embroidered beaux some stately others light and gay one cooed another sung and flattered some like the magpie and the jay for ever chatterd about the inner ring where all the birds of figure press a bat whirled round with leathern wing to show his shape and his address offering his heart his eyes and wings to boot at which there rose an universal hoot the phoenix answered in the tone and in the selfsame manner languishd as queen elizabeth when she was shown a tailor by her beauty vanquished take courage man says she for if i needs must have a tailor i promise without failure to marry none but thee and as the queen coquetted at an age when other queens are tame till she went off the stage the phoenix did the same she died a great coquette and what is more rose from the grave a greater than before the phoenix and selflove are the same beast within the human breast which poets feign the spicy east she builds her solitary nest from whence with every gale of wind the traveller may smell the mind her lovers are our passions these she meets either by appointment or by chance which if she cannot indulge she treats with smiles and complaisance and as the phoenix from her ashes raised returns as blooming as a bride so when we think it dies the lord be praised selflove springs up again with double pride it is a determined case none but ourselves can occupy our place for this same reason physical and clear each individual of us all is that same phoenix without any peer on this terrestrial ball a lover is a madman and a miser not one jot wiser let any try except a lover or one devoted to his pelf whether in all the world they can discover another self fable iii the ducklings and the wise birds a hen one evening to enjoy the cool was walking with a brood of ducklings callow just like a mistress of a boardingschool with misses green and yellow as she was tutoring and schooling this bird fot loitering and that for fooling behold a fish pond so alluring that spite of her remonstrances and cackle they ventured their whole stock without ensuring trusting to their oars and tackle the hen kept scolding like a drab cursing her rebellious race we are not thy children cried a pert young squab if we were chickens we should have more grace on nature we depend our course she steers natures a safer guide and better friend than any dotards fears close by the pond an ancient tower lifted its venerable head a college and sequestered bower where owls for ages had been bred an old professor a great clerk taught them their talents to display to keep their eyes wide open in the dark and shut them in the face of day to think abstractedly to reason deep and to declaim till all the worlds asleep these students from the tower saw our young folks our bold adventurers under sail they heard their clamorous mirth and jokes and heard their nurses fruitless wail observe says one more learned than the rest these birds by instinct know the season to sail to eat to go to rest just as we know by argument and reason we know from reason and experience both we see it every hour that governors are loath to part with power yon hen which you all hear in such a fright undoubtedly affects that fear to keep her pupils always in her sight from the same principle for the same end our tutor keeps us all thus penned preaching that we must not pretend to fly we are too weak it is too soon which i will demonstrate to be a lie as clear as the sun at noon feet said the subtle owl are not the things that constitute the essence of a fowl so much as wings whatever is essential to our make we soonest learn and seldomest mistake hence that pathetic prayer that tender call by which we get our wants dispatched is so essential above all that we all speak the moment we are hatched nature benevolent and wise opens our mouths much sooner than our eyes by parity of reason meet our wings and pinions should be ready long time before our heads and feet are firm and steady therefore twill follow like a chain that as we walk you must confess with little giddiness and pain if we attempt it we must fly with less this reasoning philosophic wight convinced his brethren one and all with one accord they took their flight and fatal and untimely was their fall none of them reasoned any more the young logicians lay like wrecks drowned in the pond or scattered on the shore with mangled limbs and broken necks bred in a court or some gay city the ducklings are those thoughtless spritely fools o cambridge is it not a pity strangers to thee and to thy schools fable iv la noblesse de france the fighting cock and the craven a cock an officer of foot in france retired into a village where he did naught but crow and strut and live by pillage whenever he had a mind to take his pastime with the fair he was not to one wife confined nor to a pair but like a lord had half a dozen both at bed and board he spied a barndoor fowl one day crammed from the rump up to the gullet in amorous dalliance and play with a young pullet his robes and train his senatorial cap his size almost the size of geese showed that he had been nurtured in the lap of peace bred for the bench and presidental chair he judged he roosted and digested there the military cock took as much pleasure as an unlucky page to see the magistrate employ his leisure so much below his dignity and age he that should set a good example be virtuous and discreet to tread on modesty and trample chastity beneath his feet fine times says he when judges run seducing maidens in the open sun this wanton fit comes of intemperance and overeating which as it soon will bring you to the spit shall save your reverence from a beating to this reproof with a sly sneer the judge replied aloof it is true that i and all my brood when we have run the race assigned shall have the honor to become the food and comfort of mankind an unexpected death shall gently steal not force away our breath good colonel you are mightily mistaken it is not owing to respect in deed that you are neither boiled like us with bacon roasted nor fricasseed but though your flesh be mens aversion yet it contributes much to their diversion they give you barley bread and oats because they take great pleasure and delight to see you fight to see you cutting one anothers throats if you escape and are not slain in war you are in a worse plight by far amongst the hogs wounded and lame youre on a dunghill cast by wanton boys and puppy dogs worried or teased to death at last in france the land tax is not as it is here a tax where you appeal and squabble there the nobility go free and clear like the rascality and rabble the same exemption pards and tigers own and the base polecat caught in gins their flesh and bone we let alone and ask them nothing but their skins fable v the dog and the cat interest fascinates both age and youth and with a glance of her bewitching eye can make a minister speak truth or make a mighty monarch tell a lie she can set brothers by the ears and what you will scarce believe perhaps make sisters as harmonious as the spheres and live together without pulling caps it is she gives every one her place often like a blundering marshal at a feast joining a scoundrel to his grace an atheist to a priest interest well understood made solomon makes melcomb now declare that life is only good to eat and drink and laugh and banish care close by a kitchen fire a dog and cat each a famous politician were meditating as they sat plans and projects of ambition by the same fire were set to warm fragments of their masters dinner temptations to alarm the frailty of a sinner clear prurient water streamed from pompeys jaws and tabby looked demure and licked her paws and as two plenipos for fear of a surprise when both have something to propose examine one anothers eyes or like two maids though smit by different swains in jealous conference over a dish of tea pompey and tabby both cudgelled their brains studying each others physiognomy pompey endowed with finer sense discovered in a cast of tabbys face a symptom of concupiscence which made it a clear case when strait applying to the dawning passion pompey addressed her in this fashion both you and i with vigilance and zeal becoming faithful dogs and pious cats have guarded day and night this commonweal from robbery and rats all that we get for this heaven knows is a few bones and many blows let us no longer fawn and whine since we have talents and are able let us impose an equitable fine upon our masters table and to be brief let us each choose a single dish i will be contented with roast beef take you that turbot  you love fish thus every dog and cat agrees when they can settle their own fees thus two contending chiefs are seen to agree at last in every measure one takes the management of the marine the other of the nations treasure thus l  g retired thus even p  t his popularity resigned for a tidbit a pittance suited to the patriots mind fable vi the spider and the fly with malice fell a spider watched within his cell ready to sally the unwary traveller to souse like a jewbroker in the alley or a dutch merchant in his counting house like them he corresponded far and near and though his trade was intricate and dark he managed his affairs and kept all clear without a partner or a clerk a petit maitre an active bustling fly thinking to scamper unmolested with airy equipage as he passed by by cruel cacus was arrested furnished with that undaunted sense which only courts and camps can teach having no weapon or defense except his instrument of speech the fly with flattering soporific strains tried to benumb the spiders brains hearing such daily praise bestowed upon your elegance in weaving i came to visit your abode which is magnificent beyond believing and now i am convinced if you will drop the linen trade and take to weaving velvets and brocade the salladeaters soon must shut up shop change but your diet and like theirs your taste will grow refined correct and chaste as i have studied every herb and leaf that is either noxious or good to eat make me your caterer in chief and pourveyor of all your meat send me this instant in a trice i will bring you something savoury and nice seeing the spider smile and grin he found his plot would not succeed it was too thin for one of that sagacious breed on which he fell a vapouring and buzzing swearing the drones would take the alarm and come to the assistance of their cousin with an enormous swarm the drones and i are no such strangers we know said cacus what we both can do they are too wise to run their heads in dangers for such a busy meddling fool as you but since you come to spoil our manufacture and poison honest traders i will hang you like a malefactor to terrify invaders no sooner said than done he knocked him down and hung him in the sun the spiders a negotiator and an ensnaring captious debater obdurate subtle and alert the fly a coxcomb and a prater teazing and pert though all such characters i hate and from my soul despise may we have many spiders in the state when we are plagued with french and spanish flies fable vii the wild ducks and the water spaniel after a tedious flight of many a stormy day and night a flock of wild ducks sailing up and down upon a lake were making merry like sailors in a seaport town just arrived from pondicherry a swan too stately for sport to show herself was all her view had undertaken to escort the jovial crew swelling and bridling with all the airs of a fine dame at court turning about and sidling advancing and then stopping short displaying in her features contempt and insolent dejection to signify that those strange creatures were forced upon her for protection i must confess amongst mankind i have seen swans as foolishly inclined at paris on the seine i have seen a french marquee conduct a pair of german barons to the fair of saint german strutting before them tossing up his head then looking back and lowering his crest the barons were so awkward so illbred and so illdressd have you not seen a newmade peer with equal pride but greater trepidations observing in his rear a troop of country relations run up saint jamessstreet and at two leaps take arthurs steps those steps as terrible as the tarpeian from whence with one black ball youre hurled into another world amongst the damned plebeian perhaps this grave and solemn swan disliked the company of those wildducks just as a prude or sober man dislikes the company of bucks for while they made more noise and riot than twenty justices of peace the swan was serious and quiet as captain gander marching with his geese marching to the field with gorget and a wooden shield about the middle of the lake upon the banks a waterspaniel lay looking out for duck or drake or any lawful prey and as the captain of a privateer lies by nor offers to bear down nor gives a cheer till his expected prize begins to fly close to the shore the spaniel let them sail and rushed into the lake when they turned tail snorting and snoring pursuing them with all his force swearing and roaring till he was hoarse he turned and veerd now made a stretch and then a tack now snappd and now they disappeared and rose again a long way back till the poor spiritless exhausted brute was forced to give up the pursuit and as the french to toulon ran and left the spaniards in a scrape the moment that the fray began the swan made her escape quite out of reach a roan duck on the beach under a shed considered the whole scene with wonder just like caligula under the bed studying the cause of lightning and thunder as the victorious crew passed by in order he made them an oration the roan duck being the recorder or burgomaster of the corporation leave your abandoned lives roving like pirates and jews come hither with your children and wives and settle peaceably in our mews well take you without any fuss here we have neither law nor code youre only tied to copy us and go by custom and the mode you shall be fashionably dressed protected treated and caressed a friseur with an instrument of steel shall shape your wings and your toupee make them sit perfectly genteel easy and free as to the rest you may gather from my looks whether the air is good and whether we have wholesome food or tolerable cooks peace wretch the chieftain of the ducks replied nor with thy venal breath offend the brave freedom is as much our pride as it is thine to be a slave we neither injure nor provoke we neither fear great nor small because we scorn to yield to any yoke we are hated by them all from pole to pole pursued from pole to pole our enemies have every soul been baffled and subdued lords of three elements we can maintain our freedom and possessions with the same ease that we disdain thy offers and insidious professions in our own virtue we confide on others how can we rely when fear or hope envy or pride may turn a friend into a false ally those who depend on others whether on males or females they depend will find the swan has many brothers and sisters without end the advice of an old spaniel a certain dog of middling birth frolicksome and full of play even in the height of all his mirth delicate as well as gay with far more feeling for his friend than they could either taste or comprehend  being thrown into the world betimes betimes discovered it was all a cheat yet not so dangerous for odious crimes as odious for malice and deceit often when he meant to have amused his friends with a conceit or harmless jest by many he was snarld at and abused and slighted even by the best often when halfstarvd he found a bone or something hid instead of eating it alone as others did he ran to share his daily bread unsought with those that were much better fed than taught his daily bread they seized and drove him from their mess more disappointed and displeased with their ingratitude than his distress it is a maxim amongst dogs when they have the address and skill to slip their collars and their clogs and leave their friends that use them ill to avoid anxiety and strife tray was resolved to try a country life a country dog i think is exactly like a country squire they both are only fit to sleep and stink by their own fire and when awake are only good to yelp and halloo in a wood their joys and conversation are the same it is all a clamor and a noise and all the noise and clamor about game three words compose their whole vocabulary a fox a hare and a fine scenting day whether they are serious or merry it is all they have to say in short they never are so entertaining as when they are fast asleep or feigning to quit such friends as these one would not grieve tray parted from them with great ease without so much as taking leave consults his grandsire by profession a spaniel for judgment and discretion a perfect daniel benign and mild he heard his grandsons grievances and smiled grandson said he i do conceive if you had known the world and how things go but half as much as you believe which is twice as much as i believe you know you would not have complained that dogs behave to one another when they are unchaind like every creature to his brother say dupe of a rash confidence and trust if you lie open and unguarded is it not just that vigilance should be rewarded twas neither natures call nor my instruction to trust your friends at all much less to trust them to your own destruction a painful and severe attention is but a necessary fence to every dog of sense against deceit and circumvention a task from which you hoped to be relieved by trusting to your friends you are deceived acting as much as they for your own ends all the world knows that friendships a mere sound a sound that hardly can impose upon a puppy hound nature is not to blame flattered by cunning indolence invented that foolish name by which so many fools are circumvented happiness you will seldom find unless you learn to have no weighty interest or concern with those of your own kind unless you learn if it is not too late that they are neither worth your love nor hate a present to a young lady with a pair of stockings by  fellow of  cambridge to please the fair what different ways each lover acts his part one tenders snuff another praise a toothpick or a heart alike they all to gain their end peculiar arts disclose while i submissive only send an humble pair of hose long may they guard from cold and harm the snowy limbs that wear em and kindly lend their influence warm to every thing that is near em but let it not be faulty deemed nor move your indignation if i a little partial seemed in gifts or commendation each fair perfection to display would far exceed my charter my humble muse must never stray above the knee or garter and who did ever a subject view so worthy to be praised or from so fair foundation knew so fine a structure raised thou learned leach sage kember say in spite of drugs and plasters you who can talk the livelong day of buildings and pilasters you who for hours have roved about through halls and colonades and scarce would deign to tread on aught but arches and arcades did you in all your mazy rounds two nobler pillars view what yielding marble ere was found so exquisitely true the swelling dome with stately show may many fancies please

which nature has denied  but far from her i seek these lonely bowers  and sooth with rural tasks the tedious hours  pluck the pale primrose from its velvet bed  or stray where cowslips hang the dewy head  and pensive listen to the rustic lay  of jocund mowers chanting over their hay  now wrapped in thought and lost in devious shades  with tuneful bards i court the inspiring maids  with thomson

glowing charms that deck her polished face  and must these glowing charms i sighing cry  still be revealed alone to fancys eye  now pleased i listen to the feathered throng  while love inspires and nature tunes the song  the lark sweet leader of the glossy train  tells his shrill tale of love nor tells in vain  hoarse through the wood the turtle strains her throat  and cooes responsive to the ringdoves note  while the blithe linnet in yon hawthornspray  delighted twitters her ecstatic lay  to this soft theme each rising morn attends  and evening hears it when her dew descends  and can

whose flame these objects guide  nor envy addison his titled bride  and undelighted all this landscape see  while every thought eugenia turns on thee  and no kind vista points the fair retreat  where

complain  the soothing breezes to your sighs reply  and pitying drops soft trickle from the sky  then fly fond shepherd from this gloomy grove  and seek the covert of yon close alcove  there from all storms a shelter you may find  but love that raging tempest of the mind farewell to hope an ode by the same hope sweetest child of fancy born though transient as the dew of morn thou who can charm with sound and light the deafend ear and darkened sight and in dry deserts glad the swains with bubbling springs and cultured plains no more invent thy airy schemes nor mock me with fantastic dreams no more thy flattering stories tell deceitful prattler hope farewell adieu the pleasing prospect planned by fancys fair delusive hand no more that momentary ray which gilds by fits a showery day shall show me in a distant grove health friendship peace content and love while many a nymph and many a youth by hymen joined and crowned by truth on verdant hillocks danced and played or warbled in the hawthorn shade no more with sweet endearing talk shall thou beguile my vernal walk no more as through the wintry vale we journey on with many a tale of fancied pleasure cheer the day and strew with flowers the rugged way still pointing to that rural cell where innocence and stella dwell charm with the bubbling of a rill that gushes from the neighboring hill o let me now in silence rove through yon sequestered cypress grove where crowned with leaves of baleful yew and circled by a stygian crew when from the ivymantled tower the cock proclaims the midnight hour pale melancholy takes her round

scene to hear it is just like punch and his interpreter on trifles some are earnestly absurd you will think the world depends on every word  what is not every mortal free to speak  i will give my reasons though i break my neck and what is the question if it shines or rains whether it is twelve or fifteen miles to stains the wretch reduced to rags by every vice pride projects races mistresses and dice the rich rogue shuns though full as bad as he and knows a quarrel is good husbandry  it is strange cries peter you are out of pelf  i am sure i thought you wiser than myself yet gives him nothing  but advice too late  retrench or rather mortgage your estate  i can advance the sum  it is best for both   but henceforth cut your coat to match your cloth a minister in mere revenge and sport will give his foe a paltry place at court the dupe for every royal birthday buys new horses coaches clothes and liveries plies at the levee and distinguished there lives on the royal whisper for a year his mistress shines in brussels and brocade and now the wretch ridiculously mad draws on his banker mortgages and fails then to the country runs away from jails there ruined by the court he sells a vote to the next burgess as of old he bought rubs down the steeds which once his chariot bore or sweeps the borough which he served before but by this roving meteor led i tend beyond my theme forgetful of my friend then take advice and preach not out of time when good lord middlesex is bent on rhyme their humor checked or inclination crossed sometimes the friendship of the great is lost with innocent amusements still comply hunt when he hunts and lay the fathers by for your reward you gain his love and dine on the best venison and the best french wine never in wine or wrath betray your trust be silent still and obstinately just explore no secrets draw no characters for echo will repeat and walls have ears nor let a busy fool a secret know a secret gripes him till he lets it go words are like bullets and we wish in vain when once discharged to call them back again defend dear spence the honest and the civil but to cry up a rascal  that is the devil who guards a good mans character it is known at the same time protects and guards his own for as with houses so it fares with names a shed may set a palace all on flames the fire neglected on the cottage preys and mounts at last into a general blaze it is a fine thing some think a lord to know i wish his tradesmen could but think so too he gives his word  then all your hopes are gone he gives his honor  then youre quite undone most folks so partial to themselves are grown they hate a temper differing from their own the grave abhor the gay the gay the sad and formalists pronounce the witty mad the sot who drinks six bottles in a place swears at the flinchers who refuse their glass would you not pass for an illnatured man comply with every humor that you can pope will instruct you how to pass away your time like him and never lose a day from hopes or fears your quiet to defend to all mankind as to yourself a friend and sacred from the world retired unknown to lead a life with morals like his own when to delicious pimpern i retire what greater bliss my spence can i desire contented there my easy hours i spend with maps globes books my bottle and a friend there i can live upon my income still even though the house should pass the quakers bill yet to my share should some good prebend fall i think myself of size to fill a stall for life or health let heaven my lot assign a firm and even soul shall still be mine hor epist xix book i imitated by the same hand to mr lowth it is said dear sir no poets please the town who drink mere water though from helicon for in cold blood they seldom boldly think their rhymes are more insipid than their drink not great apollo could the train inspire till generous bacchus helped to fan the fire warmed by two gods at once they drink and write rhyme all the day and tipple all the night homer says horace nods in many a place but hints he nodded oftener over the glass inspired with wine old ennius sung and thought with the same spirit that his heroes fought and we from johnsons tavernlaws divine that bard was no great enemy to wine twas from the bottle king derived his wit drank till he could not talk and then he writ let no coifd sergeant touch the sacred juice but leave it to the bards for better use let the grave judges too the glass forbear who never sing and dance but once a year this truth once known the poets take the hint get drunk or mad and then get into print to raise their flames indulge the mellow fit and lose their senses in the search of wit and when with claret fired they take the pen swear they can write because they drink like ben such mimic swift or prior to their cost for in the rash attempt the fools are lost when once a genius breaks through common rules he leads a herd of imitating fools if pope the prince of poets fick abed over steaming coffee bends his aching head the fools in public over the fragrant draught incline those heads that never achd or thought this must provoke his mirth or his disdain cure his complaint  or make him sick again i too like them the poets path pursue and keep great flaccus ever in my view but in a distant view  yet what i write in these loose sheets must never see the light epistles odes and twenty trifles more things that are born and die in half an hour  what you must dedicate says sneering spence  this year some new performance to the prince  though money is your scorn no doubt in time  you hope to gain some vacant stall by rhyme  like other poets were the truth but known  you too admire whatever is your own these wise remarks my modesty confound while the laugh rises and the mirth goes round vexed at the jest yet glad to shun a fray i whisk into a coach and drive away an epistle to mr spence in imitation of horace epist x book i by the same health from the bard who loves the rural sport to the more noble bard that haunts the court in every other point of life we chime like two soft lines when coupled into rhyme i praise a spacious villa to the sky you a close garret full five stories high i revel here in natures varied sweets you in the nobler scents of london streets i left the court and here at ease reclined am happier than the king who stayed behind twelve stifling dishes i could scarce live over at home i dine with luxury on four where would a man of judgment choose a seat but in a wholesome rural soft retreat where hills adorn the mansion they defend where could he better answer natures end here from the sea the melting breezes rise unbind the snow and warm the wintry skies here gentle gales the dogstars heat allay and softly breathing cool the sultry day how free from cares from dangers and affright in pleasing dreams i pass the silent night does not the variegated marble yield to the gay colors of the flowery field can the newrivers artificial streams or the thick waters of the troubled thames in many a winding rusty pipe conveyed or dashed and broken down a deep cascade with our clear silver streams in sweetness vie that in eternal rills run bubbling by in dimples over the polished pebbles pass glide over the sands or glitter through the grass and yet in town the country prospects please where stately colonnades are flanked with trees on a whole country looks the master down with pride where scarce five acres are his own yet nature though repelled maintains her part and in her turn she triumphs over art the handmaid now may prejudice our taste but the fair mistress will prevail at last that man must smart at length whose puzzled sight mistakes in life false colors for the right as the poor dupe is sure his loss to rue who takes a pinchbeck guinea for a true the wretch whose frantic pride kind fortune crowns grows twice as abject when the goddess frowns as he who rises when his head turns round must tumble twice as heavy to the ground then love not grandeur it is a splendid curse the more the love the harder the divorce we live far happier by these gurgling springs than statesmen courtiers counselors or kings the stag expelled the courser from the plain  what can he do  he begs the aid of man he takes the bit and proudly bears away his new ally  he fights and wins the day but ruined by success he strives in vain to quit his master and the curb again so from the fear of want most wretches fly but lose their noblest wealth their liberty to their imperious passions they submit who mount ride spur but never draw the bit it is with your fortune spence as with your shoe a large may wrench a small one wring your toe then bear your fortune in the golden mean  not every man is born to be a dean i will bear your jeers if ever i am known to seek two cures when scarce i merit one riches it is true some service may afford but oftener play the tyrant over their lord money i scorn but keep a little still to pay my doctors or my lawyers bill from encombes soft romantic scenes i write deep sunk in ease in pleasure and delight yet though her generous lord himself is here twould be one pleasure more could you appear the invitation an epistle to a friend at court by the same if you can leave for books the crowded court and generous bourdeaux for a glass of port to these sweet solitudes without delay break from the worlds impertinence away soon as the sun the face of nature gilds for health and pleasure will we range the fields over her gay scenes and opening beauties run while all the vast creation is our own but when his golden globe with faded light yields to the solemn empire of the night and in her sober majesty the moon with milder glories mounts her silver throne amidst ten thousand orbs with splendour crowned that pour their tributary beams around through the long levelled tube our strengthened sight shall mark distinct the spangles of the night from world to world shall dart the boundless eye and stretch from star to star from sky to sky the buzzing insect families appear when suns unbind the rigor of the year quick glance the myriads round the evening bower hosts of a day or nations of an hour astonished we shall see the unfolding race stretched out in bulk within the polished glass through whose small unequal a new world we spy never seen before but by a seraphs eye so long in darkness shut from human kind lay half gods wonders to a point confined but in one peopled drop we now survey in pride of power some little monster play over tribes invisible he reigns alone and struts a tyrant of a world his own now will we study homers awful page now warm our souls with pindars noble rage to english lays shall flaccus lyre be strung and lofty virgil speak the british tongue immortal virgil at thy sacred name i tremble now and now i pant for fame with eager hopes this moment i aspire to catch or emulate thy glorious fire the next pursue the rash attempt no more but drop the quill bow wonder and adore by thy strong genius overcome and awed that fire from heaven that spirit of a god pleased and transported with thy name i tend beyond my theme forgetful of my friend and from my first design by rapture led neglect the living poet for the dead ode to john pit esquire advising him to build a banqueting house on a hill that overlooks the sea from this tall promontorys brow you look majestic down and see extended wide below the horizon all your own with growing piles the vales are crowned here hills peep over hills there the vast sky and sea profound the increasing prospect fills o bid my friend a structure rise and this huge round command then shall this little point comprise the ocean and the land then you like aeolus on high from your aerial tower shall see secure the billows fly and hear the whirlwinds roar you with a smile their rage despise till some sad wreck appears and calls from your relenting eyes the sympathizing tears thus may you view with proud delight while winds the deep deform till human woes your grief excite all nature in a storm majestic awful scene when hurled on surges surges rife and all the heaving watery world tumultuous mounts the skies the seas and thunder roar by turns by turns the peals expire the billows flash and either burns with momentary fire but lo the furious tempests cease the mighty rage subsides old ocean hushed in solemn peace has stilled the murmuring tides spread wide abroad the glassy plain in various colors gay reflects the glorious sun again and doubly gilds the day the horizon glows from side to side and flames with glancing rays the floating trembling silver tide is one continual blaze your eyes the prospect now command all uncontrolled and free fly like a thought from land to land and dart from sea to sea thus while above the clouds we sit and innocently gay pass in amusements wine or wit the sultry hours away sometimes with pity or disdain in thought a glance we throw down on the poor the proud the vain in yonder world below we see from this exalted seat how shrunk reduced confined the little person of the great as little as his mind see there  amidst the crowds our view some scattered virtues strike but those so thronged and these so few the world looks all alike yet through this cloud of human kind the talbots we survey the pitts the yorks the seckers find who shine in open day to the same on the same subject over curious models as you rove the vales with piles to crown and great palladios plans improve with nobler of your own o bid a structure over the floods from this high mountain rise where we may sit enthroned like gods and revel in the skies the ascending breeze at each repast shall breathe an air divine give a new brightness to the taste new spirit to the wine or these low pleasures we may quit for banquets more refined the works of each immortal wit the luxury of the mind plato or boyles or newtons page our towering thoughts shall raise or homers fire or pindars rage or virgils lofty lays or with amusive thoughts the sea shall entertain the mind while we the rolling scene survey an emblem of mankind where like sworn foes successive all the furious surges run to urge their predecessors fall though followed by their own where like our moderns so profound engaged in dark dispute the skuttles cast their ink around to puzzle the dispute where sharks like shrewd directors thrive like lawyers rob at will where flyingfish like trimmers live like soldiers swordfish kill where on the less the greater feed the tyrants of an hour till the huge royal whales succeed and all at once devour thus in the moral world we now too truly understand each monster of the sea below is matched

come in what unguarded hour did i impart to these fair virgins all my darling art in all my wit i saw these rivals shine but this one art i thought was always mine yet lo i yield their mistress now no more but proud to learn from these i taught before for look what vegetable sense is here how warm with life these blushing leaves appear what tempered splendors over the piece are laid shade steals on light and light dies into shade through heavens gay bow less various beauties run and far less bright though painted by the sun see in each blooming flower what spirit glows what vivid colors flush

while these bright nymphs the needle guide to paint the rose in all her pride nature like her may blush to own herself so far by art outdone these flowers she raised with all her care so blooming so

before the household deities we eat the slaves themselves regale on choicest meat free from mad laws we sit reclined at ease and drink as much or little as we please some quaff large bumpers that expand the soul and some grow mellow with a moderate bowl we never talk of this mans house or vill or whether lepos dances well or ill but of those duties which ourselves we owe and which it is quite a scandal not to know as whether wealth or virtue can impart the truest pleasure to the human heart what should direct us in our choice of friends their own pure merit or our private ends what we may deem if rightly understood mans sovereign bliss his chief his only good meantime my friend old cervius never fails to cheer our converse with his pithy tales praise but arellius or his illgot store his fable thus begins in days of yore a country mouse within his homely cave a treat to one of note a courtier gave a good plain mouse our host who loved to spare those heaps of forage he had gleaned with care yet on occasion would his soul unbend and feast with hospitality his friend he brought wild oats and vetches from his hoard dried grapes and scraps of bacon graced the board in hopes no doubt by such a various treat to tempt the dainty traveller to eat squat on fresh chaff the master of the feast left all the choicest viands for his guest nor one nice morsel for himself would spare but gnawed coarse grain or nibbled at a tare at length their slender dinner finished quite thus to the rustic spoke the mouse polite  how can my friend a wretched being drag  on the bleak summit of

must die that draw this vital breath  nor great nor small can shun the shafts of death  it is ours to sport in pleasures while we may  for ever mindful of lifes little day these weighty reasons swayed the country mouse and light of heart he sallied from his house resolved to travel with this courtly spark and gain the city when securely dark now midnight hovered over this earthly ball when our small gentry reached a stately hall where brightly glowing stained with tyrian dye on ivory couches richest carpets lie and in large baskets ranged along the floor the rich collation of the night before on purple bed the courtier placed his guest and with choice cates prolonged the grateful feast he carved he served as much as mouse could do and was his waiter and his taster too joy seized the rustic as at ease he lay this happy change had made him wondrous gay  when lo the doors burst open in a trice and at their banquet terrified the mice they start they tremble in a deadly fright and round the room precipitate their flight the highroofd room with hideous cries resounds of baying mastiffs and loudbellowing hounds then thus the rustic in the courtiers ear  adieu kind sir i thank you for your cheer  safe in my cell your state i envy not  tares be my food and liberty my lot f  a parody on the city and country mouse a country vicar in his homely house pleased with his lot and happy in his spouse with simple diet at his humble board once entertained the chaplain of a lord  he gave him all he could a little fish with sauce of oysters in no silver dish and for the craving stomachs sure relief the glory of old england rare roastbeef horseradish and potatoes irelands pride a pudding too the prudent dame supplied their cheering beverage was a pint of port though small the quantum of the better sort but plenty of good beer both small and stout with wine of elder to prevent the gout the vicar hoped by such a various treat to tempt his scarfembellishd friend to eat with nicest bits provoked his guest to dine he carved the haddock and he served the wine content his own sharp stomach to regale with plain substantial roastmeat and mild ale our courtly chaplain as we may suppose at such oldfashioned commons curled his nose he tried in vain to piddle and in brief pishd at the pudding and declined the beef  at length their homely dinner finished quite thus to the vicar spoke the priest polite  how can my brother in this paltry town  live undistinguished to the world unknown  and not exalt your towering genius higher  than here to herd with country clown  or squire  stunned with the discord of hoarse cawing rooks  the roar of winds the dissonance of brooks  which discontented through the valley stray  plaintive and murmuring at their long delay  come come with me nor longer here abide  you have friends in town and i will be your guide  soon great preferment to your share will fall  a good fat living or perhaps  a stall these weighty reasons swayed the vicars mind  to town he hied but left his wife behind  next leveeday he waited on his grace with hundreds more who bowed to get a place should in the crowd he stood amazed to see lords who to baal bent the supple knee and doctors sage he could not but admire who stooped profoundly low  to rise the higher so much of ermine lace beaus bishops young and old twas like a cloud of sable edged with gold by turns his grace the servile train addressed pleased with a smile or in a whisper blessed sick of the scene the vicar sought the door determined never to see london more but as his friend had pleased the hour to fix first went to dinner to my lords at six  he knocked  was ushered to the room of state my lord abroad and dinner served in plate which though it seemed but common soup and hash was really callipee and callipash the relics of the gaudy day before what indians eat and englishmen adore with bright champaign the courtier crowned the feast soothed his own pride and gratified his guest all this conspired our stoic to control and warpt the steady purpose of his soul  when lo the cry of fire creates amaze   the next house lady riots in a blaze  aghast the vicar stood in wild
