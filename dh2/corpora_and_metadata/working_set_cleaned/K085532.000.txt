epistles philosophical and moral   london printed for t wilcox opposite the newchurch in the strand mdcclix  to the first minister of state for the time being hail mighty pam if song without offense thus hail the first court card in eminence thou in whom kings find often the sovereign sway for kings at loo the leading knave obey or if content to play an humbler game plain jack we style thee more familiar name thou whose sly blows the lower party feels while bent the high to catch thy tripping heels great in thyself whatever thou art called nations by thee enfranchised or inthralld hollad to day to palaceyard along flattered at once in metzotint and song or piqud perhaps while chimes the present line ere yet turned out as usual to resign branded by the honest satire of the times with all a ministers mysterious crimes to thee i pay my court till in disgrace and then as humbly to the next in place for know what private worth soever thy boast i not address thy person but thy post is there a time when statesmen good or great look down with pity on the toils of state superior to the boast of boasted things the pomp of titles and the smile of kings when in the private hour of social ease ambition sleeps and truth itself may please at such an hour when even politeness deigns to taste the rudeness of familiar strains presuming thou in honor to the muse indulgent once her labors may peruse to thee those honest labors she commends at court while honest doubtless finding friends but through thy levee if forbid to press in freedoms plain and anticourtiers dress light of her rhimes as of petitions made should they be lost forgotten or mislaid if not so vain to think thou should commend in either case permit me to defend too well i know imputed as a crime the gift of reason to the man of rhyme to childish fiction gingling numbers tied as bells that dangle by its infant side to useless whims poetic worth confined to strike the sense but not improve the mind should on the daring verse then censure fall from priest or prelate wakened in the stall or should the learned jurors take in hand to burn the books they may not understand scorned the loud torrent of the mobs abuse with thee i leave my error and excuse know then my patron once upon a time while yet a boy i caught the itch of rhyme but born with hatred to the singsong train whose numbers charm like empty notes in vain while strange to themes to employ the muse about the peccant humor broke but little out till late in waking dreams that trouble youth on one side prudence urged on the other truth prudence a worldlyminded dame and sly who fixed on earth still kept her cautious eye while truth whose open breast did mine inflame looked up to heaven to heaven from whence she came when now my eager heart her power confessed and thus her willing captive truth addressed art thou my friend that enterprizing youth who make pretensions to the song of truth by reason taught to leave in early life the wanton mistress for the faithful wife among the sciences thy subject choose philosophys the sister of the muse prudence who heard made various hems and haws and after due deliberating pause shaking her head beware rash youth she cried let prudence here your early footsteps guide art thou so ignorant as not to know truth leads us often to poverty and woe let me advise  would thou succeed in rhyme mark at the proper season well thy time taking this maxim as a general rule the knave is honest till he plays the fool for times there are of such malignant face that sharpers only rise to power and place times when the mere huzza for public good breaks down all ranks of honor and of blood when sacred characters like bawds are used and princes with impunity abused the throne of majesty a vulgar thing while george the cobbler damns great george the king in times like these behold on every side what pains we take offensive truth to hide ashamed to show her bashful face at court see her simplicity the mobs rude sport her lovers stigmatized by general hate as bold disturbers of the church and state would thou to this abandoned tribe belong what bard ever heeded yet the truth of song again it is certain there may come a time when impudence finds no excuse in rhyme when even prudence may herself be just her interest more to keep than break her trust when crowns are honored and in proper season  shbbre dread patriot may be hanged for treason a time perhaps years work the strangest things when the brave scots may love their best of kings when slighted science may approach the throne and britons make true policy their own what though their patriot hearts are known to fail when dearth of barley threatens want of ale what though religion armed by commonsense breaks but its weapons in its own defense even yet may piety be kept alive and half expiring patriotism revive at such a season should the muse inspire if touched with caution may thou strike the lyre perhaps uncensurd but to look for praise know these young bard are no poetic days but should the age as probably it may turn its loose politics another way while in religious mood far pushed the schemes of true born britons always in extremes the times may yet return when frantic zeal shall give its wooden sword an edge of steel when convocations shall in judgment sit to canvass the infidelity of wit on wicked knowledge britains guilt to lay and drive the destined victim far away o thus if ignorance should rule in turn bards lose their ears and martyr theists burn ready reforming constables at hand of scientifick vice to cleanse the land have thou with truth nor morals aught to do things are not always fit that may be true here prudence ended  her advice was good but truth had charms that could not be with stood hers then the muse  how far success will show in times like ours her song be a propos so much indeed of prudence did i learn my fingers never in politics to burn silent i sat amidst the party rout when late the ministry turned in and out when raged the furious goosequills of the times to shame their country with their shameless rhimes careless what turtleeating son of whites might set the blunders of the state to rights if pollio gallus tully or his grace should all keep out or who get into place i cared not i though these or none of these the king the house or mightier mob might please blamed i the peer whom adverse winds had blown round the wide world to prop a monarchs throne taught in the hurricanes of southern seas the statesmans wisdom and the courtiers ease by plundered spaniards the consummate skill to steer a kingdom like a bark at will though made too plain the leeway of the realm did i presume to bid him mind the helm nay when the guardian genii of the land to save our desperate fortunes took in hand i sung them not though crowned by half the nation with civick wreaths from town and corporation i never officious cracked my brains tamend errors the great alone might comprehend plagued with no songs of praise our lord the king nor gave one faggot to the blaze of byng but free from panegyric as abuse put all my little wit to private use thus far of tempral politics i am clear nor has the spiritual had more to fear since gospel witnesses in form were tried their valid evidence i never denied never intermeddled with the jurys quest nor contradicted littleton or west when church and state learned warburton would join though sad thaffair i made it none of mine nor did i ever against lelands pen presume to vindicate lord bolingbroke or hume made no pretense to freedom of debate nor riskd like harmless  n  t woolstons fate and though for once in this a trick of youth prudential views are sacrificed to truth could i shake off those vices rhyme and sense this first might likely prove my last offense or in thy cause enlisted once my pen i never more might trouble truth again but to thy purpose turn my ready hand true to the law and gospel of the land   advertisement the ground work of the following epistles being the fruit of a private correspondence it was found necessary in preparing them for the press to adapt them to more general use and amusement it may not therefore be improper to observe that whatever theological subjects have fallen in the authors way he has purposely avoided taking part with divines of any sect or party leaving it to the ingenuous of every persuasion to determine how far their particular sentiments may be supported by authorities superior to commonsense and simple demonstration  as to his poetry having no reputation to lose he is little anxious about what he may acquire indeed it must be confessed that perspicuity and argument have been frequently consulted at the expense both of the dignity and harmony of his numbers elegance however would have been more attended to had the authors leisure permitted or had his design been to distinguish himself as a poet a character he is much less ambitious of than that of a philosopher  unmoved by sophistry unawed by name no dupe to doctrines and no fool to fame     contents epistle the first  page       of truth in general its criterion its relation to opinion the uncertainty of the latter necessary that both should concur in science epistle the second  page        on science as our guide to truth the criterion best adapted to the opinion of individuals the absurdity of persecution our pretensions to divine and the bounds of human knowledge epistle the third  page         on the infatuation of mankind respecting paradox and mysteries the effects and causes of such infatuation the absurdity of supposing ignorance and folly the means to promote the cause of truth or that the freedom of scientifick inquiry is incompatible with the political welfare of society epistle the fourth  page          on the weakness of the human understanding the abstract existence of the deity the incomprehensibility of the divine nature and the incongruity of pretended atheism epistle the fifth  page       0  on happiness the apparent incapacity of mankind for its enjoyment the comparative pain and pleasure of human sensations and their relation to our physical and moral constitution epistle the sixth  page  0       on abstract good and evil the physical perfection of the material universe and the moral harmony observable in the dispensations of providence epistle the seventh  page          on moral principles the respective influence of reason and the passions the immorality of ignorance and the indispensable duty of seeking knowledge epistle the eighth  page  0       on the immortality of the soul and the arments for and against a future state  epistle the first  argument of truth in general  its criterion  its relation to opinion  the uncertainty of the latter  necessary that both should concur in science  summary universal belief being in fact an undisputed criterion of truth and all mankind necessarily believing those positions which they conceive demonstrable science or demonstrative knowledge is supposed to be the least exceptionable test of what is true or false in general  the abstract certitude of the schools is therefore exploded but as particular opinions are not always the effect of knowledge nor are systems constantly founded on scientifick principles it is inquired if there be no other criterion sufficiently obvious to relieve the doubts and reconcile the opposite sentiments of mankind  the dispensations of providence as well as the dictates of revelation appear inadequate to the purpose theologists being found too unsucceessful in clearing up the sacred page and phisiologists too ignorant of the system of nature for either to form opinions equally adapted to the credulity of individuals  divines and philosophers are censured indeed rather as mercenary wranglers or bigots to particular systems than fair inquirers after or teachers of the truth  a fair and ingenuous inquirer uncharacterized  such not frequently to be found few being capacitated for so arduous a task  fortitude and moderation the grand requisites the scarcity of which in the minds of men in general serves to account for their want of success in the attempt as well as for their promptitude either to embrace skepticism as an antidote to error or conformity to avoid the trouble of thinking  dogmatists and skepticks censured the former on account of their absurd dependence on tradition and futile authorities the latter for superciliously rejecting on the other hand all authority and tradition without distinction  in our inquiries after truth however our belief is to be suspended in regard to points beyond our knowledge  in scientifick researches also the subtilty of metaphysical arguments should be with caution trusted as insensibly leading us into error and perplexity  epistle the first while zeal beyond the grave pursues whom priest and patriot abuse with some the fostersire of lies extolled by others to the skies st john the late lord viscount bolingbroke  thus saved and damned by fame an honored and a blasted name lorenzo asks ingenuous youth what is and who believes the truth the truth my friend would learn of me it is that wherein mankind agree at least no safer truth we know than that the world will grant us so but when and where  the sages tell of yore twas buried in a well a trite saying of democritus  so deep that hid for want of light from every peeping mortals sight the more suspicious than the rest conceived the story was a jest and as no soul could find it out that truth itself was all a doubt philosophizing train of thought since by improving moderns caught who tell us nature tricked mankind when giving eyes she left us blind heaven making fools and thinking fit we know not says descartes whether god has not created us in such a manner that we are constantly deceived even as to things the most palpable and evident  to play upon their want of wit but sure we boldly may receive as truth what all mankind believe such universal faith a guide in skepticism itself implied yet say in what the world unite else useless this our rule of right else still inquirys at a pause still vague investigations laws lorenzo all with you and me in points demonstrable agree conviction right or wrong the test as the supposed demonstration may be either false or true it being sufficient to our argument that all mankind agree to call that truth which but appears to be demonstrated  of truth in every human breast while truths demonstratively so who once believe profess to know on science hence our search must rest that universal rule confessed laid then those subtilties aside where human certitudes denied inquiry safely may proceed to form its scientifick creed does solomon himself profess his science all uncertain guess forced by reflective reason i confess that human science is uncertain guess priors solomon  thegregious sophister affirms a contradiction even in terms who can his ignorance suppose of that he is conscious that he knows or according to monsieur huet if we do not allow that to be evident which actually appears so truth and falsehood are equally demonstrable and we may add knowledge and ignorance synonymous terms  say thou slow knowledge faith outflies believers spurning at the wise opinion winged feet hand and head in haste without her errand sped or driven inactive here and there with every vagrant breath of air would therefore know what systems err to whom opinions to refer

she laid to truth her artful claim yet once secure the cunning jade gave up its temporary aid playing again her mothers game with priests of every church the same as the word priest is not frequently used in common discourse to signify a protestant divine so neither has it here such an indiscriminate implication meaning such only as lay claim to that title by their maintaining the tenets of church

the ingenious bishop of avranches choppd logic as dexterously on the subject yet alas such is the perverseness of commonsense that the greatest part of mankind even to this day do insist on the certainty of their knowing the right hand from the left  for ignorance to sooth its pride must seek its own defects to hide affecting hence all unbelief is scoto infidel in chief his hand and heart

argument on science as our guide to truth  the criterion best adapted to the opinion of individuals  the absurdity of persecution  our pretensions to divine and the bounds of human knowledge  summary science though admitted as the rule of faith in matters relating to the investigation of truth is neither exclusive nor universal affecting only our opinion in speculative points for however refined are our credenda we insensibly join in our practical notions with the rest of mankind  whatever objection therefore scientifick inquirers may make to the systems of others none can be made to their fixing the criterion of truth on knowledge the certainty of which is by implication admitted in the general pretensions of mankind to commonsense  this is the privilege of every mind without distinction enabling us equally to draw like conclusions from like premises  all actual dispute therefore arises from some misunderstanding or different acceptance of the matter in question as the most ignorant peasant is equally certain of the proofs he comprehends with the greatest philosopher  for the same reason nevertheless those would be engaged in a desperate undertaking who should attempt to reconcile mankind to any one system of opinion the capacity and credulity of individuals being so very different in consequence of their diversity of temperament education and experience  it is injurious and ridiculous therefore to insult others for thinking in the manner we ourselves should have done under the same circumstances  it is still more absurd to reprobate the rest of mankind for not believing what we ourselves do not nor can possibly be made to believe as is the case when we would impose tenets that either contradict themselves or are in fact downright nonsense  for it is impossible to believe apparent falsehood or to be convinced of any thing by a set of words that convey no determinate meaning  mysterious or unintelligible propositions cannot therefore be believed  if the truth of revelation in general be admitted as what is revealed from heaven must undoubtedly be true the difficulty of knowing what is particularly so or who are the truly inspired is yet inexplicably great  though the power of working miracles also be allowed a proof of inspiration in the agent the fallacy of pretended ones and the supposed inspiration of impostors are almost invincible obstacles to our discovery of the truth  the supposition also that real miracles are transgressions of the laws of nature is not at all necessary to support their veracity but argues the contrary and implies an injurious reflection on the omnipotence and prescience of the deity  whatever reasonable objections however we may have against putting implicit faith in either pretended miracles or revelation yet as the utmost extent of scientifick discovery falls so infinitely short of a perfect knowledge of the designs and operations of nature we cannot philosophically deny that god sometimes produces effects for ends best known to himself by means wholly unknown to us  to proceed nevertheless in our inquiries on the most certain grounds the criterion of science is to be neglected only in points indisputably and intelligibly revealed  epistle the second nor to the fount of hippocrene nor groves of laurel ever green nor where the wanton graces stray with flowers is strown the muses way lorenzo no i more rejoice at reasons bold and manly voice than at the softest sprightliest air mirth ever sung to lighten care truths sober tale more pleased to hear than all that

in thy search to err if placed thy faith on points alone whose truth demonstratively known these much too few and too confined to serve the purpose of mankind let a trite moral here advise be not more

yourself commend see the beginning of the first epistle  lorenzo see to commonsense by commonsense is not meant any set of principles or method of logicizing established by custom but an innate capacity in all mankind to reason or draw conclusions from what they hear and see  how just how general the pretense to nation climate age or sect unlimited without respect whence howsoever wide we

fierce and cambrian stout the boor that rhynlands polder drains though reason slumber in his brains all all like premises in view premises not only alike in terms but whose terms are alike understood  the like conclusions ever drew for know that like our mother earth its human offspring at its birth where fertile clay and barren sand compose the variegated land the unequal strata of the soil unequally demand our toil the rich that toil with gain repay thrown on the poor our pains away in mans uncultivated mind so varied is the soil in kind the flowers of science fresh and fair on some expand without our care on others scarce by culture grow the buds that wither as they blow yet here essentially allied however else diversified the fertile marl the steril sand alike the seed or plant demand denied no more spontaneous grain to bergens rocks than baioes plain the country near baioe celebrated by pliny and others as the most fruitful part of italy nullus in orb locus says horace baiis praelucet amoenis agreeable to the above sentiment it is at present called terra di lavoro  so not a truth innate our own though we have not all by nature an equal capacity to acquire knowledge our minds may nevertheless be justly considered as originally tabuloe rasoe in which there may be a very essential difference however as to their aptitude for impression  the seeds of knowledge must be sown experience slow must swell the root and tend the fibers as they shoot or speedier aid instruction grant and slips of foreign growth implant the mental and material claim here too essentially the same grow seed or plant wherever it will in kind it is propagated still no soil nor climate can produce in tares the barleys potent juice to thorns no culture can assign the purple honors of the vine thus when by simple natures aid put forth sensations tender blade if to perfection nearer brought it bloom and ripen into thought wherever situate the root the same its intellectual fruit its taste its form perhaps we blame but still its genus is the same in this no poverty of soil no dullness ever mocked our toil if vainly then in lettered pride the scholar deep is dignified so false so empty the pretense of wits to more than commonsense if plain to the idiot as to you the immediate object of his view while even the blockhead truly knows far as his little science goes consistent sure our confidence in search of truth on commonsense that general index to mankind see epistle the first  to taste and genius unconfined pointing in all one common way by dullness shortened but its ray of wit and knowledge all the end in length that radius to extend in stubborn age or pliant youth its bearing in the line of truth a needle constant to the pole whence beams true faith upon the soul do thou object if commonsense so plausible an evidence and all mankind of this possessed that any differ from the rest know thou when honest minds dissent misunderstood their argument different the premises appear else were the fixed deduction clear hence half our numerous quarrels rise we see not with each others eyes so that precisely all alike nor terms nor things conception strike for every individual draws his plan by mere perspective laws fixed to one station time and place in power no full survey to trace the false mistaking often for true observed at different points of view so when to cheat the partial sight and prove in mirth that black is white with lights disposed the shades between in folds is spread the artful scene opposed the colors strike the eye and he affirms what you deny here spotless all appears and fair perceived a total blackness there the demonstration of his sight who doubts who knows not black from white thus evidence supports dispute nor one the other can refute and yet is commonsense to blame the premises were not the same were these alike though say you err both would infallibly concur for take each others point of sight and set at once the matter right from the consideration of the different appearances of circumstances and things to different minds many of the academicks fagaciously concluded there was no criterion whereby we might distinguish between reality and appearance truth and falsehood a deduction ridiculous enough for in the words of mr pope if black and white blend soften and unite a thousand ways is there no black or white   conceive not then because we find one source of truth in every mind we individuals think to see at every time and place agree as well amidst yon grove of trees while plays a constant eastern breeze each single spray we hope to find in one direction west reclined for though to truth alike our claim our taste nor sentiments the same for dusky green the jaundicd eye mistakes the clearblue summer sky the distant scene however bright is darkness to the short of sight to loaded ears as whispers still the clack and thunder of the mill thus lost as colors on the blind on dullness qualities refined than music to the deaf no more to ignorance the abstracted lore hence often objection calls us out to satisfy the blockheads doubt who not one proof whereon depends his sought solution comprehends tous ceux says a certain french author qui sont capable de fair des objectons ne sont pas toujours en etat de comprendre tous les principes dont depend la resolution de leurs objections  the tritest arguments of yore in vain repeated over and over proving how fruitless were the toil the jarring world to reconcile and yet as but from time and place our several modes of thought we trace alas how blindly do we run each others heresy to shun our own our glory and our pride while curses all the rest betide by pious children doomed their sire by sires their children to hellfire heirs to salvations brighter sphere so strangely damned and damning here thus calvin ignorantly raves at souls which therefore luther saves to both denied lord peters keys who shuts out heretics like these and yet even those who boast to feel their bosoms burn with christian zeal who dooming mussulmen to hell with pride uncharitable swell in nazreth bred or bethlem born had laughed our saviors birth to scorn mere turks denounced for you and me the bitter fruit of zacons tree to eat with fiends below the doom of antimahomet and rome yet blind as sampson when despair had sunk his life below his care the numbers wanton gaza lost destroyed but at his proper cost halfwitted zeal of all the test itself condemns among the rest for if required by gracious heaven our service but as knowledge given should i in pope or mufti trust for proving to their tenets just your rule to censure me or mine holds the like condemnation thine therefore thou art inexcusable o man whosoever thou art that judge for wherein thou judge another thou condemnest thy self  yet still more wicked weak and blind this reprobating zeal we find when void of truth absurd and vain the tenets zealots thus maintain oh how ridiculous and odd that zeal precipitate for god so short of knowledge i bear them record says st paul of the jews that they have a zeal of god but not according to knowledge that indeed it understands not even its creed for know whatever the world pretend but few believe what they defend in modes of faith though falsehood taught nonsense is equally their fault thousands by forms of speech deceived never yet by mortal man believed creeds penned as said at heavens command in terms no soul can understand or such though thundered from on high that plainly give themselves the lie but sure if words no sense convey faith in their uttrance dies away nor can a single son of eve apparent falsehood ever believe a man may perhaps believe a proposition to be true though he cannot conceive how it can possibly be so but he never can sincerely believe a position that contradicts itself or is evidently false  thus i may believe that one man has raised another from the dead though i cannot understand by what means it can possibly be true but i can never actually believe that two are but one and that the same one is at the same time two because it is a contradiction in terms and apparently impossible  belief no vague declaimers rant no bigots creed no sophists cant it is not the scripture text to quote to get our catechism by rote over homilies to spend the day at midnight half asleep to pray to chatter matins at the dawn or gabble with the man of lawn true faith that consciousness of soul that times nor accidents control save those adapted and combined to root conviction from the mind for know that neither threats nor blows sincere belief can ever impose the monks hot zeal the jesuits skill lead not conviction as they will go turn inquisitor and burn the heretics all round in turn the turk refusing to resign his sensual paradise for thine the indian that in death pretends to visit but his former friends unless his faith what you may tell of joys in heaven and pains in hell not one of all the suffering tribe thy sentiments perforce imbibe however induced by hope or fear the mind is no free agent here to change their faith beyond the power of martyrs at their dying hour how idly then enthusiasts rave of systems that will damn or save or think true proselytes to gain by torture gallows whip or chain since ever constant to its cause true faith depends on natures laws by nonsense nor caprice misled the honest heart and sober head how idly wild fanatics preach while ignorant of what they teach the spirit never affects the mind unless with the understanding joined nor has the word if void of sense to gospel power the least pretense the nonsense of our modern saints is therefore equally reprehensible with the affectation of speaking in unknown tongues so severely censured in the apostles first letter to the cor chap     some certain meaning hence and plain a saving faith must needs contain if fixed its object sure no less the sense of terms our creed express a parrot else if none deceive her a sound and orthodox believer convinced as much as ever yet the athanasian paroquet that the athanasians believe nothing by the creed they profess might be perhaps too harsh to say as we confess that after the way which they call heresy we believe it ourselves but that they deceive themselves in supposing they really believe what they say is for the above reasons very evident  let not fanaticism deceive none can a mystery believe that is a mysterious or nonintelligible proposition as the real assent or dissent of the mind must necessarily succeed some determinate conception of the premises laid down so that no man can possibly believe a position he does not understand  though plunged by zeal in error deep while commonsense lies fast asleep their faith rash bigots strangely boast the strongest his who is cheated most who least for truth presumes to search but headlong runs into the church for laid thy hand upon thy heart the formule of thy creed impart do thou its substance comprehend lo all its mysterys at an end in spite of their misguiding zeal here to their hearts let all appeal enough if just be their pretense to honesty and commonsense here rests that umpire of mankind conscience the god within the mind at eastern temples as of yore without the threshold of the door in reverence did the zealot use to doff and leave his dirty shoes like him the modern faithful taught that reason is a thing of naught lest they should soil the church with doubt their understandings leave without for ask who thus in mystery trust if euclids demonstrations just if truth the geometrick art or subtle algebra impart unknowing what precisely meant they honestly resuse assent consess they first must comprehend before they credit or contend o self condemned o dead to shame have these a conscience void of blame who take no worldly points on trust but scruple till they know them just yet their supreme concerns will rest on tenets half the world contest conviction openly defy and with their tongues their hearts belie these the true faithful shall we call these have alas no faith at all for howsoeer with art they strive to keep absurdity alive clothed in equivocal disguise or garb of truth their specious lies still commonsense unrooted out will find a flaw to fix a doubt and where one doubt is left behind no firm belief informs the mind yet is there whose officious zeal pretends a consciousness to feel a fixed internal evidence of axioms hid from commonsense a stronger testimony given by inspiration breathed from heaven lorenzo neither you nor i what god reveals can ever deny but here how needful to be wise to know where revelation lies art thou thyself inspired by heaven tell me what certain proof is given do thou intuitively view what reason tells thee must be true no revelation here required how proves such truth that you are inspired for why inspired if but to tell what reason might have told as well as truth beholds thy mental eye what seems to all the world a lie thy proof imagination strong here also may thou still be wrong from heaven if ever fired conceit brandy has also done the feat nay often the infatuate of brain of heavens presumed injunctions vain have madly broke its dread commands and dipped in blood their murdering hands if god or devil then inspire of reason still we must inquire and reason doubtless would reply heaven never yet revealed a lie on others gifts confiding more do give thine own pretensions over do from the inspired thy faith receive and pin it on thy neighbors sleeve reason or heaven must tell thee too if such be more inspired than you where then the proof i frankly own to me yet uninspird unknown such guides to me by madness fired as madmen more properly perhaps idiots the sentiment as it thus stands is dr whichcotes with the turks inspired in spite of middleton and hume do thou on miracles presume to revelation these thy guide thy faith by wonders verified go thou and easy of belief my comrade ask if i am a thief if inspiration false and true sure miracles suspicious too and hence thy conduct most absurd to take for one the others word our souls how long to damn and save has subtle priestcraft played the knave its pupils trained from early youth tequivocate and hide the truth to practice the deception nice of tricking hand or quaint device to cheat the palate nose and eye and gild that dirty pill a lie yet do thou miracles maintain be here thy definition plain the muse disdaining to reply to such as shock the naked eye i e palpable impostures  events as miracles do own whose cause immediate is unknown or is thy faith established more on actions never performed before alas my much believing friend the times of yore might these defend when heretic freethinkers rose that dared the holy church oppose for infidelity renowned asserting that the globe was round vile heresy whence doomed to hell upsals good bishop martyr fell wretches so impious as to hold the earth about its axis rolled and as the years their courses run still took its journeys round the sun vile heresy for which it is said old galileo too had bled had not the sage more loath to die recanting damned it for a lie according to the terms of abjuration ego galileo cord sincero et fide non ficta abjuro maledico et detestor supradictos errores et baereses  in days of ignorance like these when legends had the power to please while love of wonder salvd deceit and gudgeons swallowed whole the cheat how little strange that monks and friars should prove miraculously liars or converts to divines so sad turn out miraculously mad but now a century worn away time working wonders every day the vast discovries years have made have spoilt the wondermongers trade say thou events so strange of yore since now miraculous no more true miracles thou would define as real acts of power divine the effects of some immediate cause in fact transgressing natures laws this is mr humes definition of a miracle to which however we do not subscribe as it appears to us to supersede the very possibility of miracles the reality of which cannot be philosophically denied as from several late discoveries it appears that the knowledge of mankind in physical causes and effects is not sufficiently extensive to establish a negative against any pretended phenomenon whatever it should be considered also that the truth of miracles does not depend on the reality of the facts represented but on the veracity of that representation neither does the certainty of the fact appear at all needful to the end for which miracles were confessedly intended for the apparent effect of a supernatural power would have the same influence on the spectator as a real one as it is by appearance only we judge of reality  how  did the omnipotent on high let those his laws at random fly or was his providence so blind to what omnisciency designed that still his sovereign will attends to strike his foes or skreen his friends that power beyond the almightys art to natures system to impart needful heavens arbitrary fire to blast a fig tree or a liar lorenzo be not thou so vain to think thus brittle natures chain from which whatever link we strike tenth or ten thousandth broke alike see popes essay on man epis i ver      connecting systems all destroyed unballancd worlds would strew the void to atoms burst restored again old chaos to his ancient reign unless in time the god attend the works of his own hand to mend alas how blasphemous to say that heaven can save no other way or that for trifles or in joke creations sacred orders broke the accounts given us of the miracles of our savior and his apostles cannot however be denied whether we suppose the facts really or only apparently to have happened as in either case the perceptible effects might flow from natural causes unknown to philosophy yet adapted in the general system of things to answer the ends of providence  for do we not in fact confess if god may natures laws transgress the wise creator wanted skill his vast intentions to fulfill or that the intention though his own was in the extent to him unknown or still more impiously imply that heaven can give itself the lie say then that miracles there be they are but miraculous to thee so many links concealed remain which form the complicated chain true causes and effects between in natures providential scene what though without an obvious cause we see inverted customs laws must we immediately infer that nature from itself can err commanded by the word divine say water changed itself to wine graves opened wide their ponderous jaws a breath the sole apparent cause ah who shall boast that god revere creations laws were broken here it cannot be denied indeed but god may act praeter though not contra scientiam naturae the supposition however is not at all necessary to justify our belief in miracles  might not ten thousand springs unite causes too fine for mortal sight such varied wonders to produce to providential ends of use formed when by heaven its power displayed the earths foundation first was laid or when that logos the word st john chap i was designed by miracles to save mankind think not lorenzo nature strays whenever the world is in amaze extend thy view from pole to pole see one great miracle the whole where all events their cause succeed as once the great first cause decreed where order still from order flows and never interruption knows capricious but to mortal sense the harmony of providence how strangely therefore bigots err who wonders to plain facts prefer with listening ear who love to range and greedy eye for all that is strange rejecting their creators plan the voice of god for that of man besides thy miracles confined to former ages of mankind nature in these our latter days unmoved by prayer and deaf to praise never turning back nor led aside to help our wants or sooth our pride but keeping packhorse like its track bearing the world upon its back say such to revelation guide for these on hearsay we confide in want of proof on trust must take for honest jew or gentiles sake since howsoeer the truth concealed none trust in miracles revealed unless learned jortins or rather that of maimonides a jew of whom dr jortin says he borrowed it the interpretation however is ingenious and the dr has made the best on it he supposes balaam was in a trance or vision scheme may pass of dreaming balaams talking ass do thou secure historians trust how know we if their tale be just from numerous causes prone to err dubious alas what these aver what from deception ever can save the man whose trust is in a knave to falsehood he how often a tool whose confidence is in a fool and should themselves the honest speak the honest may be blind or weak be led a visionary dance like peter in prophetic trance see acts chap    and     or good st paul that seldom knew if

wild opinions they from truth are blindly led astray who like old wives in winter nights hear see and feel and chat with sprights their prudent caution therefore just who waking dreamers seldom trust to whom light visions fact may seem and fact itself an idle dream in reverence yet we all must own the power and will of god unknown confined not to the narrow bound of reasons most extensive round

such infatuation  the absurdity of supposing ignorance and folly the means to promote the cause of truth or that the freedom of scientifick enquiry is incompatible with the political welfare of society  summary it is remarkable that notwithstanding the universality of those truths which are founded on commonsense mankind have ever been so infatuated as to reject this general and obvious criterion for the more particular dogmas and mysterious paradoxes of pretended revelation  the moral effects of this infatuation exemplified in our superficial attachment to religion our indolent security in time of prosperity and our transitory astonishment and penitence under the immediate weight of misfortune  an absurd scheme of education the grand cause of that cowardice and imbecility of mind which render us so ridiculous in speculation and inconsistent in practice  the misapplication of their talents therefore who think by increasing such weakness to promote the cause of truth or the interest of religion and morality is placed in a ridiculous light as the just object of censure  the supposition also that ignorance and implicit subjection to authority are necessary to the wellbeing of society or the political happiness of mankind is exploded and shown to be exemplarily false and absurd polity in general as well as religion and private virtue in particulars being founded on truth and nature and not dependant on the chimerical productions of fancy the low artifices of faction or the knavish cunning of designing falsehood  epistle the third if truth in science we may find its root implanted in the mind to this so just the worlds pretense on the plain rules of commonsense our mental faculties to abuse how prostituted is the muse how long have childish bards too long their

with their chains her slaves have writ and all the labored pomp of verse employed her fables to rehearse while thou o sacred truth remain the theme of every humbler strain and yet if true what each pretends how numerous are her rhyming friends while such her fond admirers prove and tune their rival songs to love but fools in fondness as in awe the truth it is plain they never saw and but themselves her lovers boast because her name the public toast so smit with sacred truth and rhyme the bard and sophist of the time monsieur de voltaire remarkable for his regard to truth and the profundity of his philosophical speculations  long played by turns the wit and fool the monarchs and the printers tool the jest the genius of the age till hissed and pelted off the stage whence now no

unrivaled yet how honored might not truth accuse thy venal prostiuted muse say thou it is strange the world should rest content by falsehood thus depressed alas thou little know mankind that seeing imitate the blind in spite of truth and open day in darkness choose to grope their way suspecting plainness of disguise the obvious sense of terms despise from sound or derivation gleaning some hardword deuteroscope meaning while each impostors word prevails in mystic parables and tales neglected even the voice of heaven when rational instructions given look back through each successive age how honored the mysterious page what millions have been made the tools of knaves whose natural prey are fools how strangely tricked deluded crowds who truth expecting from the clouds and therefore gaping up in the air on error stumbled unaware thus an astrologer of old in learned history we are told contemplating the milky way neglected that before him lay and led by wandering planets fell unluckily into a well yet ever with slander branding those who sought the naked truth to expose short sighted mortals in their pride thus strove their ignorance to hide by holding all beyond their view beyond investigation too lorenzo our misfortune here the effect of idleness and fear the sluggard shuns inquirys task because too great the pains to ask stifling the emotions of his breast to indulge his lazy brains in rest a paradox yet such the fact more fear to think than fear to act in thought though danger we surmize in act while real danger lies mr hume  in truth my friend it is sad to find hence rise the zeal of half mankind religion but the compound vice of indolence and cowardice even pious christians much i fear often practically atheists here how deaf and blind to calls of grace when nature wears a smiling face but when she frowns in wild amaze look how the affrighted cowards gaze when clouds drop fatness on the plains in mildly soft descending rains in their due season harvests smile and plenty crowns the peasants toil as nothing rare as nothing new we take the blessing as our due for o prosperitys a lot at ease enjoyed with ease forgot in junes warm sun and aprils

tall mountain bows its head and earthquakes vomit up the dead behold whole nations prostrate fall before the mighty god of all to appease his anger now their care lo all is fasting sighs and prayer

incongruity of pretended atheism  summary as it is necessary to our success in scientifick researches that the mind should be divested of its prejudices in favor of tradition and custom so however extensive be the freedom of enquiry it is equally necessary that the object of investigation be adapted to the limits of the understanding mankind always falling into error and confusion in their attempts to discover the knowledge of things beyond their capacity however true therefore may be many of our discoveries in the system of nature god the author of that system is abstracted from it and above our comprehension  hence our pretensions to describe or define the deity are palpably absurd and ridiculous for though a created being may ascribe to its creator the most respectable of all known perfections yet as all its ideas of perfection are relative to itself the attributes human beings ascribe to god are necessarily the superior qualities of humanity  notwithstanding however the deity is so far removed from our enquiries and thereby confessedly no object of philosophical knowledge yet the actual disbelief of the existence of a god is denied the arguments for and against atheists composing in fact a very ridiculous dispute as the impossibility of denying the being of a first cause is evident and the rest of the controversy a mere cavil about words of no determinate meaning  epistle the fourth ruled by no giant hopes or fears whose stature grows with length of years in search of truth expect to find the labor suited to the mind with genius nature bearing part the

acquiesce that thou thy infinite express idly does bolingbroke refine granting that wisdom is divine while as absurdly he denies justice and goodness to the skies ideas equally our own our goodness as our wisdoms known to both as hard to reconcile or natures frown or natures smile alas no attributes of thine can ever the deity define impossible to judge or know of god above from man below at least so far as to judge of his providential designs or ultimate determinations from our supposed knowledge of his attributes for how shall we know what may be consistent or inconsistent with gods justice

relation to our physical and moral constitution  summary next to the absurdity of puzzling ourselves in the investigation of matters beyond our capacity and equally an obstacle to our inquiries after truth is the folly of our constant pursuit and in spite of as constant disappointments our expectations of happiness  the term is certainly left vague and illdefind even by those philosophers who pretending it to be attainable affect to teach us how happiness may be acquired  its meaning is nevertheless obvious and is determined from the tenor of its acceptance with the generality of mankind in which sense it is shown to be hitherto unattaind and that not only from the impossibility of externals to confer happiness but from the evident incapacity of human beings to be made happy  it is hence also declared unattainable and even the most laudable means whereby it is pursued as those of knowledge religion and virtue are experimentally and logically shown to be incapable of conferring happiness  in fact every state age and condition of life having its several distinct anxieties and consolations it appears that a continued sense of either happiness or misery is incompatible with our nature as well as with the very essence of pleasure and pain in general our sensations of both which are merely comparative and reciprocally necessary to that of each other whence happiness and misery are evidently relative to and dependant on the constitution of the human frame with which abstract pain and pleasure are totally inconsistent  epistle the fifth beyond the science of mankind in natures fane our god enshrined content lorenzo let us trace the lines the shadow of his face in humble boldness seek to know our heaven on earth our god below to face the sun to beat the sky demand an eagles wing and eye ah let not then mere birds of night whose wings whose optics check their flight encouraged by the morning ray to risk the sunshine of the day their feeble powers too highly rate

daring flight born up on scientifick wing attempts her boldest note to sing for thee those winding tracts texplore where seldom muse has dared to soar but here as truth we hope to find be left each vain desire behind be thrown those obstacles aside which expectation builds on pride while busy hope and bustling care erect their castles in the air our fertile wishes safe to hold fertile in pleasure fame or gold a treasure valued at no less than mans consummate happiness for know if bliss thy end and aim truth but invalidates thy claim the exclusive privilege to know the all we taste of heaven below is this a maxim wits profess that man was born to happiness though towers of hope he fondly raise their structure lasts him all his days in expectation even possessing the better half of every blessing his bliss for ever in his view whenever he pleases to pursue my friend with care such maxims weigh nor run with giddy wits astray in search of truth may genius roam but bliss if found is found at home to region clime nor soil confined this boasted seed of heavenly kind ah vainly boasted if below the plant celestial cannot grow say sophists neither more nor less than happiness is happiness yet will they boast this state unknown this bliss indefinite their own the difference plain twixt bliss and woe whatever we feel we surely know what state can then be ever thine which sense nor science can define that man by others is it confessed never is but always to be blessed yet would they teach in moral strain how all may happiness attain as well who never was blessed with light may boast the happiness of sight the splendor of the solar ray or teach his comrades blind their way as such to thee make ever known a state of being never their own do thou to prove my judgment wrong in answer quote thy favorite song true bliss thy pope if we believe all hands can reach all heads conceive see popes essay on man  the happiness of each confined in truth to that of all our kind know terms so general naught define the bliss of all nor yours nor mine as yet distinctly understood the public and the private good nor does it prove this maxim right to say that both in one unite unless their union be so plain that seeking one we both obtain since thindividual for himself applies to riot fame or pelf in spite of all the wise can say we seek our bliss a separate way just as the present maggots bite take our own measures for the right or having no peculiar whim along the tide of custom swim meanwhile of bliss though all dispute none leave their darling substitute how short of happiness is gold the miser cries yet keeps his hold in women sighs the battered rake what solid comfort can we take ah what in wine silenus asks yet cart the whore go stave the casks how shall the sons of comus live if wine nor women life does give thus public happiness our care but for our own peculiar share while sons their fathers schemes traduce and here all patriotism abuse however then the specious face of wit may countenance the case bliss inconsistently we call the happiness of one and all nor is it yet precisely meant by good ease pleasure or content good might we variously explain ease is deliverance but from pain pleasure is actual joy confessed and mere content but patient rest a neutral state at best and worst but negatively blessed or cursed that which our happiness we call though that nor this the sum of all the worlds plain meaning plainly this some constant state of actual bliss no matter whether in degree alike bestowed on you or me enough if void of fear or pain no motive lead us to complain enough whatever the mode of joy if such that it can never cloy look round the world and tell me true where is such happiness in view from monarchs fled as sings the bard his patrons virtue to reward tell me in truth was st john blessed see essay on man ep    or did the bitter bard but jest dipping his pen in worse than gall an outed statesman blessed to call with equal truth the muse might paint my lord of bolingbroke a saint run riot over his dubious fame and dub him with a patriots name so worthy of his countrys praise so meek so holy all his ways nor though

here or there reside the mortal free from care you ask in vain for joy and strife diversify all states of life to wield the scythe with sweaty brow with wearied arm to guide the plough to sow in hope to reap in joy thine labor is the sweet employ a life of rest with pain to endure to seek in health diseases cure to eat the grape unprund the vine laborious idleness is thine yet idleness of care complains and labor quarrels with its pains nor only found or made distress because externals fail to bless lodged in ourselves the taste and will that make externals good or ill no earthly blessing hence we find an equal good to all mankind belmore the soberst thing on earth dreads the broad laugh and roar of mirth while clerrio with a length of chin protracted by perpetual grin though socrates himself pass by must laugh in ridicule or die how elegant how high refined the palate of cardellas mind how low how vulgar cottas soul that feels no rapture in a vole see thousands as in love with strife pursue it fretting all their life and darken with the clouds of spleen the sky of providence serene wretched to find another eased and most unhappy when they are pleased how strange while some with patient toil raise comfort on a barren soil or pleasure strike by native dint from cruel fortunes hardest flint the patriarch like whose rod we are told earths stubborn fetters burst of old when gushed the stream from horebs rock to water israels thirsty flock hence not on earth a blessing sent gives universally content for while so varied is our taste manna itself were showrd to waste with reason therefore we profess god meant not here our happiness else in the various blessings given sure various minds might find their heaven if says mr pope  to all men happiness was meant god in externals could not place content to me i must confess the various conditions of humanlife seem so admirably adapted to the several dispositions ofindividuals that if our happiness in this life were intended the unequal distribution of the gifts of fortune affords themost plausible means to effect it  but know as different we find each individuals turn of mind as little with ourselves we see ourselves at various times agree so often our views our tempers change as through lifes varied scenes we range at times so different from himself the prodigal will hoard his pelf spend greedily the night at play to throw next morn his gains away at times even misers rob their store and give their sixpence to the poor at times even trembling cowards fight and desperate put the bold to flight while sick of fighting and of fame the brave like belgic lions tame how often my friend in private life we love the maid we hate a wife how often the scene that gives delight at morn offends the eye at night it is not the want of that or this possession is the bane of bliss and hence of happiness we see on earth the impossibility yet with an interested view does still lorenzo truth pursue do thou suppose thenlightend mind in truths researches bliss may find that science fancy may restrain and fix that weathercock the brain alas deceive thy self no more but give thy vain pretensions over for as a world of fruitless cost in vain inquiries has been lost a world of labor spent tattain to knowledge man may never gain so millions all their lives have spent searching for bliss in discontent for bliss which but a little thought had told them never could be taught yet still they ask yet still they run a race that never can be won thus sought of yore projecting fools the summum bonum of the schools and wiser heads than those of old the stone converting all to gold or vain adepts much wiser still to wrest from natures hand at will promethean theft celestial fire to animate their wood and wire madmen that not monro could cure of circles and their quadrature of thinking drunken nature reels like a slung coach on springs and wheels do thou instructed in thy youth to place consummate bliss in truth conceive it somewhere hidden lies among the learned and the wise that hence our bliss or misery flow the truth to know or not to know in vain the learned in science deep in search of bliss their vigils keep in vain the universe explore swift as their search it flies before through every clime on every wind and leaves the panting wish behind o tell me what connection ties so close the happy and the wise did ever the sage in wisdom find the artless infants peace of mind proud knowledge ever or boastful art restore to joy the broken heart ah what avails the truth to know when truths the frequent source of woe while gilded fictions dazzling rays with sunshine beautify our days or mildly shed its silver beams reflected light our nightly dreams while pleasure and its laughing train dance by the moonshine of the brain for what is knowledge but to know how ignorant our state below the more we learn the more to find beyond our learning still behind our fruitless wishes to increase whenever our mental prospects cease so far from happiness my friend is science in its means or end say thou that bliss the world affect the smile of god on his elect confined to abrams faithful seed and made dependant on our creed go ask the saints to whom are given the best assurances of heaven the few distinguished here on earth as children of a spiritual birth how gloomy often a state of grace how often hid their makers face how often by satan and by sin sore buffeted the man within these all confess beyond the sky their blissful heritage does lie say is reposed this heavenly trust within the bosom of the just while virtue in itself you call the happiness of one and all pretending still though yours and mine no partial mode of bliss define yet that our different tastes unite in meaning well and thinking right an universal moral this conducting all mankind to bliss alas what sophistry to tell of thinking right and meaning well pope  unless this rectitude of thought with perspicuity be taught this honest meaning plainly shown so often admired so little known at virtue if we are left to guess what is it to say it is happiness the way to virtue as to bliss if dubious that as doubtful this how fruitless therefore but to know virtue is happiness below say thou mankind are all agreed that happiness is virtues meed the service of the work inquire and by the labor rate the hire now virtue some to fact confine while others place it in design these blessed but for the good they do and those for all they have in view but if by virtue understood the mere intent of doing good those fully virtuous may be held who never one lawless passion quelled whom never temptation led astray beyond the tenor of their way a sober path by stoics trod nor friends to man nor foes to god consistent with a state of rest if virtues centred in the breast as happy those may surely live who nothing give nor have to give as those who taste in eyry sense the exertion of benevolence some seeming difference yet we find what pangs affect the tender mind what exquisite sensations rise to hear the orphans piteous cries to feel the widows piercing woe when no relief our wants bestow does virtue here rejoice the heart as when the generous ease impart when purest transports warm the breast that glows to succor the distressed and yet my friend twere wondrous hard if bliss the virtuous rich reward in poverty that virtues zeal should double all the pangs we feel each generous sigh each social tear but render want the more severe to virtue therefore if the deed our best designs must yet succeed granting that happy every mind in such proportion as its kind here in externals do we place the happiness of human race enabled to relieve distress as wealth or power ourselves possess for bliss capacitated more as blessed with fortunes worldly store fixed by this scheme the blissful state exclusive to the rich and great the virtuous poor but innocent claim at the utmost bare content besides if individuals blessed as sharers only with the rest true happiness with thee to call not merely that of one but all what is inactive virtues use can it to social good conduce can it thus fruitless and confined be called a blessing to mankind if then we judge so much amiss of virtue and of virtuous bliss if faith though crowned with alms and prayers has all its pangs has all its cares while even from knowledge prospects rise that make us miserably wise his perfect happiness to reach no morals mortal man can teach still heavens best votries must confess no blessings here completely bless a compound strange of bliss and woe mans variable state below some absent something ours to crave even from the cradle to the grave how idly then employed the mind in search of that we cannot find for human bliss stands never still our good inseprable from ill virtue says mr pope is the  point where human bliss stands still and tastes the good without the fall to ill   whilst all of pain and pleasure share their hour of joy their hour of care adapted to each several state fixed and determinate as fate the world my friend an ample field of such examples store does yield how throbs the infants little breast beneath a load of care oppressed the care that issues with a sigh the tear yet standing in the eye or caught in laughters dimple sleek dried up in stealing down the cheek see next among the sacheld crowd bold as a hero and as proud the little tyrant of his class how happy till condemned to parse or sob beneath the weightier curse of scanning lilys crabbed verse however puerile this example may seem there has been more than one instance of a schoolboys having actually been guilty of suicide in order to avoid the discipline of the rod or the ferula  in youth how glows the vital fire tween expectation and desire our sanguine hopes our awkard fears all suiting unexperienced years still riper joys do manhood bless when fullblown fortune we possess we riot on the joyous store till health and strength can charm no more when disappointment and chagrin retaliate all our joys with spleen proportioned next to wasted age insipid joys and peevish rage though dim the exhausted passions burn take to our latest gasp their turn thus relative my friend we find the pains and pleasures of mankind adapted all in due degree to human sensibility

own pangs engender ease their antidote like scorpions bring to expel the poison of their sting the tension of the extended nerve say phisiologists may serve the means of pleasure and of pain this seeming paradox to explain as strung the harp with trembling wire so braced with nerves the human lyre while such in tune these sages say the smiling hours in concert play but if in change too lax or tense health strikes no more the keys of sense but tremblingly alive all over the tortured strings in discord roar while sickness with her harpy claws stranger to each harmonious cause labors benumbed the jarring strain that stuns our ear with deafning pain nor yet can health too often repeat its music howsoever sweet while by degrees lo every string deprived of its elastick spring in general lassitude full soon the whole machine grows out of tune should also passion sense or art wind up too high the nervous part with noise the notes tumultuous tire or breaking strings unman the lyre of pain or pleasure on our frame the effects hence frequently the same thus full of gladness or of grief in tears we find the same relief alike the feeble nerve destroy exquisite pain extatick joy the bandit stretched upon the wheel the extreme of torture never can feel but cruelty disarming lies or dead to sense or really dies so rapture never meant to bless even joy grows pain when in excess indulged to print the burning kiss on chloes lips how fierce the bliss how keen the torture of her charms caressed to pant within her arms melting in fullness of desire stretched on the rack of bliss texpire thus constitutional below is all our bliss is all our woe each holding intimately joined alternate empire over the mind like persian monarchs hardly known ere tumbled headlong from the throne precarious and as short its sway deposed and sceptred in a day pleasure begins its fickle reign and tyrannizes into pain when as to cruel pain we bow its rod grows light we know not how ah cruel blow to human pride is pain and pleasure thus allied that all the sweets of life grow sour within the transitory hour complains lorenzo darts behind no ray of comfort on his mind if thus with varied joy and strife diversified all states of life if human being cannot know a constant state of bliss or woe worn by sharp misery to the bones while grief with intermission groans and meagre want half fed the while grins forth her grateful ghastly smile though vain our hopes of bliss as vain our fears of unremitting pain absurd the mischiefmaking care that leads us blindly to despair   epistle the sixth  argument on abstract good and evil  the physical perfection of the material universe and the moral harmony observable in the dispensations of providience  summary the inquiries of philosophers into the abstract cause of evil have hitherto been attended with little success indeed no such abstract evil exists for whatever calamities human life be subject to their evil depends merely on our own sensibility even physical evils which are the least controvertible are evidently relative to their effects on the sufferings or enjoyments of mankind whence they must not be accounted abstract evils or real defects in the general system of things of which we have at present but a partial view and therefore cannot tell how far apparent imperfections may conduce to the perfection of the whole that human life is subject nevertheless to palpable evils cannot be denied but it should be considered that as such evils are but temporary and are evil but in proportion to the pleasure or good by which they are contrasted we are not sensible of any abstracted evil unless a state of humanity on the whole be attended with a greater portion of pain than pleasure this is asserted by many but is experimentally false indeed on a fair and impartial estimate our sufferings and enjoyments seem to stand on an equal balance hence also if there be no abstract physical evil in the universe there is as little reason for us to hold the existence of physical good or to maintain that happiness is the privilege of human life that whatever is is right with respect to the whole is allowed but that it is therefore good is another consideration goodness being a term relative to the happiness of mankind and not applicable to that general system the famous principle of the best is therefore futile and frivolous  as to moral good and evil we owe a sense of them purely to physical for had mankind felt neither pain nor pleasure they would never from the light of nature have acquired the ideas of moral good or ill those actions therefore are morally good which give rise to more pleasure than pain and morally bad vice versa innocence being strictly speaking neither good nor evil and indeed inconsistent with a state of action moral evil appears hence to be also merely relative to man and can by no means be considered as a defect in the designs of providence unless we can be so absurd as to suppose it in the power of created beings to counterwork the intentions of their supreme creator on the other hand moral good is equally relative and can have no effect on the happiness of the first cause or plead any abstract merit with the deity moral good and evil however in the agent is necessarily attended with temporary happiness and misery in the distribution of which also agreeable to relative merit it is not improbable that impartial justice is done even in this life in the perfect dispensations of providence our hopes or apprehensions nevertheless of a future state are not hereby cut off on the contrary this life may only be preparatory to a future where the virtuous and vicious may be very differently disposed of in the scale of existence but whatever be our lot hereafter it rests on the good pleasure of our creator into whose hands philosophy calmly resigns the hidden concerns of futurity  epistle the sixth is there who teach that human woe must from a source abstracted flow existing in creations plan some active ill the curse of man some imperfection or offense in physics or in providence the question old unanswered lies whence did the curse of evil rise by wolfius left and twenty more as puzzling as twas left before to god or devil still assigned the cause of ill by humankind in disobedience to his god did man himself call down the rod or

error free these only relative to thee in icy chains let winter bind the glebe untrod by humankind fierce lightenings flash and thunders roll their horrors only round the pole let malstrooms roar and heclas blaze where fools nor cowards stand to gaze let islands drown let mountains melt these are no evils till they are felt mid southern seas and lands unknown should agonizing nature groan there

called from its supposed founder ulysses fall lorenzo of creations plan but parts are visible to man whence ignrant of their separate use we think them subject to abuse though all with art consummate

humanity however lowly in degree how ignorant and weak are those who natures author then suppose in providence remains a spy to guard his work with watchful eye from fallen angels base intent the direful outrage to prevent to rescue or preserve his plan from that prodigious creature man like the young steed that scours the plain its nature wild and needs a rein or halts it like a foundered jade lame by her frequent stumbling made perhaps lorenzo some mistake concerning providence we make the powers of nature to divide from its imaginary guide for if creation has in fact been long ago a finished act what end does laboring time pursue or what has providence in view for sure thou will not take the side of those whose ignorance and pride maintain the universe designed merely to gratify mankind a stage as on a strolers cart where drolls itinrant play their part in grinning mirth or brawling strife the tragicomedy of life was then heavens wondrous power displayed this system in perfection made only to wear itself away stupendous frame for mere decay its worlds to wander through the void destroying till themselves destroyed or in some future fabled days to take imaginary blaze at flames that all to ruin turn annihilating as they burn riskd then the censure of my wit i hold the world unfinished yet time building what heavens wisdom planned creations work even yet in hand through natures scenes in order range see all things in continual change all to some point progressive run to do as well as be undone existing for so short a space thousands we know but by their place which changed by changing form we say the things themselves are passed away no proofs of being objects bring whose essence ever on the wing flown from their forms ere yet defined leaves no identity behind but waving this yet see we here no abstract cause of ill to fear since on the feelings of mankind depends the every ill we find whence though our sufferings ill we call they are no abstracted cause at all for stripped creation of mankind no evil would be left behind to this will cavillers reply we ask not where those causes lie if in externals be the offense or in the pravity of sense that real ill exists is plain while man is sensible of pain in answer my lorenzo here no vaunting stoicism fear nor think thy friend so madly wise taffect his misries to despise i never presume that point to teach nor against the voice of nature preach none feel more tenderly than i mine the soft heart and watery eye the sanguine hopes the groundless fears still unsubdued by sense or years

wretch in torture to persuade of evil not to be afraid the murderer mangled on the wheel to smile at harmless rope and steel or that the blows that loitering kill cannot be physically ill absurd the argument and vain since all we know of ill is pain and yet as neither grieved nor pained of evil man had never complained if relative our bliss and woe reciprocally ebb and flow it is palpable that joy and strife are but the modes of human life which varied with consummate skill proves on the whole nor good nor ill say thou the learned are agreed the ills of life the good exceed lorenzo peevish sick or vain how natural is it to complain but sure experience here denies this threadbare maxim of the wife behold the weak the blind the lame the sons of poverty and shame the wretch expiring by degrees by amputations or disease such whose vile lot the world their foe contempt and beggary below should thou to this or that propose in death a cure for all their woes tell em oppressed with human strife wide stand the numerous doors of life with open arms the wretch to save rest welcomes misery to the grave how few your recipe will try though dying piecemeal loath to dye nor merely from the fear of worse tenacious of a present curse for say annihilation here the all poor mortals have to fear how few would yet their ills incline their sense of being to resign to part on terms like these with pain with pleasure never to meet again even nature shuddring at the thought to sink inconscious into naught in mere existence sure mankind must then intrinsic pleasure find some good equivalent must feel to such supposed excess of ill since thus by death so loath to part an aching head and bleeding heart may not at least all human woe be balanced with our joys below do thou lorenzo doubt of this how do thou measure earthly bliss it is not by ecstasy alone thy actual share of joy is known duration adds to the degree as much as its intensity joy for a moments space how small pain instantaneous none at all through life continued little less even bare content than happiness the joyous ecstasy of bliss dilating rarefied to this be it on individuals tried each needs but to be satisfied the longing wish the sigh is over when once content we ask no more thus equal joy we often taste in shortlived pleasures snatched in haste as others or when raptured less for years even we ourselves possess hence often asserted in dispute that time ideas constitute sense of duration so confined to that which passes in the mind thexpectant lover thinks in rage his stellias absent hour an age while short and sweet the moments fly when love and she sit smiling by nor given their epithets in vain to fleeting joy and lingering pain in minutes flown each joyful day each sad one whiled in hours away nay though of life tenacious all longevity no bliss we call in different animals at least while even the less the greaters feast it is probable their joys and strife are suited to their term of life whence equal pleasure equal pain may longlived elephants sustain with young ephemerons whose flight at noon beginning ends at night during which momentary space they rise love battle and embrace fluttering around till out of breath they drop into the arms of death from selfexperience do thou rate the real hardship of thy fate art thou with every friend at strife see thou no gentle joy in life do thou no favorite scheme possess to build contemplative success have thou no hope no good do choose a good thou would not die to lose thy day thus clouded at the dawn will brighter shine its clouds withdrawn or is thy morn of sunshine past with clouds thy evnings overcast would of its brightness know thamount bring morn and evening to account stands nature then so long abused of abstract evil thus excused as little truth is understood by those who hold all nature good whatever is is right  it may but therefore good we cannot say unless some perfect bliss we see arise from partial misery in spite of truth in reasons spite when vexed or pained we all denyt never till the pain be over confessing that was which never is a blessing the terms then here misunderstood rights not equivocal to good goodness adapted and confined to the appetites of humankind the right unknown to you or me though sure what is is fit to be let plato then or leibnitz prate of goodness influencing fate or idle sophisters contest their boasted principle the best by disputants on either side the partial term is misapplied but should we even suppose the term to be used with propriety in this case it remains to be proved that two different systems cannot be equally good before we subscribe to the doctrine of leibnitz or plato viz that out of an infinite variety of possible worlds god has chosen or could not but choose the best  that god is good they know full well but what his goodness none can tell unless to man his kindness shown heavens good depends upon our own lorenzo merely to mankind thus evil physical confined of moral next a puzzling task an explanation do thou ask say thou heavens care no more extends to physical than moral ends the same the providential power that rains the soft refreshing shower that in the womb of teeming earth its atoms quickens into birth does in the moral scene connect the cause and consequent effect on virtue peace of heart bestows softens the good mans casual woes abandons vice to fell despair or plagues with heartcorroding care concluding hence that moral ill opposing natures righteous will aloud for heavens dread vengeance calls the curse that on the guilty falls so far lorenzo i with thee in part most readily agree that vice will leave a sting behind and virtue its reward shall find yet all with good st paul confess without a law we cannot transgress now natures law is heavens command whose will no mortal can withstand how lives earths animated clod to contravene the will of god as well adventurous of his neck the laws of gravity to break presumptuous man might seek to fly a creeping earthworm to the sky or don the bishops winged shoon to trip it yarely to the moon bishop wilkins conceived a possibility of our flying up to the moon and that it would in time become as common for a traveller to call for his wings as it was for his cotemporaries to call for their boots  what curse soever then vice provoke creations laws can never be broke but know by physical alone is moral good or evil known for had not vice the power to vex its evil never would perplex each moral thus a partial ill permitted by the eternal will to mortals relative the offense and punishments of providence lorenzo state the matter clear be pain and pleasure strangers here strangers to pleasure and to pain induce what motives to complain suppose we then in natures plan texist thautomaton of man rising from senseless matters arms where perfect rest nor grieves nor charms should heaven a consciousness bestow subject to good or ill below not real pain or pleasure give but only make the form to live as yet from all reflection clear unnervd by hope unawed by fear suppose to action thus consigned this naked unaffected mind lorenzo with precision hence let us infer the consequence ere yet existed moral ill the first sole agent was the will reason without the power to act to censure or advise a fact as from experience naught it knew of good or bad or false or true for reason its conclusion draws from similar effect and cause no instinct faculty or sense insuring actual innocence that bids us virtues steps pursue or points to bliss it never knew else giving reason here had heaven no less than actual pleasure given this not supposed  hence reasons use some known effect must introduce now as innate if we maintain a love of bliss and hate of pain directed as the passions fired the will to pleasure first aspired the moral agent bound to choose from pleasures most immediate views but prone to censure and complain suppose our first sensation pain let pain or pleasure be attained of both an equal sense was gained as the first tree of knowledge bore of good and evil equal store for when the mind one pleasure knew its neutral state of rest withdrew pleasure and pain by contrast known criteria of each other grown hence felt thinitiated mind the sting which pleasure left behind and reason did to act commence on thinformation of the sense seeing the passions ebb and flow now swollen with bliss now sunk in woe traced out the bounds extremes between of innocence that golden mean but ah the fluctuating tide of passion does this mean deride consistent only it is confessed with nature in a state of rest here then from moral action came the necessary ill we blame running selflove in full career reason her guide not always near her satisfaction often pursuing though at her own and others ruin pronounce we hence a moral ill thindulgence of the human will whenever from such indulgence flows more pain than pleasure it bestows in guilt original involved here see the wondrous mystery solved to the first man no more confined than passions found in every mind is the plain cause of moral woe sin human frailty here below lorenzo evil understood the dies reverse is moral good whatever more pleasure yields than pain not indeed solely to the agent but to mankind or the moral world in general  the name of goodness does obtain unsatisfied lorenzo yet do thou lost happiness regret does from our plan of morals seem yet providence no perfect scheme because perplexed with fear or pain even virtue covets bliss in vain do thou against the cause object it is disproportioned to the effect thus in thintemprance of the will to place the source of moral ill our passions but a natural cause obedient to creations laws here palpably too innocent the cause of misery to be meant must i repeat it over again from pleasure flows our sense of pain through life each others contrast made dependant these as light and shade whence though to moderation joined contents serenity of mind while vice but sports with higher glee to sink as low in misery proportioned to the guilty joy the pangs intemperance annoy yet on the whole no abstract ill does here confront the eternal will of evil all theffected strife but relative to human life say thou indeed if man confined to fill the place by heaven assigned but partially to rise or fall why feels he misery at all another question answers this what title have mankind to bliss during thy life if man and boy thy share of both thou may enjoy if perfect rest the certain mean our pleasures and our pains between nulled the momentum of our pain who shall of providence complain see thou incumbering the ground the barren fig trees flourish round while virtue

vice impunity since it is so plain the sting of woe to joy inordinate does grow and none from virtues paths would stray if pleasure did not lead the way can virtue also hence despair since virtues providences care compensing pleasure due to pain and this nor that bestowed in vain let fools when hard their present lot think distant heaven has earth forgot in discontent aloud complain that all our trust in heaven is vain pretending god the world protects and yet its several parts neglects do thou lorenzo better taught never indulge so wild a thought conceiving the individual man no charge

i kiss the chastning rod and bless the father in the god   epistle the seventh  argument on moral principles  the respective influence of reason and the passions  the immorality of ignorance and the indispensable duty of seeking knowledge  summary the doctrine by which virtue and vice are confessedly limited to this life will doubtless excite the clamor of those who pride themselves or ground their expectations of future happiness on their own merit it may also be asked to what purpose is it that mankind should pursue virtue rather than vice if all our pains and pleasures depend reciprocally on each other and our bad deeds neither actually offend nor our good ones have any real merit with the deity it is answered that as the merits and demerits of virtue and vice are partial and relative so also must be conceived their respective rewards and punishments so that whatever distinction may be made between the virtuous and vicious in a future state it must be purely owing to the good pleasure of our creator and not to the influence of our merit over his final determinations  it must not be conceived however that this doctrine countenances immorality on the contrary it proves that as we are led to vice solely by the motives of pleasure apparently attending the gratification of our desires were a conviction always present to the mind that such pleasure must necessarily be attended with an equal degree of pain such conviction might prove an antidote to vice and preserve us at least in innocence the motive to action being thereby removed as to actual virtue indecd it is not pretended that any rational conviction whatever is of itsef a sufficient motive to virtue the use of reason being only to determine what is true or false just or unjust and not to excite us to embrace either this is the business of the passions which are however in themselves neither good nor evil those dispositions of mind which are generally termed virtuous being the frequent occasion of our falling into vices which opposite ones though generally disapproved or detested would have secured us from thus compassion benevolence and candor are the fertile sources of vice while hardnessofheart selfishness and distrust are as frequently the means of preserving innocence nay the fierce hardened and turbulent passions enter sometimes into the most virtuous characters and a heart unaffccted by the present sufferings of humanity is not unfrequently necessary to preserve the rights and liberties of mankind  in fact we are much deceived in the motives as well as in the practice of virtue it being not only necessary that we should mean to do good and take the best way our reason may direct us to effect it but that we should previously take those measures which are in our power to acquire the knowledge of the means of doing such good wilful ignorance is declared therefore intentionally vicious not having though innocent in fact the least claim to merit to which even virtue itself has but relative pretensions indeed as physical good in the consequence is the measure of moral good in the action the very appearance of merit in the agent in a great degree vanistes our power of doing good depending frequently on accident and not very seldom on downright knavery on all which considerations knowledge is laid dow as a fundamental and indispensible moral principle and hence the employment of our leisure hours in inquiries after tru is presumed to be not merely entertaining but morally virtuous  epistle the seventh hark my lorenzo how they rage the

the points agreed from macedonias madman to the swede the whole strange purpose of their lives to find or make an enemy of all mankind i will grant that many heroic actions have been achieved which have given just room for those who have no tincture of heroism in themselves to suppose the hero to be without either head or heart but however reprehensible the conduct of heroes may have been in general history may inform us that many of the distinguishing blessings mankind enjoy have been effected by those whom narrowminded moralists have stigmatized as rogues and madmen  how needful half

pious pill of charity like wards does kill while lightened more the pedlars pack to clothe our own than save his back whence then is virtue do thou cry in truth and nature i reply reason and passion

experience here to use that passion reason may not abuse cautious in virtues route to go no farther than such route we know lest when through ignorance lost our way passion to vice should wildly stray it is not enough to mean aright unless that meant effects in sight too apt to wander from the mark when blundring forward in the dark a poor excuse to have it said the heart had put it in the head

both on our motives and our ends what merit is it we gladly do that which our hearts incline us to or what that reason does submit to own the truth is right and fit for say that by the heart or head

arguments for and against a future state  summary the immortality of the soul or doctrine of a future state is proposed as the subject of inquiry a doctrine which however true or false in itself is both weakly attacked and lamely supported by the philosophical arguments generally made use of for or against it comparisons drawn from the vegetable creation however striking are partial and prove nothing moral arguments prove as little unless we could first be made certain that vice and virtue are not duly punished and rewarded in this life or unless we could entertain adequate ideas of divine justice with these the metaphysical refinements concerning the souls immateriality are shown to be equally inconclusive our natural desire of existence is exposed also as a weak argument for the justice of our claim to immortality on the other hand that intimate connection between body and mind and their apparent dependence on each other are shown to afford rather a specious plea in favor of the immortality of the soul than as frequently made to do any argument against it  setting however moral and metaphysical speculations aside man is considered merely in the light of an animal in which state of humiliation his pretensions to a future state are notwithstanding evidently justified on the plain and reasonable supposition that the creator has given to all animals such powers and faculties as were necessary to the state of being appointed them  now the evident pursuits of other animals tend solely to the gratification of themselves or the mere preservation of their kind they have no intellectual system that extends beyond the life of the individual nor does their experience serve to the improvement of their species with man it is otherwise the preservation and gratification of the individual however powerful their motives are in him made subservient to more general views his case health and life being constantly sacrificed to pursuits that are of no use to him merely as an animal but on the contrary serve to promote the intellectual perfection of his species hence apparently intended for the enjoyment of a state of existence to which those faculties are adapted in the powers of imagination and genius may also be traced that faint image of the deity in which man was confessedly made so that philosophy alone affords us sufficient reason to believe the certainty of a future state without our having recourse to contested authorities the chimerical suppositions of error or the absurdities of ignorance  epistle the eighth o blind to truth to science blind the sceptick tribe of humankind who doubt lorenzo if our lot be here to die and be forgot or if it prove our future fate to know an intellectual state in death to perish or to rise immortal to our native skies by our being immortal is only meant that the soul does not perish with the body we being strangers to any philosophical proof of its abstract or essential immortality  allured by wit to neither side be reason our impartial guide let us lorenzo fairly weigh what argument has here to say have thou poor dromios sophisms got who bids us vegetate and rot man but a rank and useless weed prove them alike and it is agreed but the analogy of parts is all that is proved by skeptic arts say that of vegetable race we spread the root from place to place the lovely flower of beauty blows twin sister to the province rose allures at morn the gazing eye that ere the evening sees it die say years disrobe the mantled brow as winter strips the autumnal bough the rough rude blast to both unkind both perish by an eastern wind or by the axe untimely blow are laid their spreading honors low admit lorenzo this be true go on  the parallel pursue say the tall elms you stately row sweet transports of sensation know when zephyrs kiss the lillys breast the lillys rapture be confessed say the broad oak when thunders roar fears till the thunderstorm be over conscious of doubt and dread by turns stands trembling as the forest burns alive awake to natures laws from natures scenes experience draws throbbing its trunk with hopes and fears grown old in wisdom as in years is this absurd absurd indeed lorenzo how unlike a weed to moral arguments do run here shall we end as we begun say thou the virtuous when they die in their own right ascend the sky the wicked here unpunished go to torment in the world below heavens justice else we should arraign and prove the virtuous good in vain you take my friend for granted here what none by reason make appear that vice at god almightys hands eternal punishment demands while endless bliss beyond the skies justice bestows as virtues prize justice lorenzo what my friend by justice do thou here intend her sword she holds but say what ails the equilibrium of her scales how low the one though empty lies to kick the beam while the other flies alas i see by what compelled in different mediums are they held one in material fluids buoyed the other in a perfect void weighed in eternity and time the punishment against the crime dare the selfrighteous tribe to say that heavens no more than virtues pay while vice demerits endless woe needs god a friend fears god a foe holding vindictive rage in store for his own sake on man to pour o no  unhurt the almighty cause or kept or broken human laws cease then presumption to contend that mortals heaven itself offend or at an infinite expense must answer a finite offense to pay the fine immortal made which else unable to have paid the dying wretch though tyrants cure but tortures longer to endure with nature cruelty at strife when criminals are quit with life can god whose tender mercies flow over all his varied works below whose loving kindness all confess whose name the distant nations bless say can this god of boundless love vengeful as earthly tyrants prove o shame lorenzo shame to all such cruelty that justice call such argument beside is vain unless the premises were plain unless we first could make it clear that vice can never be punished here that virtue must be ever blessed for follwing but its interest or that we truly could define that justice mortals call divine by metaphysics do thou strive to keep the man in death alive would thou set moral pleas aside the body from the soul divide material that and born to die while this a native of the sky objects that none can hear and see hence claiming immortality but say is thy corporeal claim laid to the matter or the frame is it the substance of the heart or make that is the mortal part does change of form bring death alone form we must immaterial own if to the essence of the clay again mortality we lay doomed the loathed carcass to the worm the substance changes but its form through modes of being given to range immortal in perpetual change maiter by all the skeptic crowd essentially the same allowed in death in life our shame our pride in various forms but modified say then the matter or the frame or both in body have a claim nor mortal nor immortal we from our materiality this argument might be carried much farther and the mere potential existence of matter proved to a demonstration but this would be perhaps too abstruse to enter into poetical composition  lorenzo does thy bosom beat to claim in heaven the immortal seat so fond of thy existence here do thou annihilation fear to fall as undistinguished clay to dumb forgetfulness a prey the joys of paradise in view say thou thy claim must needs be true else wherefore does thy fond desire to immortality aspire see the famous soliloquy in addisons cato which may pass for logic on the stage and is perhaps goodenough theatrical reasoning but will hardly satisfy a philosopher in his closet unless indeed such a one as prefers the declamation of a plato to the demonstrations of a newton  whatever in hope be heavens intent this is my friend no argument i too perhaps so pleased to live my very means of life might give all i am worth from death to save if hope were buried in the grave but let lorenzo never trust to wish or hope however just nor let a passionate desire to reasons sober task aspire would thou false principles defend because they serve a pleasing end who loves the truth will sure despise her cause to rest on specious lies what merit does it add to worth that knaves its virtues babble forth what added weight or consequence in suffrage gives the fool to sense again is it said so closely joined in life the body and the mind reciprocally formed to bear each others weight of pain and care sharing alike the mutual joy which either wholly may destroy since thus together both concur we know not either to prefer if both be purposely combined in use of body or of mind are there who weakly hence suppose the soul no separate being knows but as the body does decay so wears the mortal mind away yet wherefore might not at our birth lodged in this tenement of earth locked up for life the immortal mind its temporary prison find till paid our vital debt should be and death should set the captive free meanwhile in hope in fear in doubt concerning friends and foes without prone through its prison grates to pry it sees times scattered ruins lie in darkness and confusion hurled the embryo of another world why may not thus on earth be joined the body and the tenant mind thinhabitant with cost and care keeping his mansion in repair used to the dungeon where he lies and prone his present home to prize unknowing whither doomed to roam if once bereft of house and home what wonder then for help he calls when danger threats his tottering walls nor strange if heedless of their fate they tumble on his wareless pate each others mutual strength and ward the mansion and the mansions lord what though we hold the soul to be attached to sensibility concludes lorenzo rashly hence the souls as mortal as the sense alleging that in life we find perception to the organs joined poor mortals of sensation void as these are damaged or destroyed therefore the soul on sense depends and with the failing organ ends lorenzo through a darkened glass see thou but faintly objects pass more darkened yet do thou confess thy certainty of vision less with its transparency thy sight decreasing till obstructed quite suppose it broke or let it fall do think thou could not see at all ridiculous when objects lie all open to the naked eye thus may the soul to body joined be deaf irrational or blind but take thobstructing organs hence at liberty its native sense by fits no more it hears and sees as now by piecemeal and degrees in partial modes adapted here to organs of the eye and ear but intellect all ear all eye it reads the wonders of the sky at once what nature can disclose of scientifick secrets knows now sense and science both combined in each perception of the mind but here lorenzo for a while lay by the metaphysick foil with this behind our darkened glass too apt to make a blundring pass by much more anxious on the whole to guard the body than the soul too nice the anatomizing art to take them dexterously apart let us on both inquiry plan and scrutinize their compound man contented from his present state to reason of his future fate does dromio say to hold dispute man if no plant is yet a brute a helpless animal in birth his body formed of

secures from want the careful and laborious ant while man with all his boasted sense riots at healths and lifes expense luxurious casts his cares aside or starves through indolence or pride here no

is commonly taken in so many senses that its signification remains very loose and indeterminate the ingenious rousseau of geneva after having declaimed heartily against la bonne chere or in plain english displayed the terrible consequences of eating beef and pudding cries out voila les funestes garands que la plupart de nos maux sont notre propre ouvrage et que nous les aurions presque tous

etat contre nature et que lhomme qui medite est un animal deprave what use is here made of the word nature but i would ask if mankind ever were in this state of solitude how came it about they are united in a social one  were they led to it by inclination or necessity if by inclination nature evidently prescribed it if by the necessities peculiar to their species a state of society was not only prescribed but enforced by nature indeed whoever before doubted of mans being by nature a social animal  twas nature when the world was young unloosd our first great grandsires tongue taught his wild sons the force of speech and gave the human power to teach to social converse tuned the ear gave mutual love and mutual fear inspired the hero warmed the friend and bade the strong the weak defend

striving to prove by various means that brutes are nothing but machines there are indeed also some pretended philosophers whose heads so full of impenetrable matter have been employed to prove man a
