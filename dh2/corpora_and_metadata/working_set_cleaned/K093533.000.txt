pauls churchyard and t slack in newcastle  mdcclxvi  a card from the author to david garrick esquire remoteness of situation and some other circumstances have hitherto deprived the author of that happiness he might receive from seeing mr garrick  it is the universal regard his character commands occasions this address  it may be thought by many at a visit so abrupt as this is that something highly complimentary should be said on the part of the intruder but according to the ideas the author has conceived of mr garricks delicacy and good sense a single period in the garb of flattery would certainly offend him  he therefore takes his leave  and after having stepped perhaps a little too forward to offer his tribute of esteem respectfully retires  newcastle feb      the subscribers names

the law directs  day a pastoral  carpe diem hor morning i in the barn the tenant cock close to partlet perched on high briskly crows the shepherds clock jocund that the mornings nigh ii swiftly from the mountains brow shadows nursed by night retire and the peeping sunbeam now paints with gold the village spire iii philomel forsakes the thorn plaintive where she prates at night and the lark to meet the morn soars beyond the shepherds sight iv from the lowroofd cottage ridge see the chattring swallow spring darting through the onearchd bridge quick she dips her dappled wing v now the pinetrees waving top gently greets the morning gale kidlings now begin to crop daisies on the dewey dale vi from the balmy sweets uncloyd restless till her task be done now the busy bees employed sipping dew before the sun vii trickling through the crevicd rock where the limpid stream distills sweet refreshment waits the flock when it is sundrove from the hills viii colins for the promised corn ere the harvest hopes are ripe anxious  whilst the huntsmans horn boldly sounding drowns his pipe ix sweet  o sweet the warbling throng on the white emblossomd spray natures universal song echos to the rising day noon x fervid on the glittering flood now the noontide radiance glows drooping over its infant bud not a dewdrops left the rose xi by the brook the shepherd dines from the fierce meridian heat sheltered by the branching pines pendant over his grassy seat xii now the flock forsakes the glade where uncheckd the sunbeams fall sure to find a pleasing shade by the ivyd abbey wall xiii echo in her airy round over the river rock and hill cannot catch a single sound save the clack of yonder mill xiv cattle court the zephirs bland where the streamlet wanders cool or with languid silence stand midway in the marshy pool xv but from mountain dell or stream not a fluttering zephir springs fearful lest the noontide beam scorch its soft its silken wings xvi not a leaf has leave to stir natures lulled  serene  and still quiet even the shepherds cur sleeping on the heathclad hill xvii languid is the landscape round till the fresh descending shower grateful to the thirsty ground raises every fainting flower xviii now the hill  the hedge  is green now the warblers throats in tune blithsome is the verdant scene brightened by the beams of noon evening xix over the heath the heifer strays free  the furrowed task is done now the village windows blaze burnished by the setting sun xx now he sets behind the hill sinking from a golden sky can the pencils mimic skill copy the refulgent dye xxi trudging as the plowmen go to the smoking hamlet bound giantlike their shadows grow lengthened over the level ground xxii where the rising forest spreads shelter for the lordly dome to their highbuilt airy beds see the rooks returning home xxiii as the lark with varied tune carrols to the evening loud mark the mild resplendent moon breaking through a parted cloud xxiv now the hermit howlet peeps from the barn or twisted brake and the blue mist slowly creeps curling on the silver lake xxv as the trout in speckled pride playful from its bosom springs to the banks a ruffled tide verges in successive rings xxvi tripping through the silken grass over the pathdivided dale mark the rosecomplexiond lass with her wellpoisd milking pail xxvii linnets with unnumberd notes and the cuckoo bird with two tuning sweet their mellow throats bid the setting sun adieu the contemplatist a night piece nox erat  cum tacet omnis ager pecudes pictaeque volucres  i the nurse of contemplation night begins her balmy reign advancing in their varied light her silvervested train ii it is strange the many marshalled stars that ride yon sacred round should keep among their rapid cars a silence so profound iii a kind a philosophic calm the cool creation wears and what day drank of dewy balm the gentle night repairs iv behind their leafy curtains hid the feathered race how still how quiet now the gamesome kid that gambold round the hill v the sweets that bending over their banks from sultry day declined revive in little velvet ranks and scent the western wind vi the moon preceded by the breeze that bade the clouds retire appears amongst the tufted trees a phoenix nest on fire vii but soft  the golden glow subsides her chariot mounts on high and now in silent pomp she rides pale regent of the sky viii where time upon the withered tree has carved the moral chair i sit from busy passions free and breathe the placid air ix the withered tree was once in prime its branches braved the sky thus at the touch of ruthless time shall youth and vigor die x i am lifted to the blue expanse it glows serenely gay come science by my side advance well search the milky way xi let us descend  the daring flight fatigues my feeble mind and science in the maze of light is impotent and blind xii what are those wild those wandering fires that over the moorland ran vapors how like the vague desires that cheat the heart of man xiii but there is a friendly guide  a flame that lambent over its bed enlivens with a gladsome beam the hermits osier shed xiv amongst the russet shades of night it glances from afar and darts along the dusk so bright it seems a silver star xv in coverts where the few frequent if virtue deigns to dwell it is thus the little lamp content gives luster to her cell xvi how smooth that rapid river slides progressive to the deep the poppies pendent over its sides have charmed the waves to sleep xvii pleasures intoxicated sons ye indolent ye gay reflect  for as the river runs life wings its tractless way xviii that branching grove of dusky green conceals the azure sky save where a starry space between relieves the darkened eye xix old error thus with shades impure throws sacred truth behind yet sometimes through the deep obscure she bursts upon the mind xx sleep and her sister silence reign they lock the shepherds fold but hark  i hear a lamb complain it is lost upon the would xxi to savage herds that hunt for prey an unresisting prize for having trod a devious way the little rambler dies xxii as luckless is the virgins lot whom pleasure once misguides when hurried from the halcion cot where innocence presides  xxiii the passions a relentless train to tear the victim run she seeks the paths of peace in vain is conquered  and undone xxiv how bright the little insects blaze where willows shade the way as proud as if their painted rays could emulate the day xxv it is thus the pygmy sons of power advance their vain parade thus glitter in the darkened hour and like the glowworms fade xxvi the soft serenity of night ungentle clouds deform the silver host that shone so bright is hid behind a storm xxvii the angry elements engage an oak an ivied bower repels the rough winds noisy rage and shields me from the shower xxviii the rancour thus of rushing fate i have learnt to render vain for whilst integritys her seat the soul will sit serene xxix a raven from some greedy vault amidst that cloistered gloom bids me and it is a solemn thought reflect upon the tomb xxx the tomb  the consecrated dome the temple raised to peace the port that to its friendly home compels the human race xxxi yon village to the moral mind a solemn aspect wears where sleep has lulled the labored hind and killed his daily cares xxxii it is but the churchyard of the night an emblematic bed that offers to the mental sight the temporary dead xxxiii from hence i will penetrate in thought the graves unmeasured deep and tutored hence be timely taught to meet my final sleep xxxiv it is peace  the little chaos past the gentle moons restored a breeze succeeds the frightful blast that through the forest roared xxxv the nightingale a welcome guest renews her gentle strains and hope just wandering from my breast her wonted seat regains xxxvi yes  when yon lucid orb is dark and darting from on high my soul a more celestial spark shall keep her native sky xxxvii fanned by the light  the lenient breeze my limbs refreshment find and moral rhapsodies like these give vigor to the mind content a pastoral i over moorlands and mountains rude barren and bare as wilderd and wearied i roam a gentle young shepherdess sees my despair and leads me  over lawns  to her home yellow sheafs from rich ceres her cottage had crowned green rushes were strewn on her floor her casement sweet woodbines crept wantonly round and decked the sod seats at her door ii we sat ourselves down to a cooling repast fresh fruits and she culled me the best while thrown from my guard by some glances she cast love slily stole into my breast i told my soft wishes she sweetly replied ye virgins her voice was divine i have rich ones rejected and great ones denied but take me fond shepherd  i am thine iii her air was so modest her aspect so meek so simple yet sweet were her charms i kissed the ripe roses that glowed on her cheek and locked the loved maid in my arms now jocund together we tend a few sheep and if by yon prattler the stream reclined on her bosom i sink into sleep her image still softens my dream iv together we range over the slow rising hills delighted with pastoral views or rest on the rock whence the streamlet distills and point out new themes for my muse to pomp or proud titles she never did aspire the damsels of humble descent the cottager peace is well known for her sire and shepherds have named her content with a present i let not the hand of amity be nice nor the poor tribute from the heart disclaim a trifle shall become a pledge of price if friendship stamps it with her sacred name ii the little rose that laughs upon its stem one of the sweets with which the gardens teem in value soars above an eastern gem if tendered as the token of esteem iii had i vast hoards of massy wealth to send such as your merits might demand  their due then should the golden tribute of your friend rival the treasures of the rich peru corydon a pastoral to the memory of william shenstone esquire i come shepherds well follow the hearse well see our loved corydon laid though sorrow may blemish the verse yet let a sad tribute be paid they called him the pride of the plain in sooth he was gentle and kind he marked on his elegant strain the graces that glowed in his mind ii on purpose he planted yon trees that birds in the covert might dwell he cultured his thyme for the bees but never would rifle their cell ye lambkins that played at his feet go bleat  and your master bemoan his music was artless and sweet his manners as mild as your own iii no verdure shall cover the vale no bloom on the blossoms appear the sweets of the forest shall fail and winter discolor the year no birds in our hedges shall sing our hedges so vocal before since he that should welcome the spring can greet the gay season no more iv his phillis was fond of his praise and poets came round in a throng they listened  they envied his lays but which of them equaled his song ye shepherds hence forward be mute for lost is the pastoral strain so give me my corydons flute and thus  let me break it in twain the rose and butterfly a fable at days early dawn a gay butterfly spied a budding young rose and he wished her his bride she blushed when she heard him his passion declare and tenderly told him  he need not despair their faith was soon plighted as lovers will do he swore to be constant she vowed to be true it had not been prudent to deal with delay the bloom of a rose passes quickly away and the pride of a butterfly dies in a day when wedded away the winged gentleman hies from flowret to flowret he wantonly flies nor did he revisit his bride till the sun had less than onefourth of his journey to run the rose thus reproached him  already so cold how feigned o you false one that passion you told tis an age since you left me she meant a few hours but such well suppose the fond language of flowers i saw when you gave the base vilet a kiss how  how could you stoop to a meanness like this shall a low little wretch whom we roses despise find favor o love in my butterflys eyes on a tulip quite tawdry i saw your fond rape nor yet could the pitiful primrose escape dull daffodils too were with ardour addressed and poppies illscented you kindly caressed the coxcomb was piqud and replied with a sneer that youre first to complain i commend you my dear but know from your conduct my maxims i drew and if i am inconstant i copy from you i saw the boy zephirus rifle your charms i saw how you simperd and smiled in his arms the honeybee kissed you you cannot disown you favored besides  o dishonor  a drone yet worse  it is a crime that you must not deny your sweets were made common false rose to a fly moral this law long ago did loves providence make that every coquet should be cursed with a rake damon and phebe i when the sweet rosey morning first peeped from the skies a loud singing lark bade the villagers rise the cowslips were lively  the primroses gay and shed their best perfumes to welcome the may the swains and their sweethearts all ranged on the green did homage to phebe  and haild her their queen ii young damon stepped forward he sung in her praise and phebe bestowed him a garland of bays may this wreath said the fair one dear lord of my rows a crown for true merit bloom long on thy brows the swains and their sweethearts that danced on the green approved the fond present of phebe their queen iii amongst lords and fine ladies we shepherds are told the dearest affections are bartered for gold that discord in wedlock is often their lot while cupid and hymen shake hands in a cot at the church with fair phebe since damon has been he is rich as a monarch  she is blessed as a queen a pastoral hymn to janus on the birth of the queen te primum pia thura rogent  te vota salutent  te colat omnis honas mart ad janum i to janus gentle shepherds raise a shrine his honors be divine and as to mighty pan with homage bow to him the virgin troop shall tribute bring let him be hailed like the greenliveried spring spite of the wintry storms that stain his brow ii the pride the glowing pageantry of may glides wantonly away but january in his rough spun vest boasts the full blessings that can never fade he that gave birth to the illustrious maid whose beauties make the british monarch blessed iii could the soft spring with all her sunny showers the frolic nurse of flowers or flaunting summer flushed in ripened pride could they produce a finished sweet so rare or from his golden stores a gift so fair say has the fertile autumn ever supplied iv hence forward let the hoary month be gay as the whitehawthornd may the laughing goddess of the spring disowned her rosy wreath shall on his brows appear old janus as he leads shall fill the year and the less fruitful autumn be dethroned v above the other months supremely blessed glad janus stands confessed he can behold with retrospective face the mighty blessings of the year gone by where to connect a monarchs nuptial tie assembled every glory every grace vi when he looks forward on the flattering year the golden hours appear as in the sacred reign of saturn fair britain shall prove from this propitious date her honors perfect victories complete and boast the brightest hopes a british heir the above little poem was wrote on supposition that her majestys birthday was really in the month of january  stanzas on the forwardness of spring  tibi flores plenis ecce ferunt nymphae calathis vir i over natures fresh bosom by verdure unbound bleak winter blooms lovely as spring rich flowerets how fragrant rise wantonly round and summers winged choristers sing ii to greet the young monarch of britains blessed isle the groves with gay blossoms are graced the primrose peeps forth with an innocent smile and cowslips crowd forward in haste iii dispatch gentle flora the nymphs of your train through woodlands to gather each sweet go  rob of young roses the dewspangld plain and strew the gay spoils at his feet iv two chaplets of laurel in verdure the same for george oh ye virgins entwine from conquests own temples these evergreens came and those from the brows of the nine v what honors ye britons one emblem implies what glory to george shall belong what miltons the other what addisons rise to make him immortal in song vi to a wreath of fresh oak englands emblem of power whose honors with time shall increase add a fair olive sprig just unfolding its flower rich token of concord and peace vii next give him young myrtles by beauties bright queen collected  the pride of the grove how fragrant their odor their foliage how green sweet promise of conjugal love viii let gauls captive lillies cropped close to the ground as trophies of conquest be tied the virgins all cry there is not one to be found outbloomd by his roses  they died ix ye foes of old england such fate shall ye share with george as our glories advance  through envy you will sicken  you will droop  you will despair and die  like the lillies of france as the foregoing stanzas have appeared anonymous in some periodical papers it is thought necessary to observe that they were originally inserted with the authors name in an edinburgh magazine       on the approach of may i the virgin when softened by may attends to the villagers vows the birds sweetly bill on the spray and poplars embrace with their boughs on ida bright venus may reign adored for her beauty above we shepherds that dwell on the plain hail may as the mother of love ii from the west as it wantonly blows ond zephir caresses the vine  be steals a kiss from the rose d willows and woodbines entwine  pinks by the rivulet side t border the vernal alcove ownward to kiss the soft tide  may is the mother of love iii may tinges the butterflys wing he flutters in bridal array and if the winged foresters sing their music is taught them by may the stockdove recluse with her mate conceals her fond bliss in the grove and murmuring seems to repeat that may is the mother of love iv the goddess will visit ye soon ye virgins be sportive and gay get your pipes oh ye shepherds in tune for music must welcome the may would damon have phillis prove kind and all his keen anguish remove let him tell her soft tales and he will find that may is the mother of love phillis a pastoral ballad i i said  on the banks by the stream i have pipd for the shepherds too long oh grant me ye muses a theme where glory may brighten my song but pan bade me stick to my strain nor lessons too lofty rehearse ambition befits not a swain and phillis loves pastoral verse ii the rose though a beautiful red looks faded to philliss bloom and the breeze from the beanflowr bed to her breaths but a feeble perfume the dewdrop so limpid and gay that loose on the violet lies though brightened by phebuss ray wants luster compared to her eyes iii a lilly i plucked in full pride its freshness with here is to compare and foolishly thought till i tried the flowret was equally fair how corydon could you mistake your fault be with sorrow confessed you said the white swans on the lake for softness might rival her breast iv while thus i went on in her praise my phillis passed sportive along ye poets i covet no bays she smiled  a reward for my song i find the god pans in the right no fames like the fair ones applause and cupid must crown with delight the shepherd that sings in his cause the violet i sheltered from the blight ambition fatal to the pride of rank see me in my low condition laughing on the tufted bank ii on my robes for emulation no varietys impressed suited to an humble station mine is an unembroiderd vest iii modest though the maids declare me may in her fantastic train when pastora deigns to wear me hant a flowret half so vain the narcissus i as pendent over the limpid stream i bowed my snowey pride and languishd in a fruitless flame for what the fates denied the fair pastora chanced to pass with such an angel air i saw her in the watery glass and loved the rival fair ii ye fates no longer let me pine a selfadmiring sweet permit me by your grace divine to kiss the fair ones feet that if by chance the gentle maid my fragrance should admire i may  upon her bosom laid in sister sweets expire pomona a pastoral i from orchards of ample extent pomonas compelled to depart and thus as in anguish she went the goddess unburthend her heart ii to flourish where liberty reigns was all my fond wishes required and here i agreed with the swains to live till their freedom expired iii of late you have numbered my trees and threatened to limit my store alas  from such maxims as these i fear  that your freedoms no more iv my flight will be fatal to may for how can her gardens be fine the blossoms are doomed to decay the blossoms i mean that were mine v rich autumn remembers me well my fruitage was fair to behold my pears  how i ripened their swell my pippins  were pippins of gold vi let ceres drudge on with her ploughs she droops as she furrows the soil a nectar i shake from my boughs a nectar that softens my toil vii when bacchus began to repine with patience i bore his abuse he said that i plundered the vine he said that i pilferd his juice viii i know the proud drunkard denies that trees of my culture should grow but let not the traitor advise he comes from the climes of your foe ix alas in your silence i read the sentence i am doomed to deplore it is plain the great pan has decreed my orchard shall flourish no more x the goddess flew off in despair as all her sweet honors declined and plenty and pleasure declare they will loiter no longer behind fancy a song in a pantomime entertainment i fancy leads the fettered senses captives to her fond control merit may have rich pretenses but it is fancy fires the soul ii far beyond the bounds of meaning fancy flies a fairy queen fancy wit and worth disdaining gives the prize to harlequin iii if the virgins false forgive her fancy was your only foe cupid claims the dart and quiver but it is fancy twangs the bow the fox and the cat a fable the fox and the cat as they traveled one day with moral discourses cut shorter the way tis great says the fox to make justice our guide how godlike is mercy grimalkin replied whilst thus they proceeded  a wolf from the wood impatient of hunger and thirsting for blood rushed forth  as he saw the dull shepherd asleep and seized for his supper an innocent sheep in vain wretched victim for mercy you bleat when muttons at hand says the wolf i must eat grimalkins astonished  the fox stood aghast to see the fell beast at his bloody repast what a wretch says the cat  it is the vilest of brutes does he feed upon flesh when there is herbage  and roots cries the fox  while our oaks give us acorns so good what a tyrant is this to spill innocent blood well onward they marched and they moralizd still till they came where some poultry picked chaff by a mill sly reynard surveyed them with gluttonous eyes and made spite of morals a pullet his prize a mouse too that chanced from her covert to stray the greedy grimalkin secured as her prey a spider that sat in her web on the wall perceived the poor victims and pitied their fall she cried  of such murders how guiltless am i so ran to regale on a new taken fly moral the faults of our neighbors with freedom we blame but tax not ourselves though we practice the same the miller a ballad i in a plain pleasant cottage conveniently neat with a mill and some meadows  a freehold estate a wellmeaning miller by labor supplies those blessings that grandeur to great ones denies no passions to plague him no cares to torment his constant companions are health

prologues and epilogues etc a prologue spoke by mr frodsham at york on the opening of the theater after it was elegantly enlarged once on a time his earthly rounds patrolling your heathen gods were always fond of strolling jove rambled near the cot of kind philemon when night attended by a tempest came on and as the rain fell pattering helter skelter the deity implored the hind for shelter philemon placed his godship close beside him while goody baucis made the fire that dried him with more benevolence than one that is richer he spread the board he filled the friendly pitcher and fond to give his guest a meal of pleasure sung a rough song in his rude country measure jove was so pleased with these goodnatured sallies philemons cot he conjured to a palace taste like great jupiter came here to try us often from the boxes we perceived her spy us whether she liked us and our warm endeavors whether she found that we deserved her favors i know not but it is certain she commanded our humble theater should be expanded the orders she pronounced were scarcely ended but like philemons house the stage extended and thus the friendly goddess bids me greet ye it is in that circle pointing to the boxes she designs to meet ye pedants would fix her residence with heathens but she prefers old york to rome or athens a prologue spoke at the opening an elegant little theater at whitby from shakespeare  johnson  congreve  row  and others  the lawreld list  the true parnassian brothers hither we are sent  by their supreme direction to court your favor and to claim protection our hopes are flattered with the fairs compliance beauty and wit were always in alliance their mutual sway reforms the rude creation and tastes determined by their approbation the tragic muse presents a stately mirror where vice surveys her ugly form with terror and as the fiend departs  abashed  discarded  imperial virtues with the palm rewarded the comic glass  from modern groupes collected shows fops and fools of every class  dissected it marks the fair coquets unfaithful dealings and proves that haughty prudes may have their failings for faults that flow from habit more than nature well

stranded before the moral freight be fairly landed for though with heart and hand we heave together it is your kind plaudit must command the weather nor halcion seas  nor gentle gale attend us till this fair circle with their smiles befriend us a prologue on opening the theater at whitby the ensuing season over the wild waves unwilling more to roam and by his kind affections called for home when the bold youth that every climate tries twixt the blue bosoms  twixt the seas and skies  when he beholds his native albion near and the glad gale gives wings to his career what glowing ecstasies by fancy dressed what filial sentiments expand his breast in the full happiness he forms on shore doubts  dangers  and fatigues are felt no more such are the joys that in our bosoms burn such the glad hopes that glow at our return with such warm ardours you behold us meet to lay  once more  our labors at your feet not without hopes your patronage will last we bend with gratitude for favors past that our light bark defied the rage of winter rode every gale  nor started even a splinter we bow to beauty  it was those smiles secured her and thank our patrons who so kindly moored her still  still  extend your gentle cares to save her that she may anchor long in whitbys  favor a prologue spoke by mr brimyard in the character of a sailor on opening the new theater at northshields without hollo

never behap em than to behold you pleased and hear you  clap em an epilogue spoke by mrs brook at norwich in the character of mrs deborah woodcock in love in a village after the dangers of a long probation when sybil like she is skilled in penetration when she has conquered each unruly passion and rides above the rocks that others dash on when deeply mellowd in reserve and rigor when decent gravity adorns her figure why an old maid  i wish the wise would tell us should be the standing jest of flirts and fellows in maxims sage in eloquence how clever without a subject she can talk  for ever rich in old saws can bring a sentence pat in and quote upon occasion lawyers latin set up that toast that culprit nobus little it is done  and she is demolished in turrorum if an old maids a dragoness on duty to guard the golden fruit of ripening beauty it is right for fear the giddy sex should wander to keep them in restraint by decent  slander when slips are made it is easy sure to find em we can detect before the fair designed em as for the men whose satire often has stung us many there are that may be ranked among us law with long suits and busy mischiefs laden in rancour far exceeds the ancient maiden it is undenyd and the assertions common that modern physic is a mere old woman the puny fop that simpers over his tea dish and cries  indeed  miss debrahs  quite old maidish of doubtful sex of undetermined nature in all respects is but a virgin cretur jesting apart and moral truths adjusting there is nothing in the state itself disgusting old maids as well as matrons bound in marriage are valued from propriety of carriage if gentle sense if sweet discretion guide em it matters not though coxcombs may deride em and virtues virtue be she maid or wedded a certain truth say  debrah woodcock said it a prologue spoke at edinburgh on mrs bellamys first appearance there in early days when error swayed mankind the scene was censured and the stage confined as the fine arts a nobler taste supplied old prejudice grew fainter  drooped  and died merit from sanction must deduce her date if she would arrive at a meridian height from sanction is the english stage become equal to athens and above old rome if from that stage an actress filled with fears new to this northern scene tonight appears intent  however unequal to the flight to hit  what critics call  the happy right she builds not on your sisters london fond applause but timidly to you submits her cause for taste refined may as judicial sit here  as she found her in an english pit your plaudit must remove the strangers fear the sons of genius are the least severe some favor from the fair she is sure to find so sweet a circle cannot but be kind then to your candid patronage she will trust and hopes you gracious  as we know you just a prologue spoke by mr diggs on opening the edinburgh theater in      to rectify some errors that of late had crept into the bosom of our state to court propriety a matron chaste to make strong leagues twixt novelty and taste to alter  to adapt  to plan  revive to spare no pains to make the drama thrive these are the labors that tonight commence by beauty the boxes sanctiond and approved by sense the pit  suppose some corydon  some country swain enamored of some phillis of the plain at early dawn should seek the dappled glade to form a nosegay for the favorite maid when he had cropped the beauties of the banks and culled the fairest from the flowery ranks he would range in order every blooming sweet and lay the little chaplet at her feet so the fair fields of fancy well explore and search the gardens of dramatic lore of choicest fragrance and of various hue to form those chaplets we compose for you now to attack you in a martial strain we hope to gather laurels this campaign and that our plan of action may succeed have marchd fresh forces from beyond the tweed yet as young soldiers may be damped by fear though universal patronage be here let me bespeak before the curtain rise some kind impressions for our new supplies a prologue spoke by mr diggs at edinburgh to the muse of ossian a little piece adapted to the stage from the celebrated poem of ossian the son of fingal to form a little work of nervous merit to give the sleepy stage a nobler spirit to touch a sacred muse and not defile her this was the plan proposed by our compiler though caution told him  the presumptions glaring dauntless he cried  it is but nobly daring can we peruse a pathos more than attic nor wish the golden treasure stamped dramatic here are no lines  in measured pace that trip it no modern scenes  so lifeless  so insipid wrought by a muse  no sacred fire debarred her it is nervous  noble  it is true northern ardour methinks i hear the grecian bards exclaiming the grecian bards no longer worth the naming in song the northern tribes so far surpass us one of their highland hills they will call parnassus and from the sacred mount decrees shall follow that ossian was himself  the true apollo spite of this flash  this high poetic fury he trembles for the verdict of his jury as from his text he never presumed to wander but gives the native ossian to your candor to an impartial judgment we submit him condemn  or rather if you can acquit him an epilogue to the muse of ossian in fond romance let fancy reign creative valor amongst the northern hills is native the northern hills it is proved by ossians story gave early birth to caledonian glory nor could the stormy clime with all its rigor repel in love or war the heros vigor when honor called the youth disdained to ponder and as he fought the favorite maid grew fonder the brave by beauty were rejected never for girls are gracious when the lads are clever if the bold youth was in the field vindictive the bard at home had every power descriptive he swelled the sacred song  enhancd the story and raised the warrior to the skies of glory that northern lads are still unconquered fellows the foes of britain to their cost can tell us the sway of northern beauty if disputed look round ye infidels and stand confuted and for your bards the lettered world have known em they are such  the sacred ossian cannot disown em to prove a partial judgment does not wrong you and that your usual candor reigns among you look with indulgence on this crude endeavor and stamp it with the sanction of your favor an epilogue spoke by mrs bellamy at edinburgh in character of lady fanciful fancy we are told of parentage italic and folly whose original is gallic set up to sale their vain misshapen daughter and britain by a large subscription bought her the fertile soil grew fond of this exotic and nursed her till her power became despotic till every woudbe beauty in the nation did homage at the shrine of affectation but common sense will certainly dethrone her and like the fair ones of this place disown her if she attempts the dimpled smile delightful the dimpled smile of affectations frightful mark but her bagatelles  her whine  her whimper  her loll  her lisp  her saunter  stare  her simper all outres all  no native charm about her and ridicule would soon expire without her look for a grace and affectation hides it if beauty aims an arrow she misguides it so awkwardly she mends unmeaning faces to insipidity she gives  grimaces without her dear coquetish arts to aid em fine ladies might be just as  nature made em such sensible  sincere  domestic creatures the jest of modern belles and petit maitres safe with good sense this circles not in danger but as the foreign phantoms  here a stranger i gave her portrait that the fair may know her and if they meet be ready to forego her for trust me ladies she would deform your faces and with a single glance destroy the graces an epilogue spoke at edinburgh by mrs bellamy to anthony and cleopatra the flame our hero felt for his egyptian is finely drawn it glows in the description but modern love can never maintain its station so many differents gouts divide the nation the man of sense disdains the softening passion the coxcomb is enamored of  the fashion the bon vivant prefers the feast convival and phillis in a turtle finds a rival besides the gentle race  the petit maitres the set insensible of happy creturs so coy  so cold  that beauty never can warm em so nice that nothing but themselves can charm em but hold  i run too fast without refletion each general rule admits of some exceon here boxes  it is allowed imperial beauty  and there pit  the conquered sex adore  sovereigns let me  to wave this bagatelle  declare the grateful homage of an heart sincere i feel your favors with refined delight and glory in my patrons of tonight a prologue spoke by mr diggs at edinburgh to rule a wife it is an odd portrait that the poet drew a strange irregular he sets in view amongst us  thank heaven  the characters unknown bards have creative faculties we own and this appears a picture from his brain till we reflect the lady lived in spain should we the portrait with the sex compare twould add new honors to the northern fair their merit by the foil conspicuous made and they would seem brighter from contrasting shade rude were the rules our fathers formed of old nor should such antiquated maxims hold shall subject man assert superior sway and dare to bid the angel sex obey or if permitted to partake the throne despotic call the reigns of power his own fid it all that is gracious  that is polite the fair to liberty have equal right non urge the tenet though from fletchers school that every husband has a right to rule a matrimonial medium may be hit where neither governs but where both submit the nuptial torch with decent brightness burns where male and female condescend by turns change then the phrase  the horrid text amend and let the word obey be  condescend an eulogium on masonry spoke by mr diggs at edinburgh hail sacred masonry of source divine unerring mistress of the faultless line whose plumb of truth with neverfailing sway makes the joined parts of symmetry obey hail to the craft at whose serene command the gentle arts in glad obedience stand whose magic stroke bids fell confusion cease and to the finished orders yield its place who calls creation from the womb of earth and gives imperial cities glorious birth to works of art her merits not confined she regulates the morals squares the mind corrects with care the tempestworking soul and points the tide of passions where to roll on virtues tablets marks each sacred rule and forms her lodge an universal school where natures mystic laws unfolded stand and sense and science joined go hand in hand o may her social rules instructive spread till truth erect her long neglected head till through deceitful night she dart her ay and beam full glorious in the blaze of day till man by virtuous maxims learn to move till all the peopled world her laws approve and the whole human race be bound in brothers love an epilogue in character of lady townly in the provoked husband at lady  let me recollect  whose night is it no matter  at a circle the politest taste summons all the satire she is able and canvasses my conduct to the table a wife reclaimed and by an husbands rigor a wife with all her appetites in vigor lard  she must make a lamentable figure where was her pride of every spark divested to mend because a prudish husband pressed it what  to prefer his dull domestic quiet to the dear scenes of hurricane and riot parties disclaimed  the happy rout rejected because at ten she is by her spouse expected oh hideous  how immensely out of nature dont ye my dears despise the servile creature prudence although the company be good is often heard and sometimes understood suppose  to justify my reformation she would give the circle this concise oration ye giddy groupe of fashionable wives that in continued riot waste your lives did ye but see the demons that ascend the cares convulsive that on cards attend the midnight specter that surround your chairs  rage reddens here  there avarice despairs you would rush for shelter where contentment lies to the domestic blessings you despise or if you have no regard to moral duty it is trite but true quadrille will murder beauty taste is abashed the culprit i am acquitted they praise the character they lately pitied they promise to reform  relinquish play so break the tables up at  break of day an eulogium on charity spoke at alnwick in northumberland at a charitable benefit play      to bid the rancour of illfortune cease to tell anxiety  i give thee peace to quell adversity  or turn her darts to stamp fraternity on generous hearts for these high motives  these illustrious ends celestial charity tonight descends soft are the graces that adorn the maid softer than dewdrops to the sunburnt glade she is gracious as an unpoluted stream and tender as a fond young lovers dream pity and peace precede her as she flies and mercy beams benignant in her eyes from her high residence from realms above she comes sweet harbinger of heavenly love the countess of northumberland who honored the charity with her presence her sisters charms are more than doubly bright from the kind cause that called her here tonight an artless grace the conscious heart bestows and on the generous cheek a tincture glows more lovely than the bloom that paints the vernal rose the lofty pyramid shall cease to live fleeting the praise such monuments can give but charity by tyrant time revered sweet charity amidst his ruins spared secures her votaries unblasted fame and in celestial annals saves their name a prologue spoke by mrs g  in an itinerant company on reviving the merchant of venice at the time of the bill passing for naturalizing the jews twixt the sons of the stage without pensions or places and the vagabond jews are some similar cases since time out of mind or they are wronged much by slander both lawless alike have been sentenced to wander then faith it is full time we appeal to the nation to be joined in this bill for naturalization lard that words so uncouth  it is so irksome to speak it but it is hebrew i believe and that is taste as i take it well  now to the point  i am sent here with commission to present this fair circle our humble petition but conscious what hopes we should have of succeeding without as they phrase it sufficiently bleeding and convinced we have no funds nor old gold we can rake up like our good brothers  abraham isaac and jacob we must frankly confess we have naught to present ye but shakespeares old sterling  pray let it content ye old shylock the jew whom we mean to restore ye was naturalized often by your fathers before ye then take him tonight to your kindest compassion for to countenance jews is the pink of the fashion an epilogue spoke by mrs g  at her benefit untaught to tread the muses various maze and quite unpracticed in poetic lays i will tell my simple tale in plain familiar phrase in farmers yard i have seen a housewife stand peace in her looks and plenty in her hand dealing her friendly favors on the ground whilst all the neighboring poultry gathers round bold chanticleer in shining plumage gay struts on before and leads the wellknown way his consort next she guides her chattring train impatient to devour the golden grain next stalks the turkeycock above the rest with rosy gills and elevated chest the screaming goose and wadling duck come last alike partakers of the free repast the breakfast done behold each thankless guest some birds like men make gratitude a jest with insolence and pampered pride elate presumes his merit should provide him meat and thinks the hostess thanked that be vouchsafed to eat a linnet perching on a neighboring tree the wellprovided banquet chanced to see she lights and mingling with the motley crew feasted as most at free expense will do then singling from the mercenary throng repaid the generous donor with a song could well wrought numbers with my wish agree the grateful linnet you would behold in me but doomed to silence from my want of skill accept kind patrons of a warm good will an epilogue designed to be spoke at alnwick on resigning the playhouse to a party detached from the edinburgh theater to alnwicks lofty seat a silvan scene to rising hills from distance doubly green go  says the god of wit my standard beat these are the mansions of the great the earl and countess of northumberland lord and lady warkworth etc and fair it is my olympus now go spread my banners there led by fond hope the pointed path we trace and thanked our patron for the flowery place here  we behold a gently waving wood there  we can gaze upon a wandering flood the landscape smiles  the fields gay fragrance wear soft scenes are all around  refreshful air slender repast indeed and but cameleon fare a troop at certain times compelled to shift and from their northern mountains turned adrift by tyrant managers a while consigned to fatten on what forage they can find with lawless force our liberty invades and fain would thrust us from these favorite shades but we since prejudice erects her scale and puffs and petty artifice prevail to stronger holds with cool discretion run and leave the conquerors to be  undone with gratitude still well acknowledge the favors so kindly indulged to our simple endeavors to the great and the fair we rest thankfully debtors and wish we could say we gave place to our betters a prologue for some country lads performing the devil of a wife in the christmas holidays in days of yore when round the jovial board with harmless mirth and social plenty stored our parent britons quaffd their nutbrown ale and carols sung or told the christmas tale in struts st george old englands champion knight with hasty steps impatient to recite how he had killed the dragon once in fight from every side  from troy  from ancient greece princes pour in to swell the motley piece and while their deeds of prowess they rehearse the flowing bowl rewards their hobbling verse intent to raise this evenings cordial mirth like theirs our simple stage play comes to birth our want of art we heartily confess but give you nature in her homespun dress no heroes here  no martial men of might a cobbler is the champion of tonight his straps more famed than georges lance of old for it can tame that dragoness a scold indulgent then support the coblers cause and though he may not deserve it smile applause prologue to the recruiting officer spoke at shrewsbury where mr farquhar is said to have wrote that comedy from the fair mansions of illustrious shades from groves of bliss poetic painted meads should farquhar decked with deathless laurels come obedient to his own recruiting drum conscious tonight of the superior grace the nobler beauties that adorn this place here would he fix  enraptured here abide and change elysium for the severns side let boasting rome of one maecenas tell countless are those that by the severn dwell parnassus mount let future bards disclaim hark how the rekins round the rekin a remarkable mountain in that neighborhood hospitable name swells in the voice of farquhar and of fame mr farquhar dedicated the recruiting officer to his friends  sabrina the poetical name for the river severn  softest nymph that glides along winding and various as her farquhars song indulgent smiled to bless the poets toil and straight his bays bloomed fresh and owned the generous soil here  beauty beams with social sweetness mixed here  true politeness has her standard fixed here  let the muse her sacred numbers swell and here let sportive wit and gay dressed humor dwell o may our secondary labors find the brave propitious and the beauteous kind so may salopian plains that bloom so gay never know a blast but wear perpetual may an epilogue spoke by a child of nine years old as the wise ones within have assured

he strove  oh dire to tell and yet with grief i must the table turned  the china fell a heap of painted dust xi o fatal purport of my dream the fair afflicted cried occasioned i confess my shame by
