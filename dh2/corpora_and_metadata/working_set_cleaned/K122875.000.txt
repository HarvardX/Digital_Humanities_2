epistle from mr theophilus cibber comedian to mr thomas sheridan tragedian  it is a kind of slander to trust to rumor b johnson bella horrida bella lucan the scene often rallies follies of the age laugh in your turn at follies of the stage anon dublin printed in the year mdccxliii  an epistle from mr theophilus cibber comedian to mr thomas sheridan tragedian stephensgreen tuesday afternoon july         mr sheridan your injudicious disappointment of the company last thursday who expected to see you in the character of cato and your indiscreet attempt to dismiss the audience having as you confess become a towntalk and given rise to many idle falsehoods merely calculated to injure the innocent you must excuse me if i relate the fact strictly adhering to truth there were many witnesses of what i am about to declare and i know none except yourself whose memory is weak enough to forget it or will be hardy enough to deny it  when it drew near the time proper to begin the play mr giffard and myself were alarmed in the dressing room with a report that you declared you would not play because you had not the same robe you wore in that character before and that you said the audience must be dismissed this reason for dismissing an audience proposed by you who had no right to dismiss them appeared to me so weak i could not believe it till you came into the room and swore unless you had that robe you would not act this declaration i looked upon as a rash expression the mere effect of your then ruffled temper but could not yet suppose you would proceed so idly as you did you were then completely dressed from head to foot as well as ever the character was dressed in any theater in ireland or england all but the robe  upon enquiry it appeared the robes wore by cato juba and sempronius the first night were borrowed by philips of some gentlewoman in this town who bought them in an auction at london some time since but were by no means the property of the managers or any one belonging to the theater nor were to be got that night so all the heroes were equally disappointed of those trappings your impatience increased and though another robe was brought you the same robe that was made new this year for mr husband in the character of julius caesar you persisted in having the other uncomeatable robe or you positively would undress and was determined not to play to every bodys surprise you did undress and in spite of the most friendly remonstrances to the contrary you made a broken kind of speech to the audience with which they were so dissatisfied they could not help showing it  before you went on i entreated you on the mere exchange of a robe not to do so unpolitic a thing i might add unpolite as to think of disappointing the town of their diversion you replied the vexation had deprived you of your voice and rendered you incapable of performing i desired you to consider the first act was of such a considerable length you might have time enough to recover your temper and your voice would probably return with it or if the defect lasted your attempting to perform would appear so obliging the audience would readily make any allowances when they knew you had been ruffled etc but to think of giving them no play at all was what i could not but conceive would offend them  to repeat all was said to you on this occasion would add to the tediousness of this recital but as near as i can remember nothing was omitted in the most friendly manner to dissuade you from your mistaken purpose  i am informed you stayed afterward just long enough to hear the extraordinary indulgent reception the audience were pleased to bestow on my proposing with their leave to give them the play in the best manner we could since it was not in our power to give it them so well as we would you then ran hastily out of the house and sent a message afterward to the theater that you would not by any means have your name delivered out for another play for you would positively act no more  i should not mr sheridan have given you or myself this trouble but for the many reports that fly about of which it is said you are the author and since i have advanced so far i must go a little farther and make a w honest queries then giving you a little advice shall submit to the determination of the public whether i as it has been insinuated ever intended you the least prejudice or on the contrary have not always acted toward you with good manners and good nature  first then  have i not your letter by me sent to me when in england wherein you express yourself very desirous of my acting in the same theater with you and are solicitous for my coming over  and do you not know your particular application since my arrival was one of my strongest motives for playing in smockalley where i am likely to have a lawsuit for my right with the managers though i was offered the same terms from aungierstreet playhouse where my agreement would have been signed by a gentleman of honor whose pay is as good as the bank  have i not on your return to the stage this season in compliment to you played some inferior characters which it is well known i had a long time resigned to younger actors in england  did i omit any care or grudge any pains to keep the audience in temper when your sudden indisposition prevented your playing the first intended night of king lear or could i for a brother have been more active to silence the reports then made to your prejudice  sed tu brute  have not i desired you though our remaining nights of playing were few and we had large sums at stake to fix the plays to your own mind  have not you been paid a large part of that fresh agreement you made but did not complete while we are unpaid our agreements though we have it is notorious often solicited the managers to release us if they found the emptiness of the town would not answer their continuing our performance  but we could get neither our liberty nor our money  have not you often been an earwitness of these proposals and as often declard we behaved with the greatest lenity and strictest honor  did not your sudden breaking off from playing leave us in a displeasing dilemma and was it not reasonable for us to propose acting such pieces as might excite the greatest curiosity in the town whereby the managers might be enabled to pay us and the rest of the company  did i not decline till your positive declaration that you would play no more this season appearing in any character you had performed and did you not xpress yourself as obliged to me on making you that compliment as you were pleased to term it  how comes it then mr sheridan reported that mr giffard and my self have intended you any injury or from whence is it said that we ridiculous as false locked up your clothes and did all we could to prevent your playing this sir has been so frequently asserted as a fact related by you that you ought as a friend to truth to have fully answered such monstrous falsehoods or may we not reasonably suppose you did spread such reports if you can be the author of such naughty tales what language is fit to paint you  the letters i read this day in the dublin journal if not ipso facto yours are yet so worded an impartial reader cannot but see they were at least the work of some mistaken friend whose good nature you had imposed on by false relations from whom but you could come the satisfactory reasons not one of which are mentioned for your not performing or the poor low invectives and mean inuendoes therein contained  whom do you mean by designing wretches and theatrical politicians or what can you intend but to insinuate you have been artfully drove from the stage when you know your absence from thence is absolutely your own act and deed  fie fie stick to truth or be ashamed of such public addresses or to show your face after them  may not one suppose master sheridan the kind and civil intention of these two letters is to create a disturbance in the future audiences  but let me inform you when a rebuff to an actor appears premeditated and bespoke from prejudice such treatment may put a poor player out of humor but sure it ought not to put him out of countenance  if you withdraw yourself from the theater for a time must all diversion stop till your return if a vintner has not ortelans or any other extraordinary dainties in the larder will his guests think it impertinent if they are entreated to take such homely entertainment as the house affords  and if the defects of others serve as a foil to the brilliancy of your performance why should you be angry at what if you would keep your temper might prove so consolable to you  dear tommy dont prove such a dog in a manger if you dont choose oats why should you starve the rest of the theatrical cattle have more compassion on your fellow creatures or fellow comedians  but master tommy may we not shrewdly suspect though your performances have been hitherto mostly tragical you have given your mind a little bent toward comedy and in those studies have taken a hint from congreves petulant who to keep up an extraordinary reputation was notorious under a disguise for calling for himself at a coffeehouse where he would sometimes in a mask send in for himself wait for himself nay and not finding himself would frequently leave a letter for himself  faith you are highly in luck in improving a hint i find  but let me ask you a home question  has not a great deal of that suss of mind you have lately shown been more owing to your disappointment that the audience would not depart when you declared your high and mighty displeasure because you had not the selfsame gewgaw tinsel train more than from any fears you had of having displeased them or was it nangry because any one was permitted under great disadvantages merely to attempt what they had never in their lives a thought of performing why this is the passionate extravaganza of our brother pistol who scorning all contradiction or competition bounces about in his boots kicks his heels with fury against the stage and swelled with swaggering rage and nonsense cries shall dunghill curs confront with helicon etc  shall packhorses and hollow pampered jades of asia that cannot travel thirty miles a day compare with caesar and with cannibals and with trojan greeks etc etc but as our friend concludes shall we fall foul for toys   though i dont think there is any thing personally terrible about you yet i own you a gentleman of great formidability who have the power if you say true and you know you have talked at that pawpaw rate of calling down the barracks on any one you condescend to be displeased with pray do you mean the stone buildings for i cannot suppose you presume to have any command over the gentlemen there as i never heard of any commission the king had yet honored you with and i believe there is hardly any there will think it worth their while to attend the call of your whistle to a silly riot i am rather inclinable to think the worthy spirits there are more impatient to attend the call of a trumpet at this glorious juncture and be in actions worthy of them  and for the gentlemen of the college sir no insinuation shall make me dread ill usage from those whose birth and education will never suffer em to hurt the innocent nor can i affront em with so ungenteel a thought that they will be the tools of your wrong placed resentment  mr sheridan your behavior has extorted this from me and as your conscience must tell you i never meant you the least injury should you by any little art aim through pique or passion unhospitably to hurt a stranger it would be an act that wants a name and require such language to answer as would but ill become the mouth of a gentleman or be fitting for the ears of the public  as my stay here will be very short i but desire what i will not doubt meeting with a candid reception for the few nights i have to play from the goodnatured town whose past favors i am proud of to confess them is but an act of gratitude nor will i therefore think my self liable to the imputation of a boasting vanity  let me mr sheridan give you this friendly caution  do not run into an error most young men in our business have been too guilty of who think their merits are but barely paid when their reception is most favorable and take that as their due which is mostly the effect of a generous disposition in the town to encourage and support a rising genius whenever it appears  though people may be as fond of such for a while as gallants are of a new mistress yet if vanity and caprice prevail in such performer grown wild and wanton with success they know when to withdraw their favors nor is it easy to regain them  if i ever see you in england i will be most unmercifully revenged of you for your mistakes toward me and will absolutely endeavor to make your reception there as pleasing to you as you may have wished mine should have been here displeasing to me but let us now mind our business and no more trouble the public with our theatricalimportantnothings  they will but laugh at us for our pains  i am yours etc t c
