apology for the life and writings of david hume esquire entered at stationershall  an apology for the life and writings of david hume esquire with a parallel between him and the late lord chesterfield to which is added an address to one of the people called christians by way of reply to his letter to adam smith lld  for modes of faith let graceless zealots fight his cannot be wrong whose life is in the right pope london printed for fielding and walker no  0 paternoster row d prince oxford t and j merrill cambridge and w creech edinburgh       to william strahan esquire sir the late mr david hume has left to your care the publication of his posthumous papers as there is every reason to believe they turn upon similar researches with such as have been already printed or as it is more likely they may carry his philosophy still nearer to that point which he might not think it discreet to push too vigorously in his lifetime the critical and christian clamor no doubt will be raised afresh against him it is well known sir that you were considered by mr hume in a much higher light than that of a mere publisher there was apparently a mixture of trust and tenderness as well as a good opinion of you officially blended with the idea of his connection his memory therefore and the honors or disgraces which shall hereafter attend it must in a particular manner interest and affect you as he was your most excellent friend his friendship and the virtues which produced it are i trust never to be forgotten  dr adam smith has signed his name to a letter at the close of which he thus concisely sums up the character of mr hume  i have always considered him both in his lifetime and since his death as approaching as nearly to the idea of a perfectly wise and virtuous man as perhaps the nature of human frailty will permit  it has been long imagined that persons who were tinctured in any degree with that philosophy which mr hume was supposed to favor could not possibly have any title to such a character as is here drawn by dr smith that gentleman however has with a commendable fortitude asserted the virtues of his deceased friend  the object of the following pages is a confirmation of that assertion as well as a philosophical plea for the justice on which it is founded  three other views however are connected with the design of this apology some personal knowledge of mr hume some expectation of the popular censure which will soon be revived against him if not against his affectionate dr smith and a wish i have long entertained to have a fit opportunity of introducing such strictures on the most atrocious species of dissimulation as will be found in the course of the work are all arguments which have had a share in making it public  my thoughts have indeed been thrown upon paper in haste yet they are by no means hasty thoughts but have resulted from contemplating the death of mr hume some months before it actually happened  in short sir it is conceived these remarks upon the life death consistency and philosophy of david hume may very properly precede any new edition of his works  may likewise do some service to the writer and some to the man place truth and the affectation of it like the sun and its shadow in the water side by side in order to show the splendor of one and the mockery of the other  as to yourself sir it would be an insult upon your feelings not to suppose every thing of this nature is acceptable  i am your most obedient servant the author  preliminary address reader be not startled at the title of this performance it means no ill either to you or your religion of whatever cast that religion may be the apology here offered to your inspection that truth or christianity itself would not of their own accord admit i beseech you to peruse these detached thoughts from the beginning to the end and indulge the impulses of the pauser reason before you determine upon any of the subjects here treated with that liberality which becomes the independent spirit of scientific enquiry in a free state an apology for the philosophy of the metaphysical mr hume appears to denote in this suspicious age to be either abstruse or difficult or else dangerous and deistical from this work fear neither of these it is written without profaneness or irreverence it promotes all morality flowing from all faiths and it corrects all hypocrisy wherever it is detected the prostitution of christianity or in other words the christian religion made use of as a cloak to cover the most irreligious purposes is more fatal to the supreme governor of the world and to his subordinate creatures than a much greater latitude of principle than was indulged by mr hume avowed atheism itself is not half so bad as concealed deception especially when it takes refuge under the plausable and unsuspected robe of christian professors an extraordinary something betwixt superstition and popery pleads in favor of this worst species of enormity for which reason it is less chastised than any other common minds which are terribly trammeled by any shallow signals of authority are afraid of yielding to the suggestions of their own understanding and so the evil is permitted through mere vulgar cowardice to arise till the effects of the mischief become almost irreparable hence it is also that the truth of a whole library were it closely analyzed and then consolidated to the exclusion of every thing adventitious and imaginary  the whole amount of matter of fact with respect to things important would be reduced to a few scanty volumes or at most supply the shelves of a small bookcase  having a due veneration for the rights of the press i have here i hope not unadvisedly ventured to investigate subjects or rather to start hints which a pusilanimity very prejudicial to candid enquiry has commonly passed over i have started matters which it is to be wished were more philosophically pursued by some able hand and i am not without hope that what is here rudely sketched will be formed into a correcter system by a masterly writer  in the mean time what is offered in the subsequent pages however it may offend the zealots will not be ill received by those who are liberal and consistent  an apology etc section i of humes philosophical consistency david hume is dead never were the pillars of orthodoxy so desperately shaken as they are now by that event it was attended by every thing that contradicts the general prophecy concerning it he has proved himself in opposition to a contrary opinion one of those rare characters which so seldom adorn either this or any other country to wit an uniform philosopher he is one of the few who died in the practice of precepts which he laid down in the earliest periods of a speculative life the last scene is lately painted by himself and every touch of it corresponds corroborates and confirms those which preceded it he took up the pen to prove his consistency at a crisis commonly esteemed by men the most alarming and pathetic air physic exercise and the alleviating solicitudes of friendship were all tried and were all ineffectual even adulation which is so seldom unwelcome either to the sick or healthy was not able to seduce our philosopher into the hope of an existence protracted beyond the limits of a few months  i happened to come into his room said one of his most respectable friends when he was reading a letter sent him by colonel edmondstone who had written an eternal adieu to him and which mr hume immediately showed to me i told him that though i was sensible how very much he was weakened and that appearances in many respects were very bad yet his cheerfulness was still so great the spirit of life seemed still to be so very strong in him that i could not help entertaining some faint hopes he answered your hopes are groundless an habitual diarrhoea of more than a years standing would be a very bad disease at any age at my age it is a mortal one when i lie down in the evening i feel myself weaker than when i rose in the morning and when i rise in the morning weaker than when i lay down in the evening i am sensible besides that some of my vital parts are affected so that i must soon die  i have admitted this extract because it marks in the most vivid colors the invariable practical consistency of hume to his own theory those to whom that theory is obnoxious wished and expected a very different deportment of its author in his last moments the more especially if those moments were past which was the case under the declinings of a disorder that should waste the body without impairing the mind the persons who maintained opposite and what is esteemed correcter tenets imagined that all the subtlety of a skepticism avowed in the vigor of gay and glowing youth and of arguments to support them written when the pulse was full among the ardours of science and for the sake of singularity would upon the bed of a lingering distemper all fly off as the prospect of dissolution became apparent and leave their author in the agonies of terrorstruck repentance or in the horrors of overwhelming despair i myself know one person in particular and he still living and not unknown in the christian world who prognosticated the most tragical exit to david hume  take my word for it sir said he one day to me the triumph of that man meaning hume is shortlived he breaks apace from an almost athletic corpulency he is within a few months shrunk into the very shadow of himself i hear he still affects his accustomed gaiety and persists in his unchristian principles but this conduct will wear away in proportion as he gets worse and worse as dean swift stands upon record the victim of disappointment pique pride ill nature so i foresee will david hume be a mournful example of that vain and vicious philosophy which he has long had the audacity to espouse methinks i already see him sir in the extremity tortured at once by the lashes of his conscience and laboring to continue life that he may publicly give the lie to his former horrible documents poor wretch  i pity him i could almost wish his prayer granted that he might do some justice to posterity and in that justice propitiate the wrath the omnipotent wrath which must necessarily be kindled against him instead of which  shocking reverse  observe him struggling at the same time with death and with a thorough consciousness of having misguided mankind of having endeavored to undermine the foundation of religion  and of meriting detestation  in all the phrenzy of a fiery zeal bordering i fear somewhat upon bigotry did a celebrated christian author as near as i can recollect in these words foretell the miseries of david hume and in the same furor of language has he doubtless been treated by many others on the perusal of that pamphlet which states the accounts of his last illness and all the concomitant circumstances that attended it i should like much as a matter of curiosity only to know the unaffected state of their feelings their prophecy is at all events unfulfilled and what is worse all the minute articles which are generally the most marking rather add to than deduct from the great aggregate of their consternation  in justice to the memory of an extraordinary man who has it is presumed many secret and many public enemies at least in a literary and scientific sense it is worth while to take a view of some of those points which prove him beyond the possibility of a dispute to be at least a sincere believer in his own sentiments many indeed will think that this however perspicuously proved will be doing him no real honor since in proportion to the clearness of the evidence upon this matter it will only show his impiety and obstinate insidelity the plainer thereby in the end incurring upon him a more general disgrace i am of a different opinion the terms infidelity impiety and atheisin should not be lavishly trusted from the lip we should not presume to deal damnation through the land on each we deem our foe  but it is less the design of these papers to defend humes principles than to show upon the best authority that he was earnest in what he wrote and that through every part of his life even to the very moment of his death he made precept and practice go amicably hand in hand together first however be it observed that whatever might be the force of his faith no one it is conjectured will charge him with having neglected good works i do not pretend to say how far those are or are not sufficient such enquiries are digressive from my subject at the same time i could wish and sure it is but a reasonable request that for these he may have a proper degree of credit  perhaps it is one of the very worst circumstances against the cause of christianity that very few of its professors were ever either so moral so humane or could so philosophically govern their passions as the skeptical david hume the simple dictates of this gentlemans own heart unassisted by those examples and sacred sentiments which are supposed to inspire universal love and good will amongst men inspired him to practice all the duties decencies and charities thus hume the unbeliever as he has been called led a life that might even when scrutinized by the eye of malevolence itself call a blush into the cheeks of those who would fain be thought in the imaginations of men to be steadfast and immovable in the faith it is not a little shocking to thinking people to perceive that the spirit of hypocrisy so generally gone forth and it is still worse to see that hypocrisy according to the assurance of a late lord so generally successful and carry all before it  it demands alas no search into the records of antiquity to prove that the christian world prosecutes this duplicity with a vigor to which the skeptic hume never had the infamy to stoop i do not say this is an argument to destroy or to invalidate the faith of christians but i will take upon me to say it is a dreadful symptom of an unfoundness in its professors and friends when they so commonly skulk behind the holy shield of their religion as a hiding place from the eyes of the world whenever they have a mind to do any thing in direct opposition to its most obvious and elementary principles either the religion is somewhere defective in itself which i by no means think so likely as the alternative or else the votaries themselves have a much worse opinion of its real origin than skeptics because were not one of these or perhaps a mixture of them both the fact surely they could not so much oftener than those skeptics act in general defiance of its maxims i however principally confine myself to that miserable hypocrisy which has so very frequently been discovered amongst the votaries of this amiable religion and in particular such of them as have gained the greatest popularity by an oftentatious display of it i beg these sentiments may not be thought to have any tendency to hurt the christian religion of whose excellence i am not now to treat yet till some of its professors can by the conjunction of faith and good works backed by the prospect of futurity surpass or at least equal the virtues of a man who was tender friendly generous and social let these vain glorious boasters have the modesty to hold their tongues and speak nothing since nothing can be spoken but to their disgrace  it is to the honor of david hume then that he was no hypocrite in philosophy and that unlike the many detected hypocrites in christianity he acted as he wrote and wrote no more than at all times he actually felt  this may be evidenced more accurately when we run our eye over that posthumous paper which he has very characteristically called a funeral oration prior to this i would just turn an old subject on a new side i would make a comment or two on that shameful species of delusion which arrayed in the fair and unsuspicious robes of orthodoxy makes the most fatal depredations upon society and indeed does infinitely more mischief than the most daring and declared infidelity  section ii of religious hypocrisy one of the distinguishing features by which we mark the present age is religious hypocrisy or that abominable prudery in sentiment which from the lip outward deceives the shallow multitude who mistake it for the conscientious scruples of moral sanctity a philosopher who looks into the heart and can trace many of its maneuvers to their source whose acquaintance with life and whose skill in detecting the chicane of men sees clearly at a single glance that the whole apparatus of external appearance is only a political veil thrown over the real feelings and propensities of nature this fallacy to his penetrating eye is sufficiently obvious he detects the cheat in a moment and did he not know how easily the major part of mankind were disposed to favor that which suits equally their own purposes of imposing upon each other by which means the hypocrisy be comes general he would wonder how those who are supposed to stand at the top of rarefied and rationalized matter could be so constantly the bubbles of imagination bubbles however they notoriously are in defiance of the very feelings which contradict their puritanical pretensions this duplicity has ever existed in life and has now crept into letters there is a set of writers who affect a chastity of sentiment and a kind of primitive preciseness in style with a view of passing upon the superficial part of the public which is infinitely the larger part as orthodox moralists and the most zealous promoters of christian rectitude copious is the catalogue of authors whose performances are read and relished upon this very principle  hence it is that literary reputation like almost every other distinction is in these times merely empirical it is nevertheless not unamusing to a philosopher  when he has a mind to relieve himself from the labor of severer thinking with the petty concealments of the busy and more vacant world  to overturn with a calmness peculiar to his collected character the superficial systems of these ingenious impostors  when i have felt myself in a humor that disposes to such pleasant pastime when i can descend from worthier sciences to the little designs which men have upon each other i have totally destroyed the whole web of hypocrisy and discovered in plausible maxims more tendencies to vice and immorality or else more insincerity than in any writings of avowed luxury and licentiousness our modern moralists especially of the sacred order have the art of making virtue terrible and vice an object of indifference like an unskilful painter they dissigure the native amiableness of the one by certain rigid strokes of the pencil too formidable to be seen with pleasure and they pourtray the marking features of the other either so loosely or ludicrously that as we have no violent desire to possess the one so have we no remarkable disgust to the other nay our refined moral mongers advance much farther religion herself a word for ever at the tip of their tongues and the very god of it a term even more in common usage suffers at the very time they pretend the contrary like the handwriting upon the wall it is upon record against the consistency of some of our dabblers in morals that they have described the deity infinitely more like a devil than a god they tell us he is all merciful and all benevolent and yet very gravely insist his punishments are extreme and his anger on particular occasions eternal they describe him as armed with a flaming sword to destroy the unhappy compound of those passions which they allow he has himself implanted they talk of his having propensely hardened the heart of the sinner as he did that of pharaoh and yet that he rewards with plague and pestilence the creature whom he has destined to disobedience they enlarge much upon his tenderness and yet observe in one and the same page that the crimes of the father shall be visited on the children even unto the fourth generation i appeal to the man who has fortitude enough to think one moment for himself whether the omnipotent thus delineated is not rather dishonored than glorified are such inconsistent qualities possible to an essence all pure immutable uncontradictory the real character of the universal parent is clouded confused and enveloped in the thick fog of human opinions and human inventions rewards and punishments are doubtless held out to men as proper examples to encourage and to deter but they should never be injudiciously blended as confounded one with the other  how much happier would be the consequence how much more would it do honor to the christian cause if divines and moralists were to inculcate both in their public orations and writings that species of morality sentiment philosophy or whatever else you please to call it which draws the portraits of virtue with all possible amiableness which is finely colored which has recourse both to eloquence and poetry in order to attract and entertain rather than to affright and disgust doubtless more may be done by inviting than by insisting especially in cases of duty and obedience which are in themselves i conceive not very consistent with the pride or the dignity of human nature true it is that a severe master may by the power of that very severity create in a servant a kind of momentary veneration but the very instant he is out of the presence of his superior he admits of necessity a mixed sentiment of hatred and terror this mode of argument may soar from familiar life to the last splendid degrees of that preternatural grandeur and power which divines impute to the deity i ask the reader if after having heard any discourse in which providence has been described in all its terrors as holding out on the one hand the horrors of perdition and displaying on the other the signs of unrelenting and implacable resentment against beings confessedly imperfect i ask if he does not come away from such discourse impressed rather with a sense of almighty revenge and barbarity than with the comfortableideas and all their cheerful associations of fairer and more alluring attributes mr hume has himself noticed this contradiction thus it may safely be affirmed that popular religions are really in the conception of their more vulgar votaries a species of daemonism and the higher the deity is exalted in power and knowledge the lower of course is he depressed in goodness and benevolence whatever epithets of praise may be bestowed on him by his amazed adorers among idolaters the words may be false and belie the secret opinion but among more exalted religionists the opinion itself often contracts a kind of falsehood and belies the inward sentiment the heart secretly detests such measures of cruel and implacable vengeance but the judgment dares not but pronounce them perfect and adorable and the additional misery of this inward struggle aggravates all the other terrors by which these unhappy victims to superstition are for ever haunted lucian observes that a young man who reads the history of the gods in homer or hesiod and finds their factions wars injustice incest adultery and other immoralities so highly celebrated is much surprised afterward when he comes into the world to observe that punishments are by law inflicted on the same actions which he had been taught to ascribe to superior beings the contradiction is still perhaps stronger between the representations given us by some latter religions and our natural ideas of generosity lenity impartiality and justice and in proportion to the multiplied terrors of these religions the barbarous conceptions of the divinity are multiplied upon us nothing can preserve untainted the genuine principles of morals in our judgment of human conduct but the absolute necessity of these principles to the existence of society if common conception can indulge princes in a system of ethics somewhat different from that which should regulate private persons how much more those superior beings whose attributes views and nature are so totally unknown to us sunt superis sua jura the gods have maxims of justice peculiar to themselves  and again in another place with still greater conciseness how is the deity disfigured in our representations of him what caprice absurdity and immorality are attributed to him how much is he degraded even below the character which we should naturally in common life ascribe to a man of sense and virtue not hist relig    this makes it obvious that the great arguments for belief of christianity and love of its origin are commonly mistaken even by those who professionally preach every sunday upon the subject the frowns of god may terrify into an extorted obedience as we may frighten a child or a domestic into the very falsehood for which we are at that moment chiding him but this is in effect making god the cause of our hypocrisy timorous minds indeed and those who do not understand the phenomena of nature may dread the found of the thunder imputing that found not to any thing in the order of nature which is agreeable to the very construction of the universe and the regular operations of the material system but to the immediate displeasure of the deity thus it is that after any great calamity whether public or private such as the effusion of much blood by the success of our national enemies or the sudden reduction of any family an unexpected transition from affluence to imprisonment for instance it is common enough for ignorant people to inflict upon themselves very severe and unnecessary rigours by way it it presumed of propitiating the wrath of providence than which by the bye there cannot possibly be shown to that providence a greater indignity for does not this conduct evidently imply that god requires to be first thanked for having made men miserable and then bribed by flattery lest that misery should be continued  i may receive a stroke of illfortune with a proper degree of firmness with all the decencies of resignation i may bear my burden either as a philosopher or as a christian but i can never be persuaded to believe that any being can be barbarously delighted with the horrible incense of sighs and tears or that he exacts such a diabolical sacrifice and expects at the same time that we should call it devotion it is downright wickedness the whole of the matter then amounts to this  to make men in love with any superior power he who represents to us the extent and the nature of that power must take great care lest he destroys the hypothesis he means to support  to effect this it is not necessary to make that power a mere fool of goodnature any more than it is to make him a tyrant of cruelty  would we wish to inspire a stranger with a favorable idea of any of our acquaintance we do begin his character by saying that if he is once offended thoroughly he will not only pursue the offenders to the verge of the grave but even carry his resentment into the coffin and maliciously scatter the bones in testimony of the stillsurviving vigor of his resentment neither do we say that he will wreak his vengeance on the widow or her now orphan children because this would effectually deter from forming any sort of connection with so execrable a wretch no we take the fairer side of the argument we dwell upon such parts of his character as naturally recommend him to reason and the sensibilities nay rather than let him want a cubit to the dignity or amiableness of his moral stature we venture to draw a compliment or two from the metaphors of imagination nor do we quit the charming subject till we have prepared the mind to expect the most delightful pleasures in his society  such is exactly the case with the more magnificent image of the deity whom we shall always honor in proportion as his attributes are represented through the medium of gentleness forgiveness and complacency  there seems however no little share of ignorance in painting thus publicly the deity in a passion in giving him obstinacy ill will ill nature and all the turbulances of a rigorous taskmaster especially where the servants themselves are by the necessity of their natures presentenced to obey those necessities  the trite and very vulgar argument of free will with all the futile doctrine of agencies which have unluckily employed so many thousands reams of paper fall to the very earth and mix with the dust of it upon the honest scrutiny of those that are not to be deluded by the jargon of mere pulpit debate  but i should by entering upon this at present take a much greater latitude than is now expedient my design being not so much to digress from my subject as to incorporate what seems in its nature analagous to wit some philosophical strictures on the danger of popular hypocrisy in sacred matters and on a mode of dissimulation in sentiment which dishonours the frank and liberal spirit of true science but our puritans of the press take especial care to write very religiously without any meaning at all without indeed having any determinate idea of that delicate partition which divides one specific quality from another without any sober system of either thinking writing or acting i have been entertained with the ingenuities of men i call them ingenuities because sometimes they really are such who have volumniously recommended a something the practice of which was to produce tranquillity and complacence which was equally to defy distemper accident and revolution this something they recommend without bringing one solid argument in its favor the fuller proof of this matter together with a free and fair enquiry into popular religions and their regulating principles is preparing for the press by the author of this apology and will it is hoped clear from rubbish our muchobstructed idea on sacred subjects  in their way they reason about it and about it till the original idea if indeed they ever had such is utterly annihilated if therefore their misconceptions and blunders are thus manifest in devotional subjects it may be expected that they are not much more accurate or perspicuous in the manufacture of writings adapted simply to what is called the decencies and decorums of social life i shall however as an instance confine myself to expose the futility of what they call with most atrocious affectation delicacy of sentiment two words to which divested of their popular hypocritical meaning imply more actual grossness and downright sensuality than all that ever was written by rochester or any other licentious author rochester indeed showed too much to raise desire he made us delicate even from his indelicacy we behold his dirty illdisposed figures in all their nastiness and nudity the mind takes part with the body and recoils from enjoyment but it is otherwise with writers that are eternally showing you the sentimental infamy of a personal trespass to which nature they own with all her attractive force and vigor inclines while they condemn us to flame and faggot if we yield to her dictates it is the fault of these men that they too often remind us of agreeable error they minutely discover the temptation and point to the most irresistible parts of it yet charge us neither to touch nor to enjoy it this is shameful but it is notwithstanding the basis of many literary reputations  section iii on the natural dignity of the literary character and the reasons which have brought it into contempt let us now advert to another species of hypocrisy from which our philosopher was totally exempt to which indeed his temper was perfectly superior among the instances of generous independency in david hume must not be forgotten that manliness which prevented him from wading through the the prostituted puddle of fawning dedication to this magnanimity  to this firmness it was owing that his feelings were never disgraced nor his spirit at any time weighed down by the burden of favors ignominiously begged and ungraciously bestowed alexander when he had won his world had less reason to sing forth the io pean of triumph than had our author to gratulate himself on the satisfaction of never having preferred a request to one great man or ever of having made advances to any of them to confess the truth he wrote generally upon subjects of which the modern nobility are for the most part so contemptibly ignorant that to have inscribed performances so scientific to such patrons would involve the philosopher in a similar error of judgment indeed nothing is more offensive to men of true taste and right feeling than the condescension of persons of genius to persons of rank merely as such this it is more than any thing else that has helped to degrade the literary character which as it implies a superior vigor of intellect and a more enlarged capacity possesses naturally an unrivalled dignity according to all the systems of all the sects it is allowed that the human understanding is the greatest as it is the most boasted distinction of human beings consequently one of these beings must rise higher than another in the scale of rationality only by so much as the distinguishing part of him is elevated above that of others so likewise a shallow illiterate and vacant creature must sink in the scale by the same equitable proportion now it is easy to prove that what are called the great who are but too commonly the least of all gods little atoms must according to the very nature of things be amongst the worst judges of literary merit and therefore speaking truly its most improper patrons men born to titles and to fortunes which descend without effort or exertion of any talent whatever imagine the cultivation of the mind totally adventitious nor does the man of fashion admit it into the catalogue of his accomplishments even the harlequin lord chesterfield  that successful smatterer  allows only such a share of philosophy as belongs to the philosophy of the passions which is nothing more in his idea than guarding yourself while you make a fine dextrous and successful push at the passions of another giddiness glitter the indolence of plenty and above all its impudence all contribute to render persons of rank srivolous voluble superficial the illustrious exceptions of a bacon a bolingbroke a shaftesbury a lyttelton a prussia a clarendon have nothing to do with a rule so deplorably general  this being die case can any thing be so preposterous as to inscribe to the mere tinsel of titles the labors of learning or the reflections of accurate and abstruse philosophy yet has this been for many ages the practice whence has it happened the question cannot be answered without affecting us  fortune seems to have neglected those whom nature has most favored and men of genius i suppose think it but fair to supply the defect by soliciting men of money this solicitation however subjects them to all that rudeness and disdain which those who have only a handful of authority bestow upon their flatterers the flatterers are in turn well served they set out upon a wrong principle  the intercourse is altogether ill managed dedications being another source of our national hypocrisy deserve a more correct investigation it has been just observed that they are fundamentally false  a dedication admits of two distinct definitions of which one belongs to the patron and one to the author the patron not only receives every untruth that can be expressed in the pride of panegyric as his due but believes at the same time that he receives it from an unprovided being who is to exist for a certain space of time upon the success of his encomium something therefore is usually sent to keep  for i would adopt the great mans language  the poor devil of an author from starving the authors definition is on the other hand so servile as to deduct from every sentiment of pity and make us confess the justice of his disgrace  he is contented to lavish praises of which the best man on earth might blush to be the objects and he expects a golden reward proportionate to the violent colorings of the varnish and to the fainter or fuller blaze of the lie courteous i have collected a few of these shameful panegyrics and thrown them into a note by way of illustration speaking of a man and woman whom the poet never saw he has these expressions  example i i could not answer it to the world nor to my conscience if i gave not your lordship my testimony of your being the best husband now living you my lord though it is not my happiness to know you may stand aside with the small remainders of the english nobility truly such etc dryden  example ii i assure your grace this dedication is the result of a profound acknowledgment an artless inclination proudly glad and grateful and if ever the influence of your graces more shining qualities should persuade me to attempt a tragedy i shall then borrow all the ornamental virtues from your greatness of birth sweetness of temper flowing from the fixed and native principles of courage and honor beauties that i reserve for a further opportunity of expressing my zeal and gratitude colley cibber  example iii the protection of the most distinguished produces a kind of inspiration much superior to that which the heathenish poets pretended to derive from their fictitious apollo my ambition is to address one of my weak performances to your lordship who are justly justly allowed by universal consent to be the best judge of all kinds of writing i was indeed at first deterred from my design by a thought that it might be accounted unpardonable rudeness to obtrude a trifle of this nature to a person whose sublime wisdom moderates the council which at this critical juncture overrules the fate of all europe mrs centlivre  example iv i shall not grow tedious by entering into the usual style of dedications for my pen cannot accompany my heart when i speak of your grace and i am now writing to the only person living to whom such a panegyric would be displeasing henry fielding  example v you did not think it madam beneath you to be officially good even from the extremest height to discover the lowest creature to have your graces favor is in a word to have the applause of the whole court who are its noblest ornament magnificent and eternal praise something there is in your mein so much above what we call charming that to me it seems adorable and your presence almost divine you possess a fullness of perfection to hear you speak is methinks to hear our tutelar angels but to behold you too is to make prophets quite forget their heaven and bind the poets with eternal rapture your grace is the most beautiful idea of love and glory and to that divine composition have the noblest and best natured wit in the world not lee  example vi nature and fortune were certainly in league when your grace were born and as the first took care to give you beauty enough to enslave the hearts of all the world so the other resolved to do its merit justice that none but a monarch sit to rule the world should ever possess it and in it he had an empire thomas otway  i have not ascertained the property of any of these highflown nonsensical passages as belonging to any particular person because they are all so much in the same style that they may with equal propriety be inscribed to all the patrons in the world it may however be well enough to take notice that the shallowest understanding in nature might have penetration enough to see the absurdity of each most of them being in effect rather satires than compliment dryden calls a man he never beheld one of the best husbands living cibber has the artless inclination to be prodly glad and grateful about nothing at all mrs centlivre has the ambition to desire a nobleman of the sublimest wisdom who rules the fate of all europe will at a critical juncture receive favorably what she knows to be a weak performance fielding under a pretense of avoiding the usual style of dedication falls in the very next sentence into the grossest degree of the very fault which he reprobates poor lee who has indeed his bill of lunacy to plead calls himself the lowest creature in comparison of a lady who was more than charming seemingly adorable and very near divine while otway found out in his patron the duchess of portsmouth that her having been a prostitute to a king by whom she had a bastard was an illustrious transaction which no poet of any spirit ought to pass unsung  but in justice to some english writers i must not let this point go off thus ignominiously without producing for the sake of contrast a deserving imitation something on the opposite side where even a dedication appears amiable an address to the countess of albemarle from the polite sir richard steel opens in the following elegant and consistent manner  madam among the many novelties with which your ladyship a stranger in our nation is daily entertained you have not yet been made acquainted with the poetical english liberty the right of dedication which entitles us to a privilege of celebrating whatever for its native excellence is the just object of praise and is an ancient charter by which the muses have always a free access to the habitation of the graces in this passage we have at once etiquette and dignity  let it be compared with the trash which preceded one would indeed be apt to think the writers of that work meant to burlesque the thing the former examples look like so many mock dedications prosessedly of this kind the following is a specimen and the only one i recollect in our language  dedication to the right hon worthy and beautiful the lady   viscountess of   lady of the   and one of her majestys       madam i most humbly beg permission to throw this trifle at your ladyships feet and deeply conscious as i am of its unworthiness  of its inacuracy and of its incapacity to stand before so bright and penetrating an eye as your ladyships  i should not presume even to hope pardon for my temerity were i not consoled by reflecting that your taste infinite as it is meets a powerful competitor in the immensity of your goodnature but i have long wished an opportunity to approach so sacred and distinguished a character and i now come forwards on my knee with the profoundest humility of those creatures which form a part of my present subject as your illustrious birth defies the ambition of mere human words on the one hand so your unparalleled virtues annihilate the force of terrestrial compliments on the other i shall therefore on those heads observe a religious silence yet so far i must implore liberty of doing violence to your delicacy as to remark that you are at once the pattern and paragon of the age  that your beauty wit graces and taste are the envy of one sex as your judgment and genius are the astonishment and motives of despair in the other people of fashion in other ages have undoubtedly possessed some admirable qualities one woman may perhaps have been almost as handsome a second may have been almost as agreeable a a third may have possibly possessed equal sensibility and a fourth may have been nearly as liberal but the grand consolidation and concentration  the universal assemblage of bewitching accomplishments each collected together ray by ray and blazing to a point like a july sun was reserved for that curiosity of providence the amiable lady   i humbly implore forgiveness for this intrusion which i will only lengthen by beseeching your grace  i mean your ladyship  though a duchess you ought to be  will permit me to assure you  how sincerely i am and eternally will be your ladyships most obliged most obedient obsequious devoted slave and very zealous servant            liberal opinions vol i  which conduct shall we most reprobate they are equally contemptible the traffic should be regulated more consistently if men of genius must needs address their works to men of rank let them assert a more noble equality if they draw the portraits of any person remarkable for any thing let not a writer think he is more honored than he honors if he emblazons a name which was before glimmering in obscurity the obligation is to all intents and purposes on the side of the patron who but for such imputed excellence would have passed unobserved through life if he faithfully displays a character already much celebrated he is still a benefactor to that character if it were only for jogging the elbow of the public which but for such occasional mementos would soon forget the best and brightest man in the world  seriously were literary persons to act upon some such principle as this and show their patrons that the dealing was in point both of praise and profit entirely on the square it would check much of that assurance which is now indulged on the supposition that writers are to offer incense at the shrine of greatness or  in words more worthy so grovelling a subject to making the faggot blaze to gratify solly and then to be paid for burning the fingers as the pittance is dispensed by a taskmaster of much more service indeed would it be to genius science and general learning if their votaries were more inclined to cherish a spirit of intellectual independency  if instead of cringing to a courtier or running from the most fordid motives into panegerical hyperbole they were to assert their dignity and show the superior of this intellectual superiority we have the corroborating evidence of the incomparable voltaire in the following sentiments taken from his letters concerning the english nation the circumstance which mostly encourages the arts in england is the great veneration which is paid them the picture of the prime minister hangs over the chimney of his own closet but i have seen that of mr pope in twenty noblemens houses sir isaac newton was revered in his lifetime and had a due respect paid to him after his death the greatest men in the nation disputing who should have the honor of holding up his pall go into westminster abbey and you will find that what raises the admiration of the spectator is not the mausoleums of the english kings but the monuments which the gratitude of the nation has erected to perpetuate the memory of those illuistrious men who contributed to its glory we view their statues in that abbey in the same manner as those of sophocles plato and other immortal personages were viewed in athens and i am persuaded that the bare sight of those glorious monuments has fired more than one breast and been the occasion of their becoming great men voltaire luster of talents to the dullness of titles i say if a spirit of this kind were aroused it would soon restore to men of genius the original rights of literature at the same time that it would effectually crush that daring insolence which is now common among a set of people who pique themselves upon advantages which were the proper levelling power maintained would of itself by no means entitle them to equal honors  instead of this spirited conduct however we have the misfortune to perceive a style of baseness and adulation creep through most of the epistles dedicatory for the space of several centuries by which means flattery and fulsomeness is associated with the very idea of those addresses and the literary character is held by the dullest of the species in utter contempt  what hat undoubtedly contributed to bring about so disgraceful a circumstance is a custom which prevails amongst authors of swelling the ignorant vanity of patrons by submitting to them a performance prior to its entry into the public world this mode might indeed be reasonable enough were it only designed as a compliment to the taste of the patron which the authors may be supposed anxious to gratify before the matter becomes as it were public property but when it is done with a view of begging permission to say civil things of the patron and his family it degenerates into a meanness which justly merits the neglect that commonly attends it  ask permission for what for distinguishing a man for circulating the knowledge of his good qualities beyond the narrow circle of very likely a frivolous set of companions require leave to do this  was there ever heard such an inconsistency  the point is misconceived be it again remarked that in true science there is a greatness which can seldom receive though it may often confer obligations genius may more properly be said to patronize than be patronized  if a production is fit for the eye of men of taste it ought to be acceptable to men of rank who are ready enough to be thought in possession of a fine taste themselves and very frequently no doubt pay liberally for their dedications solely upon that principle  if on the other hand a performance is crude trifling illwritten and notwithstanding such defects is without the consent of the patron adorned with a name which it disgraces such patron ought publicly to renounce his protection and treat the pretender as every pretender of whatever profession deserves to be treated still however with this salvo that if the production could have done any service to literature or promoted but in a small degree the cause of science he would have been the first man to acknowledge his obligations for having been thought a fit patron to assist that cause and strengthen those services  while the present scandalous concessions remain the sneer will inevitably be thrown upon such abominable prostration i have been somewhat copious on this subject because it has never to my recollection been placed in a proper light  perhaps this doctrine of dedications may be little relished by those who are daily pampered into conceit by daily panegyric but it is a justice which every man of letters owes to a character founded on qualities which ought to be a better passport to honorary distinctions than any that can be conferred by royal grant or by the pride of ancestry  on such qualities was founded the reputation of david hume so that upon this occasion at least his example may be held up to persons engaged in literary pursuits as a proper standard  section iv of humes principles and his motive for making them public with some remarks on his conduct in his last moments but to go on with the moral character of david hume whoever places the writings of this philosopher beside those of many christian authors who have been much celebrated for them will be able to judge without prejudice it is impossible for the sentiments of the elegant tillotson or the orthodox addison to be more the champions of every part of conduct which tends to the welfare of the social world than those sentiments which are to be collected from hume  nay the most rational spirit of morality the most likely of all others in the world to affect this breathes ardently through all his philosophy elegance of taste chastity of sentiment delicacy of passion decency of manners love of truth command of passion cultivation of friendship and the good order and political prosperity of the state are every where recommended very few of our eminent writers on the opposite side of the question can say as much but with respect to mr hume every effort of his pen stands in testimony of it  these observations cannot nevertheless be called skeptical i do not nor shall i presume to say how far humes philosophy was right or erroneous in its principle sufficient for my purpose if i can convince any reader that might hesitate before of his consistency with himself a point which is of the utmost consequence to the cause of every system be its purport and its objects what they may  the science pursued with such vigorous curiosity by hume was to use his own expressions to know the different operations of the mind to separate them from each other to class them under their proper heads and to correct all that seeming disorder in which they lie involved when made the object of reflection and enquiry  it has generally been thought that our author carried this mental geography as he calls it too far into the realms of skepticism and into the abstruse bewildering deserts of unchearful metaphysics yet however ardent he was in speculations of this abstract and difficult nature no one will deny that he drew the form of virtue upon all occasions as the most lovely and estimable of all objects he firmly believed that in some very important respects truth was overwhelmed in error and superstition he was therefore sufficiently enterprizing to try if by the aids of application care art and discriminating accuracy he could not unite the boundaries of the different species of philosophy by reconciling profound enquiry with clearness and truth with novelty  this it is confessed was the labor of a long healthy and contemplative life he persisted in the pursuit in defiance of all opposing fatigues clamours oppositions neglects oppressions it could not be the love of an established literary same that urged him to the prosecution of such researches because he knew there was in his species of philosophy an abstractedness as well as a supposed spirit of fallacy which could not in the nature of things and certain prevailing modes become for many ages either a popular or a pleasing science it was to all intents and purposes  caviare to the multitude nay he was well persuaded of all this not only by the odium which was cast upon his treatise on human nature which fell dead born from the press but also from the following passage which shows how little hope he had of making the abstruse philosophy so generally relished as that which is more gay elegant and superficial nothing can be more useful says he than compositions of the easy style and manner which draw not too much from life require no deep application to be comprehended and send back the student among mankind full of noble sentiments and wise precepts applicable to every exigence of human life by means of such compositions virtue becomes amiable science agreeable company instructive and refinement entertaining  a philosopher of humes close and difficult reasoning who was hardy enough to scrutinize subjects imagined to puzzle more as they are more investigated  a man who had either patience or fortitude enough to cultivate metaphysical science with a determined view of overturning and eradicating root and branch prejudices which appeared to him at least to merit an analysis which should prove their futility  such a man could not expect the same eclat with the generality of mankind as those who only played prettily on the surface of a more easy and obvious philosophy hume contented himself with less general gratifications his own remarks very fully convince us what he felt what he expected and what he enjoyed on this subject  speaking of the common distaste to which men have for speculations that require thinking to comprehend them he has these sentiments in the first section of his enquiry concerning human understanding  but may we not hope that philosophy if cultivated with care and encouraged by the attention of the public ay carry its researches still farther and discover at least in some degree the secret springs and principles by which the human mind is actuated in its operations astronomers had long contented themselves with proving from the phenomenon the true motions order and magnitude of the heavenly bodies till a philosopher at last arose who seems from the happiest reasoning to have also determined the laws and forces by which the revolutions of the planets are governed and directed the like has been performed with regard to other parts of nature and there is no reason to despair of equal success in our enquiries concerning the mental powers and economy if prosecuted wlth equal capacity and caution it is probable that one operation and principle of the mind depends on another which again may be resolved into one more general and universal and how far these researches may possibly be carried it will be difficult for us before or even after a careful trial exactly to determine this is certain that attempts of this kind are every day made even by those who philosophize the most negligently and nothing can be more requisite than to enter upon the enterprise with thorough care and attention that if it lie within the compass of human understanding it may at last be happily achieved if not it may however be rejected with some confidence and security this last conclusion surely is not desirable nor ought it to be embraced too rashly for how much must we diminish from the beauty and value of this species of philosophy upon such a supposition moralists have hitherto been accustomed when they considered the vast multitude and diversity of actions that excite our approbation or dislike to search for some common principle on which this variety of sentiments might depend and though they have some times carried the matter too far by their passion for some one general principle it must however be confessed that they are excusable in expecting to find some general principles into which all the vices and virtues were justly to be resolved the like has been the endeavor of critics logicians and even politicians nor have their attempts been wholly unsuccessful though perhaps longer time greater accuracy and more ardent application may bring these sciences still nearer their perfection to throw up at once all pretensions of this kind may justly be deemed more rash precipitate and dogmatical than even the boldest and most affirmative philosophy which has ever attempted to impose its crude dictates and principles on mankind  what though these reasonings concerning human nature seem abstract and of difficult comprehension this affords no presumption of their falsehood on the contrary it seems impossible that what has hitherto escaped so many wise and profound philosophers can be very obvious and easy and whatever pains these researches may cost us we may think ourselves sufficiently rewarded not only in point of profit but of pleasure if by that means we can make any addition to our stock of knowledge in subjects of such unspeakable importance  but as we read mr humes life written by his own hand we shall have fresh opportunities to clear up any doubts that may remain of his sincerity it seems pretty evident that the little sketch called my own life was thought necessary by mr hume to be before hand with his philosophic antagonists whom he foresaw would raise new outcries against him upon the ideas they might indulge concerning those closing sensations which would attack him within fight of the grave to prevent little triumphs of this nature i say it is highly probable he chose the fairer method of being his own historian and never was there a biographical tract drawn up by any man in the highest health with more coolness more conciseness more impartiality  he sat down to this extraordinary employment and took up the pen exactly at the time that hundreds  i might i believe extend the number to thousands  were thinking he would begin the bitter groans of recantation i certainly shall not take upon me to say how far this employment was proper but the annals of the world cannot possibly produce any instance whereby philosophy became so much of a piece whatever were the singularities of that philosophy i once more insist upon it it was a strong evidence that he disdained any of the popular hypocrisy now in vogue he could not counterfeit the alterations which he did not feel risen in his mind he was calm enough to give a candid account of his literary life when he knew himself to be incurable  after he had written it he observes the same tranquil composure in regard to the nearer approaches of death nay such was his steadiness to the principles by which he was directed that in a codicil to his will he desired the narrative of his life might be prefixed to the next edition of his works  having finished the account of his life he had no farther opportunity to employ the pen except from time to time to send notes of information to the tender enquiries of his friends among the most beloved and distinguished of these appears to have been mr adam smith to whom two or three days before the stroke which carried him out of the world he sent the following letter  my dearest friend i am obliged to make use of my nephews hand in writing to you as i do not rise to day          i go very fast to decline and last night had a small fever which i hoped might put a quicker period to this tedious illness but unluckily it has in a great measure gone off i cannot submit to your coming over here on my account as it is possible for me to see you so small a part of the day but doctor black can better inform you concerning the degree of strength which may from time to time remain with me adieu etc   this letter may be brought by every man who wishes well to humes philosophy as another instance of that invariable congruity with which he maintained his character heroism on these occasions approaches for the most part so near to enthusiasm and that is so closely allied to absolute frenzy that i shall not hazard such an appellation i shall not say hume died like a hero i will content myself with saying that he died like a philosopher perhaps the word the best and exactest definition of the true as distinguishable from the adulterate on the one hand and the superficial philosopher on the other is defined by our author and discovers in a very precise and affirmative manner not only the thing itself but his own indefatigable character the other species of philosophers consider man in the light of a reasonable rather than an active being and endeavor to form his understanding more than cultivate his manners they regard human nature as a subject of speculation and with a narrow scrutiny examine it in order to find those principles which regulate our understanding excite our sentiments and make us approve or blame any particular object action or behavior they think it a reproach to all literature that philosophy should not yet have fixed beyond controversy the foundation of morals reasoning and criticism and should for ever talk of truth and falsehood vice and virtue beauty and deformity without being able to determine the source of these distinctions while they attempt this ardous task they are deterred by no difficulties but proceeding from particular instances to general principles they still push on their inquiries to principles more general and rest not satisfied till they arrive at those original principles by which in every science all human curiosity must be bounded though their speculations seem abstract and even unintelligible to common readers they aim at the approbation of the learned and the wise and think themselves sufficiently compensated for the labors of their whole lives if they can discover some hidden truths which may contribute to the instruction of posterity   philosophy has no very precise idea generally affixed to it because it has been much confounded with the pragmatical pretensions of the ignorant the affected and the superficial there is a true and a false philosopher mr hume is to be classed amongst the noblest of the former kind he founded his system upon thought science argument and reasonings which after many assiduous years remained in his mind the same neither could the dissipation of youth allure him from his favorite studies nor could the threats of dissolution itself frighten him from making preparations for a new edition of those works which were to destroy what he considered as the prevailing systems of superstition  in support of these observations we may very properly call in the letter of his dr black of edinburgh universally known beloved and admired as a friend a physician his chemical skill and as a man physician written the day after the decease of his patient  edinburgh monday   th august      dear sir yesterday about four oclock afternoon mr hume expired the near approach of his death became evident in the night between thursday and friday when his disease became excessive and soon weakened him so much that he could no longer rise out of his bed he continued to the last perfectly sensible and free from much pain or feelings of distress he never dropped the smallest expression of impatience but when he had occasion to speak to the people about him always did it with affection and tenderness i thought it improper to write to bring you over especially as i heard that he had dictated a letter to you desiring you not to come when he became very weak it cost him an effort to speak and he died in such a happy composure of mind that nothing could exceed it   who would not wish after reading this account that their end may be like his  section v parallel betwixt hume and lord chesterfield both with respect to abilities and principles we have now surveyed our object in the most trying moments  we have seen him superior to all ordinary terrors and equal to all occasions it is taken for granted therefore that as a philosopher both in precept and practice it will be allowed he was complete exact unchangeable  that whether wrong or right he acted immediately from his own bosom conviction a conviction grounded upon intense and abstract attention and not taken up suddenly without respect either to cause or to consequence thus far then the point is cleared before me but i cannot persuade myself to resign mr hume till i have done ampler justice to his memory and to that social and honest conduct which so much endears it  i would draw a slight parallel betwixt this gentlemen and another celebrated writer who descended into the tomb a little before him i would persuade the reader to compare with me the system of david hume and that of the late earl of chesterfield not with a view of proposing the former to his imitation  for that point should always be settled by a mans own mind after a great deal of premeditation upon the matter  but as it may serve to show what has indeed been a principal endeavor in these pages that it is possible even or skeptics to be more worthy members of society more reverend to a first cause whatever it may be and more essentially the friend thus it is more and more obvious that the desire of literary same had not the greatest share in prevailing with mr hume to persist in a philosophy little understood little liked and much disrelished by the most powerful bodies in the world to wit the superstitious and hypocritical he was therefore not only a consistent but an honest writer after he had tried the experiment with his unfortunate treatise and failed after he had in vain can anew the enquiry concerning human nature after he had published his moral and political essays with as little success after the appearance of his natural history of religion had met with a very cool reception after all these mortifications as he himself terms them after all these variety of winds and seasons to which his writings had been exposed with only those little gales of fugitive good fortune to console him the railing of doctor warburton and the illiberality of bishop hurd such was the force of his natural temper such his unsurmountable aversion to every thing but the pursuits of philosophy that we find by hi dying confession these disappointment made little or no impression on him i was ever more disposed says he to see the favorable than unfavourable side of things a turn of mind which it is more  to possess than to be born to an  of ten thousand a year  from these several circumstances nothing can be plainer than that he was a serious enquirer into the extent of the human understanding that he submitted patiently to  impediment that arose in the progress  so arduous and unpopular a contempla that he was neither attracted by same nor deterred by censure if he has too fully indulged his passion he did not err from any desire to deceive because he certainly hoped to extricate truth from obscurity and absurdity if he was too adventrous he had the singular merit of not expecting either reputation or fortune for his mistakes in one sentence to concenter the whole force of his apology by clearing him of the most universal crime of all ages  he was no hypocrite  violent verbal asseverations and religious tenacity of opinion are exceedingly suspicious to the judicious though they captivate and enthral the vulgar and simple i must once more advert to a horrid contradiction of the zealots  the little correspondence and indeed generally speaking the constant quarrelling there is betwixt their precept and practice well might hume observe that if we examime the lives of these men we should scarcely think that they reposed the smallest confidence in their pious protesations what cannot the delightful belief of an everprotecting real presence  cannot the charming hopes of omnipotent favor nor the merits of a savior nor the expectations of a blessed immortality infuse inter these sluggish religionists an emulative spirit to exceed the goodness and common conduct of men like david hume who believed all these fair prospects to be a riddle an aenigma an inexplicable mystery  shall the very sages of our church the examples and representatives of a redeemer be covetous vain dissolute voluptuous fraudulent abandoned while those who professedly fit loose to the letter of the law are by the settled force of mere philosophy temperate moderate sober what pretensions can men have to credit who belie themselves i still dispute not the propriety of the christian religion but i must be candid enough to confess i lay no great stress upon the manner of some of its followers  and yet they have modesty enough to be very angry if any one questions their sincerest pretensions   of mankind than the most illustrious persons who have never ventured so far into the recesses of enquiry lord chesterfield was a character more distinguished for the brilliancy of his wit than the solider powers of his understanding  in points of philosophy he was exceedingly superficial in politics he did not want sagacity or experience assisted however very much by the splendours of his title  for a little spark will make a large luster in a lord  he sustained his character with singular eclat and passed in the world which is very easily dazzled as a compound of elegance humor morality gaiety and patronage  these qualities in a certain degree we allow him to have possessed except one it certainly is not now necessary to observe that it is the word morality which must be scratched out of this list for many years however lord chesterfields morals were unsuspected at length too superficial to be consistent or perhaps weary of deceiving the world into notions of his plaindealing he condescended in the eve of life to show mankind what a bubble he had made of it how long and how successfully he had sported upon on its weaknesses  with how much case he had played the elegant trifler and by what modes and maneuvers he had with a facility which required no effort but a smooth face and pliable features led in victorious chains a thousand fools to the altars either of ridicule or debauchery or destruction  such were the principles such is the system of this distinguished hypocrite by the adoption of whose precepts it is utterly impossible either for youth or age wit or wisdom to escape every thing that is execrable contemptible and delusive the atheistical hume as some have called him was in comparison with chesterfield deserving of every epithet that could be formed in language to express virtue in his life writing and at his death he seems to have abhorred dissimulation and yet his company was not unacceptible to the young and careless as well as to the studious and literary nor had he any reason to complain of the reception he met from modest women in whose company he was particularly delighted he did not nevertheless profess a fondness for the society of modest women because it was safer to have an affair of gallantry with such than with a prostitute professed or because the connection was more elevated and consistent with the amors of a gentleman nor did he mix with the gay and careless with any latent design to take an advantage or the cheerful hour in order to make himself master of the secrets of the heart imparted in its fullness  and consequently master of the person to whom that entrapped heart had the misfortune to belong by no means  whatever objections may lie against the philosophy of hume none of them are of this nature since his most abstract researches were in favor of a behavior perfectly irreproachable  whoever is acquainted with mr humes writings will bear witness that he was a lover or decency order and decorum whoever knew the man can attest that the following passages are no wife exaggerated  i am says he or rather was for that is the style i must now use in speaking of myself which emboldens me the more to speak my sentiments i was i say a man of mild dispositions of command of temper of an open social and cheerful humor capable of attachment but little susceptible of enmity and of great moderation in all my passions even my love of literary same my ruling passion never soured my temper notwithstanding my frequent disappointments my company was not unacceptable to the young and careless as well as to the studious and literary and as i took a particular pleasure in the company of modest women i had no reason to be displeased with the reception i met with from them in a word though most men any wise eminent have found reason to complain of calumny i never was touched or even attacked by her baleful tooth and though i wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religions factions they seemed to be disarmed in my behalf of their wonted fury my friends never had occasion to vindicate any one circumstance of my character and conduct not but that  zealots we may well sup would have been glad to in and propagate any story to my advantage but they could never find any which they thought would wear the face of probability i cannot say there is no vanity in making this funeral oration of myself but i hope it is not a misplaced one and this is a matter of fact which is easily cleared and ascertained  to a character so amiable so complacent and so little tinctured by that pedantry which always sticks to an affected philosopher who that has any sense of agreeable qualities will ever bring near him such a frivolous compound of whim wickedneses cunning and congee as lord chesterfield unless indeed he is brought forward by way of contrast there appears likewise to me to have been as wide a difference in the size of their abilities as there was in the honesty of their principles every page in those letters which have laid open his lordships hypocrisy furnishes us with examples of his futility it would be the drudgery of a day to detect a single light sentence in hume the earl of chesterfields utmost stretch of penetration amounts to little more than shrewdness partly caught from the suggestions of a mind naturally suspicious and partly from observations upon the weaknesses and tender imperfections of men less capable to dissemble this faculty is at best but a principal ingredient in the character of a cunning fellow who as it were by imperceptible slight of hand has the art of appearing what he is not and of cheating you with singular dexterity even before your face  but all the same of popular etiquette that could possibly arise from such practices hume would have discarded with disdain and chiefly for two reasons first his genius had not a single grain of the petit maitre in it which by the way was a considerable ingredient in lord chesterfields and secondly he had too much dignity in his nature and too just a sense of the social compact between the individual and the whole human race to find any zest in gratifications which emanated from neither more nor less than flagrant treachery hence it appears obvious enough that the earl of chesterfields heart and head were both unable to bear any sort of parallel with the head and heart of david hume the one is the author of a system which seems to have been pillaged from the dancing master the perfumer and the devil the other pursues a philosophy which with all its exceptions gives countenance neither to the follies of a coxcomb nor the meanness and mischief of a hypocrite  a wretch which in the course of these pages has been marked with singular reprobation and above all other hypocrites one that ina kind of moral masquerade dress perpetrates every baseness and passes upon the world as a mighty good christian creature  section vi of proper cautions prior to the establishment of our religious credenda with regard to the skeptical doubts which might start into the philosophical and reasoning mind of mr hume it is i once more repeat no part of my office to defend or to censure them as a variety of men have employed their talents on one side of an important subject he has taken the liberty as a philosopher to offer his opinions on the other side considered in the light of speculation this is certainly fair for who can circumscribe the efforts of a mind bent for any length of time on one favorite point  the systems of either party however ought not to sway any man against the concurrence of his own reason for at that rate one might be a christian a deist a mohammedan or an atheist in obedience to the bidding of another by which means our religion would have more colors than the camelion and more alterations than proteus a sensible man will never have servility enough for this if he is yet unestablished in his more serious tenets he will see what can be said both for and against of opposite principles it is his business to fix upon those which appear the most congruous and probable reason indeed i know not why has long been unreasonably denied a proper exercise of her power in religious matters while faith is honored with the privilege of insisting upon implicit obedience yet the former is called the noblest faculty of human nature and the latter should certainly only be allowed to follow in the train the common argument is little more than this  you must believe because you must believe it is in vain to pretend any regard to probabilities or to urge against things sacred the convictions of close reasoning  reason is out of the question  is it not written in the book the question to be sure must not be answered but in one way you must have faith  now it appears to me that to call reason our sovereign distinction and yet reject its influence in points of eternal moment while we affect to observe its dictates in matters indifferent is just as rational as if we were to hold sacred and obligatory those edicts of parliament which regulate our more public spectacles  such as plays and puppetshews while we snap our fingers at the state and the personage who rules it whenever a mandate is issued for the good order and welfare of what is most important to the policy power or prosperity of nations this method of forcing any particular faith upon a man though it is aking an enemy by surprise is yet ridiculous enough in its nature to admit an illustration in the following passages from henry fieldings romance of joseph andrews mr barnabas was again sent for and with much difficulty prevailed on to make another visit as soon as he entered the room he told joseph he was come to pray by him and to prepare him for another world in the first place therefore he hoped he had repented of all his sins joseph answered he hoped he had but there was no one thing which he knew not whether he should call a sin if it was he feared he should die in the commission of it and that was the regret of parting with a young woman whom he loved as tenderly as he did his heartstrings barnabas bad him be assured that any repining at the divine will was one of the greatest sins he could commit that he ought to forget all carnal affections and think of better things joseph said that neither in this world nor the next he could forget his fanny and that the thought however grievous of parting from her for ever was not half so tormenting as the fear of what she would suffer when she knew his misfortune barnabas said that such fears argued a diffidence and despondence very criminal that he must divest himself of all human passion and fix his heart above joseph answered that was what he desired to do and should be obliged to him if he would enable him to accomplish  barnabas repliedthat must be done by grace joseph besought him to discover how he might attain it barnabas answered by prayer and faith he then questioned him concerning his forgiveness of the thieves joseph answered he feared that was more than he could do for nothing would give him more pleasure than to hear they were taken that cries barnabas is for the sake of justice yes said joseph but if i was to meet them again i am afraid i should attack them and kill them too if i could doubtless answered barnabas it is lawful to kill a thief but can you say you forgive them as a christian ought joseph desired to know what that forgiveness was that is answered barnabas to forgive them as  as  it is to forgive them as  in short it is to forgive them as a christian joseph replied he forgave them as much as he could well well said barnabas that will do he then demanded of him if he remembered any more sins unrepented of and if he did he desired him to make haste and repent of them as fast as he could that they might repeat over a few prayers together joseph answered he could not recollect any great crimes he had been guilty of and that thofe he had committed he was sincerely sorry for barnabas said that was enough and then proceeded to prayer with all the expedition he was master of some company then waiting for him below in the parlour where the ingredients for punch were all in readiness but no one would sqeeze the oranges till he came  i am afraid the arguments of mr barnabas are for the most part full as cogent as those which impose a system upon us without allowing us to consult the understanding  are they afraid we should refer to so sober an authority as reason is it for their interest to make us the mere tools of credulity is it political to beat us vi et armis into adoption of their favorite tenets such an assault upon vulgar timid minds may be very alarming but i confess i could never be inclined either to diesm mahomatism or christianity by compulsion the philosopher will so far at least be a free agent and like poor joseph believe as well and as much as he can   reason and his feelings may generally be trusted upon the occasion but let him not be hasty nor yet vibrate equipoisd too long between fluctuating sentiments fixing let him fix unless afterward upon very cautious and clear grounds he has weighty arguments to warrant an alteration if his intellect is found enough for science  shallow lowness is perilous in philosophy as well as learning  he can receive no injury from having heard both the pro and con the case of a judge upon a cause brings the matter home to the business and bosom more familiarly a magistrate is not qualified to decide of any point before him till witnesses on both sides are examined to these very often for conscience sake are added crossexaminations to see if the story told any other way has the same consistence and congruity the evidence once satisfactory to the senses of the judge and all doubt removed by several facts each agreeing with the other and all resolving themselves into an harmonious whole he proceeds without farther debate or delay to the final sentence which whether it dispenses life or death is given with the same firmness energy and resolution  similar to this should be the procedure of any person unestablished in his religious concerns it is too important an article to take up on mere trust a thinking man will not be a deist or a christian only because his father before him and all the other branches of his family were one of those he will look with an eye of penetration into the circumstances he will see why wherefore and upon what considerations this adopts christianity that deism he will compare one system to another examine their distinct parts and correspondencies  trace out the points where they separate where they blend in what they are utterly different and wherein in they are obviously or apparently analogous  when this sober task is diligently done let reason assert her dignity and having scrutinized liberally let her liberally determine to which ever side she inclines let it be upon the result of her conviction without paying any regard to passion or prejudice two mercenary counselors which in the court of moral arbitration are too apt to take bribes and turn the issue of the cause while they endeavor to blind the equity and discernment of the magistrate  aboe all other fatal things i warn you not to give implicit credit to great authorities which in religious cases are never to have an undue influence let not the force splendor or power of a name seduce or awe you into a partial choice religion like matrimony should be if possible settling for life let neither hume or addison or bacon or bolingbroke lock or tillotson sway you by any thing but the actual weight of arguments which strike eventually and irresistibly upon the rational faculty  these hints pursued will i cannot but believe serve in some degree every hesitating person and when carried into practice i have faith enough in them to conjecture they will enable every one who is pleased to lend them his attention to act honestly amiably uprightly and to discharge his duty according to the truth that is in him whether he be of one religion or another  of david hume or of his phisophy i shall say no more but from a succinct view of the whole matter i apprehend it may very fairly be concluded in repetition of mr smiths words that though men will no doubt judge variously of his philosophical opinions every one approving or condemning them according as they happen to coincide or disagree with his own yet concerning his character and conduct there can scarce be a difference of opinion  an address to one of the people called christians by way of reply to his letter to adam smith l l d on the life death and philosophy of his friend david hume esquire an address etc sir your very christian epistle wet from the clarendon press was brought to me by my bookseller just as i was correcting a proof sheet of that apology from the first advertisement of which in the newspapers you seem to have caught the hint of your title i mean so much of it as relates to the life death and philosophy of david hume esquire  upon showing my original titlepage the original title page printed in the london packet run thus an apology for the life death and philosophy of david hume etc to a learned acquaintance he said he discovered therein a visible impropriety an apology for the death for any man he thought unnecessary your letter convinces me the blunder would not have amounted to an iricism had it been admitted agreeable to my first design  since you have i find as many and as powerful objections to mr humes manner of dying as to his manner of living but your letter to dr smith is too singular not to command as much of my attention as can at this late period of my time when the apology is just stepping abroad be allowed  your epistle sir is the first of those  though i confess it came out rather sooner than i expected  which i prognosticated would be levelled both at david hume and dr smith it is certainly right that the people called christians should with all decent earnestness espouse the cause of that religion upon whose sacred foundations their faith is established i blame you not therefore  the more especially if you are of the holy order which i take to be the case  for drawing your weapon in behalf of what appears to you to be the only system that ought to be universally adopted it is laudable it is amiable it is noble but then it should have been done  a business so important  so delicate  should have been done sir without spleen without rancour without uncharitableness  has this been the case  the rage of a hurried composition is now gratified your zeal has almost kindled the wheels in its journey to london and you are perhaps  or you will be by the time this reaches you in your  i will not call it  easy chair  pray  reverend sir  you see i cannot help thinking i am addressing a clergyman though without your precaution i should have known you were not writing with the pen of a b   pray reverend sir let your pamphlet lie upon the table as you and i  with the pleasantry which i perceive is so dear to you  examine some of its paragraphs  your style is as you say  letter p   free and easy enough but neither in that nor in your sentiment do you appear to have in your composition any large proportion of that which our inimitable shakespeare styles letter p   the milk of human kindness and though it must be confessed you now and then are as you say ready to praise yet it is of that sort as if your spirit mocked itself or to apply another poetical expression which seems not to be illsuited  you damn with faint praise the other part of this memorable couplet must however be parodied to be apposite for your leer is by no means civil and you do sneer yourself most horribly even while you are teaching others to sneer   proceed we to the proof  it is with a very considerable share of prudence that you advise such readers as see advertisement to letter p i find no satisfaction in your book to throw it into the fire  i confess i was in the progress of the perusal more than once tempted to make a sacrifice of this nature and i more than once also heartily regretted the ditto p ii loss of my shilling and i shall certainly take care  advertisement p ii not to lose another in the same manner not sir because  see letter p   i am an enemy to human learning or that i could not have made a hearty meal upon a good fair and candid defense of christianity as yourself but because i cannot possibly consider as candid or fair or good a pamphlet which is written with an indecent degree of warmth and with very little regard to liberality what have you not upon the present occasion drolled upon  you have chosen to write your letter to dr smith in a droll way upon the most serious of all human subjects and yet you are very angry that our dying philosopher should in his last hours  see letter p  0 read lucian  play at whist and droll upon charon and his boat  i should not  i shall not sir  oppose mr humes philosophy to the principles of christianity  but i think it very hard that you should so entirely forget the christian temper the christian meekness and the christian charity which so eminently distinguished its divine master  nay you are deficient in the very liberality which should mark every fair and rational enquirer  is it liberal sir to turn the arrows of ridicule against a long life of  goodnature compassion generosity charity merely because his opinion happen to differ from yours  is that rectitude of conduct which confessedly marked mr hume to be dwindled down to nothing for the sake of supporting an argument on the opposite side of the question is it i say sir to be shunk into the idea of his being  letter p    good company and knew how to manage his cards  but almost every part of your letter to dr smith allows sufficient scope for the severest censure the witticism of turning mr humes history of england into a noble effort of letter p   matter and motion is wretched to pay you however a compliment in kind i must just express my notion that your pamphlet neither possesses such valuable matter nor do i think it will have by any means so noble a motion it will i trust like one of humes treatises fall dead born from the press and the amongst the things which are no more remembered although you have boastingly called it an ditto p    alarm bell to the admirers of mr hume yea even though you insist upon it  with a zeal which relishes more of bigotry than christianity  letter p    that it should be rung in their ears till succeeded by the last trumpet  the questions you address to dr smith are most of them exceedingly superficial the first is perfectly ridiculous why all this hurry and bustle to satisfy the public that our philosopher lived and died perfectly composed and easy was there say you any suspicion in scotland that he might not at times be quite so composed and easy as he should have been  and would you really have a serious answer to so silly a question pray sir was there ever yet a being so uniformly tranquil so perpetually serene as to be always the same and appear to his family to his friends and to his foes without some little discomposure if you speak in a religious sense i desire to know whether the firmest christian  to pay you the compliment  sir  whether you have not at times had upon you those feelings which have run counter to the general tenor of a more collected conduct and whether now and then you you have not been even in points of orthodoxy less composed and less easy than you could wish to have been the best men upon earth are in proportion to their sensibility the most susceptible of these occasional disorders nor can all the religion or fortitude or philosophy in the whole world prevent it  your second interrogatory and the third which is directly connected with the second are not more aptly proposed nor deserve they a more sober answer than the first  letter p    was there ever any book written against mr hume  which shook his system to pieces about his ears and reduced it to a heap of ruins the success and eclat of which might be supposed to have hurt his mind and to have affected his health was there any author whose name his friends never dared to mention before him and was not all strangers that were introduced to him against doing it because he never failed when by any accident it was done to fly out into a transport of passion and swearing or has no book been written to impair the growth and increase of his philosophic reputation  in reply to these several points i shall wave all stricture upon the scurility and unchristian spirit which is mixed up with them and only observe that no book has been written that has impaired humes philosophical reputation a philosophic reputation subsists only among philosophers and they to a man hold beatties book in contempt which is a philosophy calculated only for ladies and fine gentlemen  your arguments sir are not much happier than your questions as your remarks are in general poorer than both i shall expose the futility of these as their absurdity occurs to my mind upon a reexamination of your letter  what you have called a letter p    summary of mr humes doctrines metaphysical and moral is either a wilful or an ignorant misrepresentation of humes system which never in any one part or passage gave you first cause to say its author at any time letter p    sat down calmly and deliberately to obliterate from the hearts of the human species every trace of the knowledge of god and his dispensations much less did he endeavor to extirpate all hope of enjoying gods grace and favor on the contrary i do again insist that mr humes philosophical system inculcated every thing praiseworthy see apology sect   p  0         secondly sir you are upon a wrong ground in asserting that to want honesty and to want understanding and to want a leg are equally the objects of moral disapprobatian  this cannot be any part of david humes doctrine neither can bear critical examination in fact the most pitiable of all human objects is a dishonest reprobate for nothing can so truly be compassionated as a man who has not even policy enough to be honest yet he is certainly an object of moral disapprobation and though it may be very proper to pity him it is equally proper that for the sake of an example and for the service of mankind he should be punished a criminal pleaded upon his trial as an extenuation of his offense that he was predestined to commit it i am heartily sorry for that friend said the judge but by the same rule i am predestined to order you to be hanged breaking a leg is assuredly a pitiable circumstance but in point of culpability shall it be equally immoral with want of honesty nor did i ever know before that want of understanding was to be imputed to a man as criminal though it may sometimes be attributed to his weakness or want of application  again can a whole leg be called a corporcal virtue or can a broken one be termed with any propriety a corporeal vice corporeal virtues must be personal virtues such as charity cleanliness continence etc etc  there is something so unaccountable in this sentence sir that i should esteem myself very much obliged to you if you would intercede with your postscript to letter p    learned friend who drew up a comprehensive summary of humes doctrines to refer me to that passage in our philosophers works which treats of this matter  i beg references also by help of the same medium to those parts of hume which is you say letter p    designed to prove the souls mortality an attempt which i cannot with the closest attention perceive was ever made hints about his justification of selfmurder london review are as some critics have already observed candor itself requires we should not attack a work which the author himself had abandoned and in some measure reprobated  by way of contrast to the behavior of mr hume you lay before us for the choice of our adoption the behavior of hooker the christian  i am curious to know the reasons for proposing hooker as a contrast to hume  was there any thing in the conduct of their last moments which so materially distinguished them let us draw the curtain and observe  immediately before the author of the ecclesiastical polity expired he spoke thus  i have lived to see that this world is made up of perturbations and i have been long preparing to leave it and gathering comfort for the dreadful hour of making my account with god which i now apprehend to be near and though i have by his grace loved him in my youth and feared him in mine age and labored to have a conscience void of offense toward him and toward all men yet if thou lord should be extreme to mark what i have done amiss who can abide it and therefore where i have failed lord show mercy to me for i plead not my righteousness but the forgiveness of my unrighteousness through his merits who died to purchase pardon for penitent sinners and since i owe thee a death lord let it not be terrible and then take thine own time i submit to it let not mine o lord but thy will be done  god has heard my daily petitions for i am at peace with all men and he is at peace with me from such blessed assurance i feel that inward joy which this world can neither give nor take from me my conscience bears me this witness and this witness makes the thoughts of death joyful i could wish to live to do the church more service but cannot hope it for my days are past as a shadow that returns not  life p    when humes symptoms returned with violence upon him he from that moment gave up all thoughts of recovery and submited with the utmost cheerfulness and the most perfect resignation and complacency dr smiths letter p    he always talked of his approaching dissolution with great cheerfulness but never affected to make any parade of his magnanimity when even the conversation of his friends became oppressive and fatiguing he was quite free from dr smiths letter p    anxiety or impatience even the last stage of his disorder when it even cost him an effort to speak and when he had occasion to address the dr smiths letter p    people about him he always did it with affection and tenderness  after all this he died in such a happy composure of mind that nothing could exceed it  i look in vain for a distinct difference between the last moments of hume and hooker sir did hooker labor to be at peace with all men so did hume who had  dr smiths letter to mr strahan p    no enemies on which he wished to revenge himself did hooker live to see that  letter p    this world is made up of perturbations so did hume who  though the later period of his life was the most agreeable to him and though he saw many symptoms of his literary reputation breaking out at last with additional luster  considered that  life p    a man of sixtyfive by dying cuts off only a few years of infirmities insomuch that he declares almost with his dying breath that it would be difficult to be more detached from life than he was at that crisis  point out to me then i conjure you sir the superiority in the manner of hookers dying i own i cannot without some peculiar assistance find it out and i trust likewise that such readers of my apology as are neither  letter p   bigots enthusiasts nor enemies to human learning will be fully convinced that the influences of the philosophy which are the object of our present dispute were in no degree letter p  0 pestilential  from what has been already urged you will perceive sir that i by no means think that your letter to dr adam smith is it were no difficult matter to prove also that you have not written ingeniously several gross blunders which even hurry cannot excuse occurring in different parts of your pamphlet thus in advertisement p   you made your remarks because you thought them true what sir did you think them true before the thoughts were made p   of letter you use the word proportion for portion by which mistake the passage is truly ridiculous p   you say you never knew what hatred was no   what do not you hate vice and the villain good meek milkyminded man the friends of virtue and honesty are much obliged to you for that truly p  0 you talk facetiously of dying as insensibly and foolishly as you can for the life of you you say you are a south britain who would not have thought you were just exported from the banks of the shannon p    is the word yourself for the word you and various other errors  not of the press but  to adopt your own language   these are trifles my quarry lies not this way i fly at nobler game the atrocious cruelty of insisting that a writer diffused athoism who never did diffuse any such thing is a subject that concerns every body ingenuously written nor do i think the doctors deceased friend will very cordially accept services so maliciously offered even letter p  0 if as you cautiously observe departed spirits have any knowledge of what is passing upon earth  after all sir how can you allow your pen such a license  a license you would not dared to have indulged had the philosopher been in the land of the living  as to say that his existence was passed letter p    without god in the world though his notions of a supreme power might not perhaps directly tally with yours how are you able to tell that such a power did not as highly approve his arguments as your own would you pronounce a sentence of damnation against the indian for his worship to the sun  against the mohammedan for his homage to the prophet  against the chinese for his idolatry to a sculptured image  against the persian for his prostration to a cloud all these people have different ideas of a a deity from you  none of these are christians  millions of them believe letter p    nothing about the son  many of them are moral social pious humane charitable  shall they nevertheless not see life but shall the wrath of god so furiously denounced by st john abide on them  i am shocked at such a system yet the case is parallel fie upon it sir it is not the part of a christian pastor to be extreme to mark even what is done amiss nor is it characteristic either of a follower of jesus or of a servant of the eternal father to snatch from the hand of that father  essay on man  the balance or the rod  although you have taken upon you to rejudge his justice and be the god of god all that part of your letter therefore sir which would represent mr hume as unworthy the mercy or protection of a providence is arrogant insolent ignorant and presumptuous  but to say the truth and do you full justice you seem sir to prosess a notable talent for misrepresenting the sentiments of those whom you are pleased to censure i am sorry to find you do not think dr smiths good meaning will succeed because  without the least mixture of your beloved irony  i really think his design was perfectly laudable i see nothing wrong in his persuading us to follow the example of david hume because i perceive not a syllable that proposes atheism as a cordial for low spirits and the proper antidote against the fear of death if you perceive such sentiments i again repeat that it becomes you sir as a fairdealing christian who ought to do justice betwixt man and man to be more particular in your references and not to be laughing wild in merry madness  your smile of john the painter is very elevated indeed and soars superior to all reply i am not offended and accept very good humouredly your declaration of letter p   meaning no harm the misfortune is that i am afraid you will do no good your pamphlet like what you take to be mr humes definition of the soul  a thing by the bye which he never mentions  letter p    is not one but many things and being a jumble of many things together is ultimately nothing at all you more than once letter p    subvert your own hypothesis and prove by your ungracious manner of arguing that by such argument nothing can be proved  these sir among many other reasons induce me not to speak quite so advertisement to letter p   handsomely of you as i could wish and these are also my motives for refusing to introduce you to my kinsfolk and acquaintance  upon the whole sir after accurately examining your letter to dr smith and carefully reconsidering the whole subject of the preceding apology in cansequence of it i am able to conclude with an application of your own closing expressions and of my motto namely that  see advertisement p   on reviewing what i have written i really cannot see there is any occasion for me to alter or to add another sentence  for modes of faith let graceless zealots fight his cannot be wrong whose life is in the right consequently david humes system upon account of the rectitude of his life cannot be wrong  i am sir your humble servant one of the people who venerate sincerity  finis books printed for fielding and walker no  0
