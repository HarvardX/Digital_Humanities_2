irregular broad white stripe and a red eye beneath black brown and white  linn syst not p     p cx  the papilio iris is esteemed among the beautiful and placed with the rare of the english lepidoptera the cursory reader may not perceive that superiority particularly as many of the minute insects infinitely excel in real beauty and richness of coloring but the scientific will be ever ready to give it the first place as a british papilio and to those a figure of the caterpillar and chrysalis will be an acceptable acquisition it derives the title of purple high flyer as it very rarely descends to the ground except in some few instances it has never been taken but in the most elevated situations and even those instances have been after a strong wind or heavy rain the tops of the loftiest forest trees afford it an asylum and in the caterpillar and chrysalis state it is preserved from the wanton cruelty of man by the almost inaccessible height of its habitation they feed on the sallow salix caprea and the caterpillars are obtained by beating the branches of the tree with a pole twenty or thirty feet in length it is then but a necessary precaution to cover the ground beneath with large sheets to a certain distance or the insects which fall will be lost among the herbage  it is in caterpillar about may and june it passes to the chrysalis state and in july or august is a papilio  the great difficulty and trouble to rear the caterpillars when found and greater difficulty to take the fly has stamped a valuable consideration on it and particularly so when fine and a high price is but esteemed an adequate compensation for it if in good preservation the male is smaller but more beautiful than the female the upper side of the wings of the female not being enriched with that vivid change of purple which the male possesses in such an eminent degree but the underside of the female is far richer in the various teints of color than the male they are both beautifully spotted mottled and waved with brown black white and orange the chrysalis is of a very delicate texture much resembling thin white paper and is tinged in several parts with a very lively purple hue which it borrows from the wings of the enclosed insect and bears the characteristic mark of a papilio by being suspended from the tail with the head downward   plate xxxviii cimex stagnorum water bug hemiptera shells

belong to this extensive family the external appearance of the house or scarlet bug cannot intimate the connection to the same genus with this slender bodied insect but so they are arranged by linnaeus and so they will appear on a proper inspection of those parts which constitute their generic character  the present species is common and may be taken during great part of the warm seasons we have an insect of the same genus cimex lacustris which has frequently attracted notice by the variety and activity of its motions when sporting on the surface of stagnant pools or other standing water it appears to fly or skim the surface but its wings are not often expanded the lightness of its body and length of its legs permitting it to dart with great velocity in any direction and when it alights it causes only a gentle tremulous motion beneath it its habits have much affinity to the generality of aquatic insects and being constantly found on that element would almost determine it to be of that race but it is rather amphibious and very rarely descends beneath the surface it will at intervals rest for several minutes motionless on the water its six legs are then expanded and the tarsi of the feet only touch the surface but the cimex stagnorum is remarkable for the regularity and carefulness of all its actions it rarely runs but treads the water slow and ever appears to apprehend danger it frequently pauses suddenly and if it then perceives any thing disagreeable retires aquatic insects are generally supplied at several parts of their body with an oily matter that the water cannot penetrate and the legs of this insect is apparently possessed of that property   plate xxxix coccinella coleoptera generic character antennae knotted truncated palpi longer than the

the adult insect though its body js longer and tapering and it has no shells to defend it if in danger its security therefore depends on its feet which are rather longer or at least appear longer than in the afterstate all the species whether as the larva or the adult commonly feed on grass but they as frequently are taken on the plantain thistle and rose or any other plant whether wild or cultivated they fasten themselves to the leaves of any plant that is near when they enter the chrysalis state and its appearance is then as if it were tied to the leaf by threads which pass each other in transverse directions they remain only a few days in the chrysalis as it undergoes but little change may june and july or later if the weather should prove fine is the time to find them many of the species are so numerous in almost every situation that collectors give little trouble to obtain them or at least search for such only as are most uncommon   plate xl phalaena rosea red arches

appellation is derived they exist by rapine and plunder and support their infant offspring on the vitals of larger insects  the female ichneumon when ready to lay her eggs is seen eagerly rushing from one plant to another if its prey offers which is generally the larva of the phalaena papilio etc it darts down with the ferocity of an eagle and grasps the tender body in its claws it is now in vain that the unwieldy animal attempts resistance as all its efforts are but the sport of a savage conqueror for raising the body almost upright or into the form of a bow the creature returns it in an instant and dashes the sting up to the base in the softest part of the caterpillars body this if undisturbed it will repeat thirty or forty times always choosing a fresh spot for every new wound and often entirely scarifying the insect the stung animal refuses to eat and sometimes its illness terminates in its death though generally the eggs are matured and the insects produced from the living

and our present figure is of the larva of that insect we have before described it as a savage voracious creature in every state of its existence the larva which is an aquatic feeds on insects of that element and when it becomes adult moths butterflies and other winged insects are its prey as lepidopterous insects are not provided with any weapons defensive or offensive it will encounter the largest grasp them in its claws and tear them to pieces its mouth is spacious and well adapted for that purpose  the larvae of most winged insects pass to the aurelia or chrysalis state and thence produce the fly but the larvae of the libellulae never undergoes that change and though its appearance is altered several times in its progress to perfection it does not become dormant when the ultimate period of its last change arrives it crawls to the bank or side of the ditch and affixing its legs firmly to the ground or grass it collects all its strength and by one violent effort the future between the thorax and abdomen is broken whence the head and thorax is protruded after some pause the exuvia is cast off and the wings which were before enwrapped in the short cases at the bottom of the thorax expand the creature now entirely formed for flight only waits a short time to exhale the superfluous moisture and then rushes into the air to spread havoc and disorder   plate xlv

rotherhithe have been yet more productive we do not owever understand that any have been taken this season about the metropolis  the very singular manner in which this caterpillar constructs its web deserves particular notice previous to its transformation from the larva to the aurelia it quits the tender plants which afford nourishment and retires to those better calculated for its protection in its defenseless state its choice is generally the scirpus lacustris bull rush or the stoutest plant that is near if its leaves are rushy and strong its first process is to make a deep incision across the leaf which it effects with little labor as its mouth is well armed for the purpose the upper part of the leaf being thus deprived of its support instantly becomes dependent the caterpillar

and seldom attain a very extraordinary size the gardens are infested by species somewhat larger and more lively in their marks and teints but if we wish to trace the just gradations of the beauty or size of those detestable creatures the forests abound and will afford the highest gratification to the enquiries of the naturalist we have spiders purely white or white stained with a lovely green yellow marked with a vivid red purples shaded with the richest hues and the brightest browns bespangled with the utmost elegance and symmetry yet under those rich adornments which nature has so profusely bestowed on this complication of beauty and ferocity we discover inherent qualities which in larger animals would become formidable and though we feel confident of our superiority over the insidious art of such a contemptible creature yet the mind is susceptible of an inward abhorrence at its touch which neither the expansion of philosophy or ignorance of its disposition will sometimes suppress it is probable that thomson in his description of the spider felt this sympathy of the human mind   to heedless flies the window proves a constant death where gloomily retired the villain

places they are enclosed in webs of a white yellow or gray color varying according to the species immediately that the warmth of the sun has hatched them they disperse it being no longer necessary to live in societies which indeed would deprive some of their subsistence  in february we took a nest of minute yellowish eggs which proved to be the infant offspring of the a diadema they scarcely exceeded the size of a pins head when hatched and were of a bright yellow color at first their food was the common house fly but their increase in bulk was so rapid that it was necessary to destroy many to preserve a few we therefore selected four specimens which being fed in separate glasses and on different insects exhibited each a distinct degree of strength and color one specimen destroyed thirty of the common house fly in a day it then appeared much enlarged and the colors were almost black except the spots of white which sparkled with infinite luster but being confined a week without a fresh supply its colors were considerably faded another week of abstinence reduced its colors to a pale uniform brown the body was much wasted and the creature became perfectly ravenous it devoured a vast quantity of food and recovered much of its former colors a few hours after  our largest spiders are incomparable for their size or venomous qualities to the productions of america or of the eastern countries in germany they are far superior in size to our specimens but in surinam they are infinitely surpassed spiders of those parts being often found with legs as thick as a goosequill and three or four inches in length which with difficulty support a body as large as a pullets egg their snares are commonly extended from one branch of a tree to another covering the space of twenty or thirty feet and is sufficiently strong to entangle the largest insects a seba has figured a spider of this description as descending from an arm of a tree into the nest of a small species of humming bird to suck the blood of the parent and eggs  the eyes of the spider are a very beautiful microscopic object viewed either as transparent or opake they have generally eight two on the top of the head that look directly upwards two in the front a little below the foregoing to discover what passes before it and on each side a couple more one whereof points sideways forward the other sideways backward so that it can see almost all around it they are immovable and seem to be formed of a hard transparent horny substance the number of eyes is not the same in all the species of the spider they have eight legs with six joints thickly beset with hairs and terminating in two crooked moveable claws which have little teeth like a saw at a small distance from these claws but placed higher up is another somewhat like a cocks spur by the assistance of which it adheres to it is webs but the weapon wherewith it seizes and kills its prey is a pair of sharp crooked claws or forceps placed in the forepart of the head they can open or extend these pincers as occasion may require when undisturbed they suffer them to lie one upon another mr lewenhoeck says that each of these claws has a small aperture or slit through which he supposes a poisonous juice is injected into the wound it makes  the exuvia of the spider which may be found in cobwebs being transparent is an excellent object and the fangs or forceps may be easier separated from it and examined with more exactness than in a living spider the contexture of the spiders web and their manner of weaving them have been discovered by the microscope the spider is supplied with a large quantity of glutinous matter within it is body and five dugs or teats for spinning it into thread this substance when examined accurately will be found twisted into many coils of an agate color and which from its tenacity may be easily drawn out into threads the five teats are placed near the extremity of its tail from these the aforesaid substance proceeds it adheres to any thing it is pressed against and being drawn out hardens in the air the spider can contract or dilate at pleasure the orifices through which the threads are drawn the threads unite at a small distance from the body so that those which appear to us so fine and single are notwithstanding composed of five joined together and these are many times doubled when the

hid in that frothy matter which we find on the surface of plants it has an oblong obtuse body and a large head with small eyes the external wings for it has four are of a dusky brown color marked with two white spots the head is black the spume in which it is found wallowing is all of its own formation and very much resembles frothy spittle it proceeds from the vent of the animal and other parts of the body and if it be wiped away a new quantity will be quickly seen ejected from the little animals body within this spume it is seen in time to acquire four tubercles on its back wherein the wings are enclosed these bursting from a reptile it becomes a winged animal  the color of the winged insect is found to vary from a deep chocolate to a very pale brown it is taken in july and august  it

it apicella  wishing to comprise such information as may recommend our work to a general class of readers we are absolutely compelled to deviate from that uniform path which we at first intended to pursue by introducing the figures of some moths before we can procure their larva we promise this will rarely occur except with insects whose larva are unknown and the author will spare no expense or trouble to attain even those but were he to refuse a place to the many valuable specimens recently discovered it would be very displeasing to the greater part of his subscribers therefore as an invariable observance of such intention promises only to exclude the most rare of our insects we cannot always indulge it on this plan in the first volume we could neither have represented the phal batis peach blossom as the larva has only once been found or the phal christernana whose larva is unknown the caterpillars of a very small portion of minute moths are known and many species in the adult state are so very rare as to have escaped the attention of the most accurate entymologists of the number which are ascertained as natives very few are hitherto figured or even described  these are insects which few cabinets in england possess hence the figures must be very acceptable and their rarity a sufficient apology for their premature introduction   plate lviii fig i i phalaena

gray head and thorax white abdomen gray  we have copied the name pruniella from that celebrated work of clerk said to be executed under the immediate inspection of linnaeus himself he has figured it in the   th plate fig   but the great scarcity of that work there not being twelve copies in this country can have contributed in a very small measure to its being generally known which indeed is the fact as it does not appear any writer since that time has figured or even described it some were perhaps ignorant of its having been figured in clerks plates which however could not have been the case with linnaeus but we cannot find that he has described it or referred to clerks figure in any part of his works though a copy of that book came over with the linnaean collection into the hands of dr smith nor can we trace any description of this moth in the writings of fabricius he also has not quoted the figure we may hence conclude that although the insect is frequent in the months of june and july it is little known except with those who possess collections and even many of that description are perhaps unacquainted with the circumstance of its having been named by clerk and probably by no other author  taken at highgate  fig ii phalaena marginella lepidoptera generic character phalaena tinea  specific character first wings bright pale brown with a broad white margin second wings white  our present species was unknown to linnaeus but according to his definition of genera is one of the tineae it will be necessary however to distinguish it from the tinea marginella of fabricius which is a native of germany and altogether different that writer it is well known divided many of the genera of linnaeus and from their materials constituted an infinitely greater number it was by such divisions he separated the tineae into the genera tineae and alucitae removing the alucitae the insects distinguished by this title are known by the trivial names plumes or fans their wings being entirely formed of feathers connected only near the base in the manner of a fan of linnaeus under the title of pterophorus  he therefore uses the specific name marginella to his tinea and alucita our

the apex of the upper wings which appears like the feather of a peacocks tail the serruginous dorsal spot surrounded with a thick black mark although pretty is by no means peculiar to this species being common to several other minute moths the clouded markings of black and buffcolour interspersed with silver give this little animal a beautiful appearance particularly under the microscope the under wings have a similar appearance of a peacocks feather but more obsolete at the apex  we believe this species has never been described before and very rarely taken our specimen was found in

natural size with a microscopical representation not to enforce that such addition is indispensibly necessary but when moths like the present offer whose marks though beautiful appear confused it will

scattered upon the upper wing near the base the inferior wings are of a yellowishwhite with a shade of purple a dark spot on the middle and a pale black broad border with a white fringe  this elegant species of the noctua division of moths appears to be not only a nondescript but altogether unknown before even to the best practical entymologists that an insect of such magnitude should have been unnoticed by linnaeus or fabricius is not very singular as several nondescripts of a similar and many of an inferior size are to be seen in almost every cabinet but that the species should have escaped the researches of the most eminent collectors is rather astonishing  we have sought every information which our connection would permit and from the result we scarcely hesitate to pronounce

copied is in the collection of the author it was taken in a lane leading immediately from the wood at tottenham the last week in june      it was discovered in the evening on a blade of grass and from

appearance between the living and dead specimen of the same species is not peculiar to this insect only but is commonly observed of most other kinds the body is large in proportion to the other parts but after death it is so contracted or distorted from its natural shape as to assume the appearance of an incoherent mass the skin so corugated as to receive a false light on different parts of the surface and consequently the natural glow of the colors considerably decreased by the exhalation of that moisture which served to refresh them in the living state  the underside from the greater tenacity of the skin or shelly substance is less liable to alteration than the upper side it is entirely of a dark but beautiful purple which is changeable in proportion to the convexity of the body

of insects constitutes the most prominent character in this  of its use we are altogether ignorant as the various opinions that have been given by former writers are now obliterated some have supposed that they were the organs of hearing or smell and others have imagined that they were susceptible of the least motion in the ambient fluid in which they move  geoffroy discovered the organs of hearing in several amphibious animals viz in the toad frog viper some other serpents lizard watersalamander and skate memoires etrangers de lacad de paris       and many of the most eminent anatomists of the present time have discovered by their researches into the animal kingdom those organs in different creatures professor camper in      published remarks on the organs of hearing in fishes in the harlem transactions in the year      etc  mr hunter has described others in the philosophical transactions vol lxxii  and dr monro has described and figured great variety of them in his large work on the structure and physiology of fishes  probably induced by those discoveries professor fabricius endeavored to ascertain the organs of hearing in insects also and about nine years ago published an account of this interesting discovery in the new copenhagen transactions vol ii p      with figures of those organs in the crab and lobster he found the external orifice of the organ in these animals to be placed between the long and the short antennae the cochlea etc being lodged in the upper part which linnaeus calls the thorax near the base of the serrated projection at its apex we must therefore conclude that the antennae of insects are appropriated for some other purposes than those it is at present suspected they answer  the cerambyx aedilis fabricius informs us lives in the trunks of trees its horns are moveable as it can either direct them forward or support them in an erect position and when it sleeps it reclines them along its back it also reclines them when it walks quick or has to pass through a narrow track as the least resistance from any thing in its way would be very liable to injure or break them off  our specimen was taken in may  linnaean index to vol ii
