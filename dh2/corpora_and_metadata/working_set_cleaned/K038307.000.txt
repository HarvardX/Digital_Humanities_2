skinnerrow mdcclxxv  to the honorable mrs boscawen madam it seems somewhat extraordinary that although with persons of merit no virtue stands in higher estimation than the love of truth yet the surest

accomplishment which can justly entitle her to it  i am madam with great respect your most obedient and most humble servant h more bristol march        the argument among the great names which have done honor to antiquity in general and to the roman republic in particular that of marcus attilius regulus has by the general consent of all ages been considered as one of the most respectable since he not only sacrificed his labors his liberty and his life for the good of his country but by a greatness of soul almost peculiar to himself contrived to make his very misfortunes contribute to that glorious end  after the romans had met with various successes in the first punic war under the command of regulus victory at length declared for the opposite party the roman army was totally overthrown and regulus himself taken prisoner by xantippus a lacedoemonian general in the service of the carthaginians the victorious enemy exulting in so important a conquest kept him many years in close imprisonment and loaded him with the most cruel indignities they thought it was new in their power to make their own terms with rome and determined to send regulus thither with their ambassador to negotiate a peace or at least an exchange of captives thinking be would gladly persuade his countrymen to discontinue a war which necessarily prolonged his captivity they previously exacted from him an oath to return should his embassy prove unsuccessful at the same time giving him to understand that he must expect to suffer a cruel death if he failed in it this they artfully intimated as the strongest motive for him to leave no means unattempted to accomplish their purpose  at the unexpected arrival of this venerable hero the romans expressed the wildest transports of joy and would have submitted to almost any conditions to procure his enlargement but regulus so far from availing himself of his influence with the senate to obtain any personal advantages employed it to induce them to reject proposals so evidently tending to dishonor their country declaring his fixed resolution to return to bondage and death rather than violate his cath  he at last extorted from them their consent and departed amidst the tears of his family the importunities of his friends the applauses of the senate and the tumultuous opposition of the people and as a great poet of his own nation beautifully observes he embarked for carthage as calm and unconcerned as if on finishing the tedious lawsuits of his clients he was retiring to venarian fields or the sweet country of tarentum hor book iii ode     in the above and many other important particulars the author has paid the strictest regard to historical truth in some less essential points where she thought it would rather obstruct than advance her purpose she has ventured to deviate from it particularly in fixing the return of regulus to rome posterior to the death of his wife martia in this and in the general conduct of the story she has followed the italian poet metastasio in his opera of three acts of which she has given a free translation and made such additions as were necessary to form it into a tragedy of five acts  prologue by
