a pill to purge the dispensary doctors or a cure for the present state of physic the state of physic may be truly said to be sick and stand in need of the doctor i mean the cordial administration of the law to bring it out of its convulsive motions for the whole body is in such an uproar and confusion i know not how any particular member that has a dependence on the welfare of the whole should be able to perform his functions regularly i design therefore to state the case impartially betwixt the honest dispensary physicians as they are pleased to entitle themselves on the one part and the apothecarys advocates what the apothecaries themselves on the other part and propose a medium to reconcile both parties if possible the case stands thus several eminent members of the dispensary catalogue after many years diligence in hunting out business and getting little at last found it entirely fall into the hands of the younger fry began then to set upon a prospect how to employ themselves for finding they had began at the wrong end first they thought upon the design of erecting a laboratory to instruct themselves a little better in the materia medica which after many years observation they had at last picked up amongst the apothecaries a happy thought indeed after a hundred years study to hit upon the right at last and think upon doing something to be taken notice of after so long a time of being remarkably eminent for doing nothing that tended either to the improvement of real knowledge or the more effectual curing of diseases but now to show the world the college i mean the dispensary college was not much of their labor and rather than lie idle they would practice gratis they offered proposals to the apothecaries that if they would find medicines they would be so charitable as to prescribe to all the poor of the city of london indeed i think this was a little too hard upon the apothecaries for considering the physicians that made those proposals had little or nothing else to do it was not much out of their way but the apothecaries being to find all the materials and the  rightly that these mens bills would never answer the charge to them again very reasonably declined it well this would not do but having erected a laboratory they hit upon this design to enjoin all the community to subscribe for a dispensary as at first pretended only to supply the poor with good medicines at the prime cost though the apothecaries at their first proposal were to do it for nothing e now comes the the dissension of their own members for the learned part of their body very well understanding the materia medica and seeing through the shallow pretext of so mean a fraud to take apothecarys trade upon themselves straitways show their aversion to such a poor design veiled under the specious name of charity hence has arisen all those animosities and feuds so wittily burlesqud by a member of their own and now to revenge this mighty quarrel the authority of the college must be exercised upon every one that seem to discountenance this grand and laudable design i shall therefore here take occasion to observe how fitly qualified most of these worthy subscribers were for apothecaries what choice they made of operators and how their medicines were at first prepared in the first place i wonder to hear some of these men of late set up for great operators and can now tell in every coffeehouse how mithridate and diascordium is compounded when a few days ago they made many modest mistakes in simple waters nay in their own laboratory one that mounted the guard for that day lest there should be any minute difference in the composition had like to have sent for a consultation to the committee to distinguish betwixt liquorish and gentian if these be the men that are to regulate the practice of physic to inspect the apothecaries medicines nay to set up shops and dispense better medicines of their own making even the lord have mercy upon us i never thought these dispensary men were really in earnest before but that this was only done to bring the apothecaries to some reasonable compliance to take their submission and send em to their shops again but this is the ready way to make em all forsake their shops and sell their blue aprons to the dispensary doctors for one of the first operators these ingenious men employed in this great work was one that had been some time prentice to an apothecary of new castle upon tine who there are generally grocers as well as apothecaries but by the by observe all their skill in pharmacy has been learned from the apothecaries or their boys that instructed some of em to my knowledge where after some years experience in distilling of mint camomil and aniseed water he is at last advanced to the great trust of prime operator to the dispensary always observing he is under the care and management of the committee now i leave you to judge if the world must not needs be very well supplied when i shall tell you this country booby knew not the names form or figure of his utensils much less how to use them for by chance i happened to be present when a grave dispensary doctor and this philosopher by fire were hotly disputing which was the head and which the body of a cucurbit and how to hit the junctures close this occasioned me when the magisterial doctor was withdrawn to ask some few questions about the preparations of some medicines which i imagined they could not be without but i soon found the assuming operator who was not a little proud of his new title as ignorant as his master but i fear this will give so much offense that these gentlemen will never think i can have that respect for them as to offer any thing for their advantage but indeed they are mistaken and i think they have taken the wrong measures themselves either for promoting the honor or advantage of the faculty of physic for certainly nothing can tend so much to the interest and reputation of physic as a hearty union amongst the professors of it and such a right understanding amongst all those that profess any part of it that neither the physician may encroach upon the office and particular duty of the surgeon or apothecary or either of them upon the physicians or each others proper business but that every one of em act distinctly in his own sphere and not endeavor to usurp the practice of one another but instead of all this every one of these   distinct bodies have promiscuously interferd with each others business and so at last brought a confusion and controversy in the profession therefore it ought to be inquired into who were the first aggressors and  dly what remedy ought to be taken to cure this growing evil both to themselves and the whole nation and first of all i think it highly unreasonable that the college of physicians should have any such power in them to censure and condemn the other two bodies of surgery and pharmacy or that they should have a power to practice all the parts of physic and to vend medicines since there are two bodies likewise incorporated as well as themselves to exercise the particular parts of surgery and pharmacy for i think it the highest injustice to make em a body politic and afterward restrain em to the jurisdiction of another since the incorporating of any persons is with design to bring em under the limitation only of their own laws and government therefore we are to enquire who were the first aggressors i cannot but think it was and is always the apothecarys interest to call in a physician to the patient as soon as he can and therefore why he should err in this i cannot understand besides if it was not always his interest it would be his safety because then the care of the patient lies wholly on the physician and the miscarriage ought to be imputed to him but when the apothecary meet with poor patients he must either advice him something himself or else he must have nothing because most of the physicians and especially of late will not take the trouble to prescribe and give advice gratis and so they may thank themselves but therefore to take off this objection the college set up the dispensary as a pretense to assist the poor when before they sold medicines it was difficult to get any of em upon request to give any advice without such fees as poor people could not give then the continual threats and trouble and suits at law they have put several of the apothecaries to is a very great reason why the apothecaries have been necessitated to make the best advantage they could of their business and the permission the college have given to quacks and others that daily vend medicines to the great detriment of the apothecaries while on the other hand they unjustly and contrary to all right and reason prosecute the graduate physicians of our own universities upon pretense of an act of parliament that never had the royal assent to it nor can it be reasonably supposed it should since there is no respect had of the privileges of our own universities which yet never was unexcepted before and i hope those two learned bodies will take care to vindicate and assert their own rights against a monopoly of a few men i call em so because the greater part and those men of the best business will never consent to their unreasonable proceedings therefore to remedy this there is only this way left viz to petition the next sessions of parliament either to explain the acts of parliament granted already in behalf of the faculty and to restrain all their illegal practices or else to grant leave to bring in a bill for the regulation and better establishin the practice of physic wherein every distinct body should have their privileges free to themselves and the exortances of the college practices taken away so that the should have no power to oppress others nor want any power to vindicate themselves and such laws as should not be detrimental to the privileges of the universities and first that none should be permitted to be members o he college of physicians but drs of our own universities awfully create and made  dly that all should have equal right to enter themselves in the college so qualified without the hindrance of the rest and last of all to be all of one denomination and community and admit none as licentiates in discouragement to all university education that none of this body should be permitted to practice surgery or compound or sell medicines nor practice manmidwifry that the surgeons be governed by their own laws and not subject to the college nor be permitted to give any physic inwardly except the pox alone but that they buy all their medicines of the apothecaries and that severe penalties be inflicted on em for doing the contrary that the apothecaries shall not administer physic inwardly or outwardly by bills as a physician or practice any part of surgery but that all medicines be rated by the laws of their own corporation and tables hung up in every shop and that they be no ways subject to the physicians or surgeons but act separately by themselves  note i would have the reader observe i am no interested man to any party but am for the college when they act like men of learning and honesty and against em when they expose themselves to the world as men of neither conscience nor honor  again i am no advocate for the apothecaries or surns but have a desire that the faculty may flourish d that no one party may be oppressed by the injustice  arbitrary proceedings of any of the others and to at end i write this sheet to stir up all persons that ave a concern or interest in the welfare of the pratice of physic that they may endeavor their utmost to ocure such wholesome laws as may establish the practice of physic upon a better foundation that it may he both more serviceable to the public and more advantageous to the faculty of physic and every particular person that have their dependence thereon  finis london printed for the author
