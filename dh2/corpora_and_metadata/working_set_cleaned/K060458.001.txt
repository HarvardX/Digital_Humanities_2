the history of lady barton  vol i  the history of lady barton a novel in letters  by mrs griffith  in three volumes  vol i  quibus pretium faceret ipsa fragilitas plin de crystallo london printed for t davies in russel street covent garden and t cadell in the strand mdcclxxi  preface works of this kind are in general of so captivating a nature to young readers that let them run through but a few pages of almost any novel and they will feel their affections or curiosity so interested either in the characters or the events that it is with difficulty they can be diverted to any other study or amusement till they have got to the end of the story  from the experience then of this species of attraction such sort of writings may be rendered by good and ingenious authors extremely serviceable to morals and other useful purposes of life  place the magnet low and it will degrade our sentiments hold it high and it elevates them imitation is natural to the human mind and as we copy those patterns best which we are most conversant with it depends upon the choice that parents and preceptors make of such compositions to produce the best effect from this general sympathy  tell me your company is a just adage but tell me your studies is as true a maxim  in the selection of proper pieces to assist toward so pleasing a method of instruction no inconsiderable part of the attention ought to be paid to the style and language of the writers for it is certain that those who can best express their sentiments are those who conceive them best and the same idea delivered by a gentleman will have double the effect to what it would have if uttered by his valet de chamber  all authors therefore of mean or illiberal education or stationed below the familiar converse of polite life should be wholly excluded from the sort of library i am here recommending nor should any translations be admitted there though done from the originals by the best hands according to the phrase of their title pages  for there is a stiffness in the style of all the publications of this kind i have ever met with that constrains the ease and freedom of our language and impures it with a number of gallicisms italianisms etc which even those who are allowed to be the best hands that have ever condescended to so servile an office find it impossible to avoid a work framed from ones own ideas is like learning to write from a copy a translation is like tracing the letters after the master has penciled them for us  if i have had any success in this or my former work of the same kind the delicate distress  it is owing more to accident than genius and may therefore be deemed rather fortunate than meritorious i have had a good deal of acquaintance with the world and have known many private memoirs and particular circumstances in life which has afforded me an opportunity of supplying both my characters and situations from the living drama instead of borrowing them from the mimic scene i felt as i wrote and lived along the line from the sympathy of friendship or the tenderness of compassion this is contagious  i hope my readers may catch the infection also  for i shall think myself extremely happy if i can in any degree contribute toward forming or informing the young and innocent the task of reforming i leave to greater geniuses and abler pens the characters which present themselves in this work are as i have already hinted mostly drawn from real life they are therefore natural and proper objects either for imitation or avoidance  virtuous and vicious every man must be  few in the extreme but all in the degree   but when writers exceed the bounds of probability and describe an angel or a devil in human form our reason is shocked and revolts at the idea of a character so much above or below our nature the semblance of truth vanishes the readers attention becomes relaxed and both the events and the moral if there should be any  fade like the baseless fabric of a vision  nor leave a wreck behind   with such productions our circulating libraries those slopshops in literature abound and with them must they still be filled till our legislature shall think proper to enable the booksellers to pay for better works by passing an act to secure their property in the copies they purchase till that is done no person in the trade can afford to pay a large sum for any manuscript be the merit of it what it will and of course no authors except the very poor ones indeed both in the literal and metaphorical sense of the word or the rich who form but a small squadron in the host of writers will devote their time and labor to the public without hope of some adequate reward  those who amongst our legions neither want nor abound have therefore but one way of contributing their mite to the parnassian treasury that of publishing by subscription which in my estimation is at once both flattering and humiliating as it proves the attachment of our friends while it lays us under the painful necessity of taxing their regard  happy and honored as i have been by the favor of the public in general as well as by the kind partiality of my particular friends i shall ever be both proud and pleased to offer my present and future efforts to their indulgent candor upon any terms and to subscribe myself their  much obliged most grateful and obedient servant e g

history of lady barton letter i lady barton to miss cleveland bangor ferry  remote unfriended melancholy slow  where mountains rise and where rude waters flow  where ever i go whatever realms i see  my heart untravelled fondly turns to thee  still to my fanny turns with ceaseless pain  and drags at each remove a lengthening chain how much am i indebted to the author of these beautiful lines for having expressed my present feelings so much better than i could myself the address was originally made to a brother there can therefore be no impropriety in applying them to a sister  and such a one as mine   you desired me my fanny to write to you from every stage  this is the first moment i have had to myself  one of sir williams most favorite maxims is that women should be treated like state criminals and utterly debarred the use of pen and ink  he says that those who are fond of scribbling are never good for any thing else that female friendship is a jest and that we only correspond or converse with our own sex for the sake of indulging ourselves in talking of the other  why sir william why will you discover such illiberal sentiments to one who has been so lately prevailed upon to pronounce those awful words love honor and obey the fulfilling the two first articles of this solemn engagement must depend upon yourself the latter only rests on me and i will most sanctimoniously perform my part of the covenant  yes my sister i will stifle the rising sigh and wipe away the wayward tear that steals involuntarily down my cheek from the fond recollection of those dear friends that i have left behind me would to nature that the objects necessarily followed their affections or else retained them with themselves instead of suffering remembrance like a tyrant to pursue the unhappy traveller adding anxiety to fatigue and grief to danger  sir william has met with some gentlemen of his acquaintance here he presented them to me and i could see that he seemed pleased at that sort of approbation which is expressed by looks at first sight of a person who happens to please us  there would be something flattering in this idea which i should wish to cherish if i did not fear that his pleasure arose more from vanity than affection  yet why should i think so has he not pursued me with unabated ardour near two years and triumphed over the repeated refusals of my friends and self by the most obstinate perseverance but might not vanity  be still thou restless busy perturbed spirit and no longer seek to investigate an humiliating cause for an event which is irrevocably past  these gentlemen then that i told you of are to join company with us for the remainder of our journey and voyage  there is one of them a lord something i forgot his title who is just returned from making the grande tour his person is elegant i think him both in face and figure vastly like colonel stanford  i suppose this young nobleman will be the bon ton of this winter in dublin it may therefore be of some use to a stranger as i shall be to be known to him i shall not however cultivate the present opportunity as i have left the room determined not to return on pretense of a headache in order to tell my dear fanny what she already knows that i am her more than sister her affectionate and faithful friend  louisa barton ps love to my brother and to my dear mary granville but i charge you not to show my letters even to either of them    letter ii lady barton to miss cleveland holyhead will you not doubt my veracity fanny when i tell you that three days spent in this dullest and most disagreeable of villages have not appeared tedious to me there is certainly a wonderful charm in variety of situations  every change produces a new assemblage of ideas and actuates the mind with curiosity comparison and inquiry  the wildness or even horror of this place for we have had a perpetual storm is so strongly contrasted with the mild scenes of cleveland hall or indeed any other part of england that i have seen that one would scarce think it possible for a few days journey to transport us into such extremes of the sublime and beautiful   i am persuaded that all the inhabitants of wales must be romantic  there never was any place appeared so like enchanted ground and the scenes shift upon you almost as quick as in a pantomime  from the stupendous bleak and barren hills of cambria you are almost instantly transported into fertile and laughing valleys  there never was a richer and more beautiful view than that of the vale of cluyd  i am not at at all surprised that poetry took its rise in this part of britain the ancient druids could not be at a loss for poetic images  every object they saw must have inspired them and exceeded both in beauty and wildness whatever sportive fancy could have invented or creative genius drawn forth from the storehouse of imagination  i think that even i seem to be possessed with a kind of poetic rapture while i describe these charming scenes but i will not anticipate the pleasure that i hope you will yourself receive from them next summer though i already forestall the much higher delight i shall feel on seeing my dear fanny at southfield  sir william has been in great spirits ever since we have been here and highly pleased at a very trifling mark of my obedience  he proposed riding out the morning after we came and though there was a high wind and a drizzling rain i made not the least objection to mounting one of the little welsh palfreys and clambering up the hills at his request  our fellow travelers lord lucan and colonel walter accompanied us  i have described the former to you  the latter is remarkably handsome but with a peculiar expression in his countenance which is not the result of his features but seems to arise from the predominancy of a particular passion in his mind  in short it is that sort of expression which has made you and me dislike so many handsome men  the colonel is to be our neighbor in the country he is now going to ireland to take possession of his estate and a seat in parliament for a borough he never saw  i am no politician or i should animadvert a little upon this subject this selfsame colonel has just tapped at my door to tell me that the wind veers a little and that sir william desires i will hold myself in readiness to embark i obey adieu my fanny  louisa barton ps i forgot to tell you that lord lucan was at paris when we were there last year  he has made me smile two or three times by his pathetic manner of lamenting his not knowing me then i tell him that he may date his acquaintance from what era he pleases as our living together in an inn has brought on a greater intimacy in four days than almost as many years could have effected in the usual course of meeting at operas routes etc but he sighs out a rueful o que non and the colonel laughs to show his white teeth and superior understanding   i come sir william adieu adieu     letter iii lady barton to miss cleveland dublin what scenes of distress have i gone through since i concluded my last letter to my dear fanny we embarked aboard the pacquetboat with what they called a shifting gale and to do the captain justice he was unwilling to sail but sir william and colonel walter were both impatient and their impetuosity as it generally does triumphed over our calmer reason   we had not been three hours at sea before there arose so violent a storm that the captain said it was impossible for the ship to weather it six hours he was however mistaken for it continued six and thirty  during which time we had been driven upon the northern coast of ireland and it was then to be feared that we should beat to pieces on the rocks there was a great number of passengers on board and their groans and lamentations would have affected me extremely in any other situation but the violent and continued sickness which i suffered rendered me insensible even to my own danger nor did i feel the smallest emotion when lord lucan who had seldom left my bedside caught hold of my hand with a degree of wildness and pressing it to his lips said we must perish  but we shall die together  the captain had fired guns of distress upon our approaching the shore and a fishing boat came to our relief into which the passengers crowded so fast that the gentlemen were obliged to draw their swords to prevent their sinking it how i got into the boat i know not but i found myself there rolled up in lord lucans rocquelaure and my head supported by sir williams knee  there were two other ladies in the boat with us the youngest of whom a miss leister seemed to be if possible worse than i  but i will not detain you longer in this scene of horror where we expected to be swallowed up by the waves that came rolling on us like moving mountains every moment till we reached the shore   behold us then landed upon what may almost be called a desert island for it is entirely surrounded by an arm of the sea and uninhabited by every thing but a few goats and some fishermen who are almost as wild as they  it was about four of clock in the morning when we arrived at this dismal place and such a morning for darkness rain and wind i never saw  neither miss leister nor i could stand much less walk and the gentlemen were obliged to carry us in their arms by turns for near two miles  till we arrived at some of the huts where the hospitable cottagers received us with that sort of surprise which i imagine we should feel if an order of higher beings were to descend by miracle to visit us  but be their kindness never forgot by me and may their beds of straw and smoaky rafters yield them such soft and balmy sleep as they afforded to my harrassed frame and let them never envy those that toss on down  i did not wake till near ten in the morning which was then as mild as it had been tempestuous when i retired to rest lord lucan and miss leister were seated on a little bank withoutside the door of the cottage where i slept to prevent any person from disturbing me as soon as they heard me move miss leister came to offer her assistance in dressing me  she smiling said that breakfast was prepared for me in a large drawing room and under the finest canopy she had ever seen then led me by the hand to the bank where she had been sitting  i was surprised to see tea there which though made in wooden vessels appeared to me more delicious than any that i had ever drank out of the finest dresden china   lord lucan told me that sir william the rest of the gentlemen and mrs layton who is miss leisters aunt were gone to reconnoitre la carte du pai de la terre inconnue ou nons etions  and that now he had seen me so happily recovered he would try to join them   i found that another boat had arrived from the ship and that our servants and a part of our baggage were come  when my poor benson saw me she cried for joy and indeed nothing but the state of insensibility in which i quitted the vessel could have made me leave her behind   upon enquiring we were told that there were neither horses or carriages of any kind to be had to convey us out of the island but that we might cross in a boat to a piece of land that lay opposite to one side of it which when we reached was eight miles from any town or village as soon as i had changed my clothes miss leister and i set out to meet or overtake our company to confer about the difficulties of our sad situation  i will bring you acquainted with miss leisler in my next letter and for the present i will call her lucy for i am sure i shall love her and in that case i hate the formality of miss   suppose us now to have walked about a mile and a half without discovering any object but the sea which surrounded us when to our great delight we spied land though still divided from us by a gulf we thought impassable we stood however on the shore inventing a thousand impracticable schemes to cross this tremendous hellespont but never once thought of the only possible one though we had been told of it we at last grew weary of indulging our visions and lucy who i find is extremely romantic said that were she in my situation she could with the utmost pleasure think of passing her days on the spot we were thrown on for that the constant presence of the beloved object must render any place an eden to her  i told her that if we were fated to remain there that either lord lucan or colonel walter would i hoped make this spot a paradise to her on her own plan she wiped away a starting tear and said that was impossible   at that instant a new object roused our attention we perceived a gentleman well mounted and attended by a couple of servants on the opposite shore lucy put up a most fervent ejaculation that he might have knighterrantry enough to cross the river and rescue us from our melancholy situation her prayer was heard  he swam his horse across the flood and lucy called him a second leander he came up to us with infinite politeness and address and told us that the mail which had been put on shore with us had been forwarded to his father who was the next justice of peace and lived about twelve miles from thence that by that means he became acquainted with our distress and had sent his carriage as far as the roads were passable with a number of saddle horses to bring us to his house  i confess i was charmed with this instance of hospitality and generosity i hope i should have been as much pleased with it had i only heard it related without having benefited by it  there is nothing affects my heart so much as benevolent actions i will flatter myself that this is owing to a natural sympathy  we made all the acknowledgments that our joy would permit and walked or rather ran back to our cottage with the stranger where we met our company and many more of the passengers who had come in the second boat from the ship   mr mathewess servants were by this time come up to us and opened two large baskets of provisions cold meats wine tea etc every person seemed surprised and overjoyed while universal gladness diffused itself through our little colony  lucy appeared almost frantic with delight  the common occurrences of life appear like enchantment to some minds  but there was an elegant simplicity mingled with her transports that rendered them extremely pleasing   i have now my dearest fanny delivered you from the painful anxiety you must have suffered from the first part of my letter my next i hope shall transport you to more pleasing scenes in the mean time rest assured that through every change of circumstance or situation i shall remain unalterably yours  l barton i long to hear from you pray tell me have you heard from the continent and how and where lord hume now is    letter iv lady barton to miss cleveland for the present i will continue my letters journalwise as miss byron sir charles grandison calls it but i cannot for my life be circumstantial and carry you up and down stairs to the parlour the drawing room the harpsicord the cardtable etc etc etc  suppose us then to have crossed the so much dreaded arm of the sea with some difficulty and less danger that we have performed our twelve miles journey through rugged roads and over hills and dales and are at last safely arrived at mr mathewess very handsome seat welcomed by him and his lady and a very numerous family of sons and daughters grown up to men and womens estate  on our entrance we were shown into a room where there was a table laid with all kinds of breakfasts that could be pleasing or necessary to the sick or healthful appetite and were informed that there were beds prepared for any of the company who might require rest after their fatigue this offer was declined by us all for the present but the whole company which amounted to eighteen ladies and gentlemen besides servants accepted mr mathewess invitation to spend that day and night at his house except colonel walter who said he would go on to newry the next great town and send us carriages from thence   from the first notion that you could conceive of our generous hosts you must believe that we were politely and elegantly entertained but neither your idea nor my description can do justice to their hospitality they have given me the most favorable impressions of this country on my first entering it but even sir william who is partial to his native land says i am not to expect a whole nation of such  fools i think he said  heigh ho this is my only comment   the manners and behavior of this worthy and amiable family were expressive of the sincerest pleasure at having had it in their power to relieve our distress  may they or theirs never know any lucy was in raptures with the young ladies both she and i flatter ourselves with a prospect of much pleasure from a future intimacy with mrs mathewes and her daughters  next morning our carriages a coach and four and several postchaises arrived and we took a grateful and affectionate leave of our kind hosts our journey had nothing remarkable in it except colonel walters waiting for us at the first stage we came to which considering the hurry he affected when he left us was rather an overstrained piece of politeness arising i imagine from a supposition that his company was of some consequence to the party  and perhaps he is not mistaken  lucys aunt mrs layton a good agreeable and well jointured relict about six and thirty seems to admire him much  she speaks italian badly  he is master of the language and she is for ever applying to him to correct her pronounciation  who knows but he may find pleasure in instructing so hopeful a pupil   the colonel is what is called a womans man he has lived a good deal abroad and has a superficial knowledge of almost every science  his head may be aptly enough compared to the drawer of a ladys writing cable which contains a little of every thing  i have this moment looked into mine to see if the allusion is just its contents are a miniature picture of sir william with a slight crack in the enamel and the catch that fastens the bracelet broken  my housekeepers accounts  a little billet from lucy  a french song that the colonel gave me  some scented sealing wax  writing paper  message cards  and a pocket book with scissars penknife pencil blank leaves etc  i do really think that this farrago of materials conveys a very expressive image of what i would describe  i hope you will think so too and henceforward acknowledge the colonel as an acquaintance   i promised in my last to give you a sketch of my lucy but i find i am not equal to the task for even in her outward appearance there is a variability that renders it almost impossible to draw an exact resemblance of her at some times you would think that her form and face were designed to personify vivacity   dip in the rainbow trick her off in air   at other times a soft melancholy usurps the place of gaiety so that at different aeras she may pass alternately for a melpomene or a thalia the muses of tragedy and comedy  yet she is agreeable under both these characters and i by no means think her temper changeable but am rather inclined though sorry to believe that these transitions are rather the effect of peculiar circumstances than natural constitution   i know she is in love  but i should suppose that to be rather a consistent passion where the flame is mutual and i should be tempted almost to despise her or any other woman in the world who continued still to love without sympathy  for true love is a passion of that extraordinary nature as some author has well expressed it that it requires the felicity of two persons to render one happy  without being positively handsome the men all like her she has good eyes hair and teeth a lively though not a fine complexion and a form that may justly be styled elegant though small   and now my dear fanny let me speak of and to yourself it is above a month since i left london i have been a fortnight in dublin and have not received a single line from you or any of the other dear friends i parted from in doverstreet  they tell me something about contrary winds  for my own peace i will believe them but if i am to remain in this island much longer under such suspense i shall be tempted to sell my jewels and send the money to lapland to purchase i know not whether it is to be an easterly or a westerly wind  but it shall be a fair gale to waft your letters to me  for the story of aeolus and ulysses you know is quite an arrant fiction  your impatient but truly affectionate louisa barton  letter v miss cleveland to lady barton doverstreet i received my dear sisters two letters from wales together and am pleased to find that you illustrate your own remark on the good effects which change of objects produce upon our minds i have always thought that in the separation of two persons who love each other the one who is left is by far the greatest sufferer the mind in spite of us must necessarily in some degree accompany or rather attend upon the body and while that is in motion it feels a kind of rotation also   beaux banish beaux and coaches coaches drive and now i talk of coaches i have never set my foot in ours since you left london i begin to think that this is carrying the idea of locality too far and will therefore order it to set me down at the playhouse this evening  your description of southbritain has increased my curiosity but not my desire of traveling through it  for what can augment my wishes to see you your first letter affected me extremely  oh beware of a propensity to unhappiness my much loved sister sir william has a roughness in his manner which i really believe to be more owing to an illiberal education than a coarse mind  i say illiberal though i know he was bred at a college  learning and science may be there acquired but alas i fear the professors of universities do not attend much to les petites morales  there are many men weak enough to imagine that an affectation of contempt for the understandings of women is proof sufficient of the superiority of their own  but these persons ought never to marry for we can neither love those we despise nor those who seem to despise us  but i am far from imagining this to be sir williams case i know he both loves and esteems my louisa though he be deficient in that sort of galant address which might better enable him to show his sentiments  but how few husbands are there after all even in what is styled polite life who seem to think such an attention necessary i affirm it to be absolutely so  for they must be sad philosophers indeed who mistake the possession of a treasure for the enjoyment of it but i will not forgive your trifling with your own happiness by seeming to doubt a fact on which alone it can be founded  i am glad you have happened to meet with the gentlemen you mention  agreeable society is always pleasing to a rational mind but more particularly so when there is any little difficulty danger or fatigue to encounter and notwithing your flourishing description of wales i cannot help thinking that a journey through it must be attended in some degree with those slight evils i have mentioned   my brother has been remarkably grave ever since you left us but i will not flatter you by imputing his reserve entirely to your absence  his delia his beloved miss colville is going to france with her ridiculous mother  and ill used as my sensible brother has been by that absurd widow i have no doubt but he will be weak enough to follow her daughter there and leave poor solitary me to pass the winter tout seul in doverstreet  i have told him and i really believe it that mrs colville has no exception either to his person rank or fortune though she will never consent to his marrying her daughter but i am persuaded that she would most readily accept of him herself  sir george cannot help smiling when i talk in this strain though he affects to be displeased at what he calls my folly  i know you will expect that i should say something of myself  alas louisa my history like poor violas twelfth night is a blank i have not received a line from lord hume since i saw you my apprehensions for his health and safety are however relieved by a letter his sister had from him dated at sienna a few days ago   i will believe for his sake as well as my own that he has written to me  a letter may miscarry i have often heard that the posts upon the continent are not so regular as ours  i will believe any thing but  that he has forgotten me  is this philosophy or vanity and is my opinion of his constancy founded on his merits or my own i ask questions without wishing to have them resolved  adieu my only confidante my much loved sister  adieu f cleveland ps sir georges best affections along with mine wait on sir william and our dear louisa mary granville is at bath with her aunt    letter vi miss cleveland to lady barton london why surely my dear louisa you intend to publish your travels and to push madame de scuderi from the shelf she has so long usurped in a lady library  what a sweet romance is yours what hairbreadth escapes what amazing perils by sea and by land what imminent danger of passing your life on a desolate island which by the way would i fear had you remained there have become a dissolute one for i dont find that you had a parson among ye and i have doubts whether the colonel and the widow would have waited till another shipwreck might have sent you a jonas  as to lucy and lord lucan to be sure they would have remained in a state of perfect purity and sir william and you are already joined in the holy bands of matrimony  so that upon a fair calculation i do not think that your community would have been worse than the rest of this habitable globe for one couple of delinquents in three is as little as can be expected even in the island of saints ireland so styled by the ancients of which you are happily now become an inhabitant or in the territories of his holiness the pope where all should be perfect  but a truce with badinage and be assured my dear sister that i felt for your distresses and sincerely rejoice at your safe arrival in dublin i both love and admire though not without a little mixture of envy your generous hosts what extreme pleasure must they have received from such a noble exercise of their benevolence and hospitality  all girls build castles mine have been always situated on a seacoast and in them have i often received shipwrecked princesses and drowning heroes i have chafed their temples and rubbed their hands for whole hours and when my great care and humanity have brought them back to this world of woes they have repaid my pains by a faithful recital of their doleful adventures  i once fell in love with a man i never saw for the same sentiment triumvirate chap xciii  i did not then imagine i should ever have so near and dear a connection as my louisa involved in the reality of such a dreadful situation and now may heaven be praised for my loved sisters preservation  i like your description of the colonel much  one knows abundance of table drawers though not all as well furnished as yours  but i do not much like the character  smatterers in science are generally triflers in every thing  that same want of stability which prevents their being master of any art like a shake in marble runs through the whole block and lessens the value of every part  i should not like such a man either as a friend or lover though he may perhaps be an agreeable acquaintance  i am much more charmed with your lucy your little pocket iris i hope she always wears changeable silks and alters them from grave to gay according to the complexion of the day  i did not mean to rhyme as you may see by my mode of writing  i agree with you that those transitions you mention may possibly be owing rather to particular circumstances than a peculiar inconsistency of mind  the latter would render her contemptible the former entitles her to our tenderness and love i think even from the slight account you have given of her there must be a charming frankness in her manner which is one of the first qualities i would seek for in a friend life is not long enough but were i an antediluvian i should not think it worth while to seek for a heart that is wrapped up in a hundred and fifty envelopes  un coeur serre would disgust me though the possessor of it had ten thousand amiable qualities  i think that your misfortunes with regard to the storm like most other disasters have been productive of some good by bringing you acquainted with miss leister  but what have you done with lord lucan when the pencil and pallet were in your hands why lay them by without giving a sketch of him i should fancy from his rueful o que non that there were traits of character sufficient to mark him by  if so i desire you will resume your new calling and let me have a full length of his lordship by the next post  sir george as i guessed actually intends to set out for paris in a fortnight  i am strongly tempted to accompany him louisa  i should then be on the same continent nay perhaps in the same city with lord hume for as his route is not absolutely determined i think it is most likely that he will pass the winter in paris as i know it is his favorite city  but then  may not my delicacy be wounded by its being said or even thought that i pursued him thither and to what end if his heart as i much fear be already estranged will my presence recall it ah no to what then should i expose myself to be slighted by the man i love  o never never in woods and deserts let me rather dwell and hide my woes in solitude   i now wish i had gone with you to ireland  and yet i should not choose to be farther removed from that blessed spot where ere it be for at present i know not that holds my happiness  perhaps my misery how can you say louisa that love is a consistent passion alas you know it not ten thousand contradictory wishes are born and perish in my mind in the same moment  and yet there was a time when you my sister used to blame my calmness and upbraid me with having too much philosophy  where is that calmness that philosophy fled to now oh let me once more woo them to my breast and be what i then was your happy as well as affectionate sister  f cleveland ps you will perceive by this long epistle that i have received both your letters from dublin  i do not my dear expect two for one but the first came last night when i happened to be out and the last arrived this morning  you may also perceive i began my letter with an affected gayete de coeur and ended it in real sadness  i had determined not to mention lord hume but my brothers coming into my dressing room and telling me of his going to paris threw me off my guard  excuse my weakness my loved my dear louisa    letter vii lady barton to miss cleveland dublin indeed my dear fanny your last letter has hurt me sensibly  i cannot express the tender concern i feel for your sufferings  yet with that frankness we both so much admire i will confess that i am on this occasion conscious of the force of rochfaucaults selfish maxim in the distresses of our best friends we find something that does not displease us horrid adage yet how true when i cannot help rejoicing that i have never felt the passion of love in the extreme that you seem to do  i have ever thought that love like friendship could only be founded on the amiable qualities of its object and that with them it must because it ought decay  how often have you and i laughed at the persevering passion of miss b  when we knew that lord m  despised her  but the little tyrant has taken ample vengeance upon you  heaven shield me from his resentment  i am however far from doubting lord humes constancy or love to my sweet fanny and my opinion is founded on your charms rather than his merits  yet grant him to be all you can wish surely it is a miserable state to have our happiness so totally dependent upon any human being that our not hearing from them for a few days or weeks shall render us totally wretched and create such a fever in the mind as you describe and i tremble at heavens what a wretch should i be were i possessed of this tormenting passion i am certain sir william has no more idea of it than of a sixth sense  how would the roughness and asperity of his manners which are now scarce sufferable then wound me to the heart  rejoice with me my fanny  at what not at my want of sensibility for sure i think not even you have more  and can i be delighted then at not having found in sir william an object to awaken it o no i fear i ought rather to lament than exult in my present torpid state  but still i have a subject for my tenderness my much loved dearest sister come to me then my fanny and i will soothe your sorrow will listen to your soft complainings and share each pang that wounds your gentle heart  i was alarmed at the first part of your last letter your treating the distresses i went through ludicrously was not like my fanny and when we stray so far out of ourselves there must be some particular cause which we would wish to conceal that occasions our acting or speaking out of character  you were unhappy and did not wish that i should know it but let not even that sort of pious fraud be ever practiced between us more  you may write freely your letters are sacred no eye but my own will ever see them sir william is satisfied with our correspondence and says he is sure we shall both be tired of it in three months  i will venture to say he is mistaken in us both   and so my brother is a stricken deer also and is setting off on a wildgoose chase after miss colville surely two victims to love in one family are quite sufficient and don cupid will i flatter myself let the third go free   fantastic tyrant of the amorous heart  how hard thy yoke how cruel is thy dart  those scape thy anger who refuse thy sway  and those are punished most who most obey   for heavens sake fanny if you have not by this time received a volume of billet doux from lord hume get up your spirits break at once into open rebellion against him and the little purblind deity fly to me and try whether an hibernian swain cannot make you amends for his loss  i am persuaded that it is possible to shake off an ill placed affection but i am afraid by saying so i may offend you however i shall let the sentiment pass since it is written and you are welcome to make as free with it as you please and perhaps may say with the philosopher boil that to undertake the cure of a lover is perhaps the next weakness to that of being one  i perceive myself falling into the very error which i reprehend in you that of affecting to treat your distresses lightly but believe me my fanny that i lay a restraint on myself in doing so and feel them not the less  cheerfulness and dissipation are the only remedies for a wounded mind and if i can make you smile even at my folly my end will be answered  you will i dare say discover that this letter has been written at different aeras  morning visitors are a pest that rages in all cities but is i think more violent here than in any place i ever was in except bath  there is some excuse for this intemperate desire of gadding there as the use of the waters forbids all sedentaty amusements and a game of neighbor i am come to torment you may be conducive to health  but here without temptation or excuse the ladies make it a rule to pass their mornings in any ones house but their own and would almost persuade one that they can neither read write work houswife or pray   exclusive of this grand mal i like the people and country extremely  there is an air of freedom cheerfulness and affability that runs through all the better sort of men and women and inclines you to like them even at first sight rien qui gene rien serre  we may be allowed to speak of a people in this language who seem to resemble the french more than any of their nearer neighbors  the old irish families style themselves milesians from milesius a spaniard who brought over a colony of his countrymen to people the island  but i should think from their manners as i hinted at before that they were originally derived rather from the french  i hate all national reflections but they seem not to have any thing of the spanish character among them  the court which is called the castle here is extremely agreeable as well as brilliant both in beauty and finery  it abounds particularly with the former  i think i never saw so many handsome women together in any place as i have seen here on a ball night  beauty is not however so general in this kingdom as in england it is chiefly confined to the higher ranks of life while there i have observed that it was most frequently met with in the middling and lower classes   i have run this letter into such an extravagant length that though i am very well inclined to proceed in the picturesque style and give you an idea of lord lucan en gros which is certainly as much as i can venture to pretend to at present i find my paper has circumscribed me within the limits of the smallest miniature and as my art cannot yet rise to the nicer touches requisite to that small scale i shall begin his portrait on a new sheet next post in the mean time this will barely allow me to assure you that my affection and tenderness are if possible increased by the unhappiness of my ever dear fanny  louisa barton miss leister is highly pleased with the title you have given her and says she will charge all her poetic swains to celebrate her henceforward by the name of iris    letter viii miss cleveland to lady barton my dear louisas agreeable melange gave me infinite pleasure as i am very certain it is an exact representation of her soft yet lively mind  i am sorry the gloomy picture i sent of my own affected you even transiently  lovers my dear are a strange inconsistent race of mortals their pains and pleasures so totally dependant upon trifling accidents and yet so exquisite that they are scarcely to be considered as rational beings  you who are not of the sighing tribe will be amazed when i tell you that at the time i received the effusions of your sympathetic tenderness i had almost forgotten the source of my own distress and could have cried out with orestes i never was unhappy   after this i think i need not tell you that i had just then received a letter from lord hume he is well and kind my sister but alas he talks of spending three years on his tour  we are both young it is certain but three years are three centuries in a lovers calendar  and should he hold his purpose i should fancy myself old as a sybil or as cybele before that time may elapse   though i detest the maxim you have quoted from rochfoucault i do not blame you for rejoicing in your own ease and tranquillity but you surely might do so though i were not in love  and yet perhaps the idea of your own felicity would not have struck you so strongly if you had not then thought me miserable they say it is in sickness that health is only valued i fear there is a certain perverseness in human nature that enhances the value of every blessing from the privation of it  i had conceived an idea here but fear i have not sufficiently expressed it but what i mean is that as a friend is a second self you have had the happy occasion of comparing the good and ill together without the sad experience of the latter  you see i am becoming a philosopher again  but alas louisa my philosophy is literally the sport of chance for i confess that the only happiness i am at present capable of enjoying is absolutely dependant on winds tides postboys and a thousand other wayward contingencies  i very sincerely join with you in wishing since you have not yet that you may never feel the passion of love in an extreme degree for i am firmly persuaded that it does not contribute much to the happiness of the female world  and yet louisa i will frankly tell you that i am extremely grieved at some hints you have dropped in your letters which speak a want of affection for sir william  it is dangerous to sport with such sentiments you should not suffer them to dwell even upon your own mind much less express them to others  we ought not be too strict in analyzing the characters of those we wish to love  if we once come to habituate ourselves to thinking of their faults it insensibly lessens the person in our esteem and saps the foundation of our happiness with our love   i am perfectly convinced that you have fallen into this error from want of reflection and through what is called une maniere de parler for i will not suppose that my louisa though persuaded by her friends and solicited most earnestly by sir william gave him her hand without feeling in her heart that preference for his person and esteem for his character which is the surest basis for a permanent and tender affection   i almost condemn myself for the severity of this stricture but my louisas happiness is of too much consequence to mine to pass over an error that may destroy it unnoticed before she is aware we are all wiser for others than ourselves but let this pretense to sagacity be pardoned by an elder sister as proceeding from the tenderest affection of here is  most truly f cleveland ps sir george holds his purpose and sets out in two days  i shall not accompany him nor can i at present accept of your kind and soothing invitation i mean that in the first part of your letter  i abominate your volatile idea of an hibernian or any other swain as a remedy for hapless love  adieu my louisa and forgive me the matronly airs i have assumed in this letter for i shall think myself extremely happy if in the future correspondence of our lives i do not make you more than amends by affording you in your turn many opportunities of appearing as much wiser than i as you are in reality     letter ix lady barton to miss cleveland indeed my fanny i rejoice in your happiness though i cannot help feeling that i am a sufferer by it for if you had not received a very kind letter from lord hume you would not in all probability have had spirits sufficient to have written an unkind one to me  you are my dear sister perfectly acquainted with every sentiment of my heart therefore to repeat what you already know is needless but in my own justification i must hold up a portrait to your view which from a very short absence you seem to have forgotten  by the loss of the best of parents i became my own mistress before i was seventeen  my brother who is three years elder than i was then returned from the university and set out almost immediately on his travels i then looked up to him as the sole stay both of your youth and mine and though my fathers indulgence had rendered us all independent of each other i firmly resolved never to marry without the consent and approbation of sir george   young as you were you may remember that during the time we passed at my aunt marriots in wiltshire there were several proposals of marriage made to me and among the rest sir william offered me his hand but as my heart was by no means engaged by any of the persons who honored me with their addresses i adhered to my first plan and referred them all to my brothers decision  as there had been no time fixed for sir georges return most of those who called themselves my lovers withdrew  but sir william either more enamoured or more artful than the rest set out immediately for naples where my brother then was and by conciliating his esteem obtained his consent which he pretended was all that was wanting to complete his happiness   when my brother wrote to us to meet him at paris i was transported at the thoughts of seeing him after a two years absence but did not once reflect upon his motive for sending for us nor did i even know that sir william barton was to be one of the party  sir williams galantry in coming from paris to meet us at dover flattered my vanity i will cnfess the continuance of his assiduities during our stay in france confirmed my brothers opinion of his passion for me  but alas i was still incapable of making any other return to his attentions than what mere politeness exacted from me  how often have my brother sir william and you seemed to doubt my sincerity when i have declared i knew not what love was and o how fatal has that inexperience been to my peace since yes fanny your sister is a wretch and gave away her hand before she knew she had a heart to transfer   yet this i am convinced of that had sir william persevered perhaps a few months longer in wishing still to obtain that heart it might i doubt not have been all his own but can it now bestow itself unsought and trembling yield to harshness and unkindness impossible the little rebel owns as yet no lord and it may breck but it will never bow beneath a tyrants frown  there never was any persons behavior so altered as sir williams  i perceived a visible change in his manners before we left london but it has gone on in a blessed gradation ever since and is at length arrived at the ne plus ultra of matrimonial disgust  i shall tell you a short story by way of instancing the uncouthness of my present situation with regard to him  sir william is naturally humane at least he used to seem so  i was applied to by a wretched family tenants of his own who had lost their entire substance by fire  i immediately took ten guineas out of my purse to pay my charity when he with the most supercilious air imaginable took hold of my hand bid me put up my money and not meddle with matters that i did not understand  said i was rather too young for a lady bountiful yet and that if i went on at that rate they would fire every cottage on his lands and he should be run into a goal by my generosity i stood amazed at this harangue  however i obeyed my husband by putting up the money but made benson convey it to the poor sufferers as from a third person while they with transports of gratitude acknowleged their having received twenty pounds from sir william though forbidden to reveal his bounty to his steward or any of his family on pain of his displeasure  now prythee tell me fanny if you do not consider this as an instance of a peculiar sort of perverseness why should he wish to restrain me from the virtuous pleasure of bestowing charity or endeavor to persuade me that he was totally devoid of it himself chide me no longer my sister for what is much more my misfortune than my fault  and what a misfortune at my time of life to look forward to a length of years that must necessarily pass away  joyless loveless unindeared may you be happier far dissipation must now be my resource it is all that i have left  what a slight and worthless counterpoise for domestic felicity  i will change the subject we are to spend the christmas at southfield  lord lucan colonel walter and my lucy are to accompany us  next to yourself she is the most agreeable companion i could have met with  her mind is as delicate as her form  and i can see that she is frequently hurt at the roughness of sir williams manners though she takes infinite pains to conceal her feelings from me on such occasions  i once wished that colonel walter would have fallen in love with her that i might have had the happiness of her living near me in the country but i am now convinced that they were not formed to make each other happy and that she would have refused him had he been an emperor  she has made me her confidante  she loves and is beloved by one of the most charming men in the world yet the odds are many against their ever being united  i often tell her i envy her situation for surely there is something infinitely delightful in suffering for or with an amiable person whom we love  it almost equals the happiness of sharing their good fortune  i am sorry i did not sketch out lord lucans portrait while i was in the vein but he is now so much altered that my former idea of him would bear no resemblance to what he appears at present  from the extreme of gaiety he is fallen into a profound gravity and sometimes appears gloomy and distrait  it is impossible to account for this change as he is much liked and admired by every one who knows him and i cannot conceive him to be in love as he is hardly ever absent from our coterie and i have never observed the least particularity in his behavior or address to any member of it though there are a number of pretty and agreeable women in our circle  the colonel perceives the alteration as well as i and seems to hint as if his sagacity could discover the cause of it but i have never given him the least encouragement to reveal his friends secret and i almost hate him for affecting to triumph over him  i have another reason for disliking the colonel which i will not at present communicate even to you  he continues to court mrs layton but i will not take upon me to say they will be married though i am sure it would make her very miserable to doubt it  there is an orphan niece of sir williams a very lovely girl at a boarding school here  i have endeavored to prevail on him to let her live with us  she is near fifteen which in my mind renders her present situation extremely improper and indeed i have a particular dislike to a boardingschool education for girls at any age as they must necessarily contract from it two qualities that i detest formality and insincerity  harriet westly has just written to her uncle to second my request and he has complied with it though in his ungracious manner by adding an observation by way of codicil to his consent that two women in a house are two too many   perhaps sir william only meant to be witty and not illnatured  a play upon words is apt to dazzle those who cannot play with them  i am glad colonel walter was not by when this ingenious remark was made as he seems to take a particular pleasure in repeating sir williams bon mots   as the scene i am engaged in is not extremely active my dear fanny must be contented with letting me fill my paper with such trivial and domestic occurrences as may arise from day to day nor must she expect order or connection in any of my letters  i write at every leisure moment and am perhaps interrupted ten times in the filling of a page  you are very differently situated mistress of your leisure and yourself and i cannot forgive your barely mentioning events in which you know i am extremely interested as they relate to a brother and a sister whom i can never cease to love and therefore i can readily pardon your reprehending the weakness the indiscretion  call it any thing but a fault of your affectionate  louisa barton ps i know not whether i told you before that lord hume and lord lucan are intimately acquainted    letter x miss cleveland to lady barton believe me my ever dear louisa when i tell you that my heart feels at this moment the tenderest sympathy with yours and most truly resents the unhappiness of your situation i will chide no more my sister but henceforward endeavor to sooth those sorrows which i cannot cure  dissipation as you say must be your course any thing is better than brooding over irremediable evils yet great are the hazards which a young and beautiful married woman has to run who enters too deeply into a life of gaiety  the grave part of the world will censure her conduct as arising from the levity of her mind and the dissolute will form schemes for the destruction of that innocence which is the only true foundation and support of cheerfulness or vivacity   beware of artful men my dear sister i cannot help it i will tell you all my sears they may be nay i hope they are quite vain but i will confess i do not like your intimacy either with lord lucan or colonel walter  i am persuaded that you have not the least apprehension from your connection with them but remember louisa the dangers that we see are easily prevented but those strike surest that come unexpected like lightning which we view and feel at once   i am much pleased that sir williams niece is to live with you there is a something flattering even to virtue in having a constant witness to approve our conduct at least i think we should be more at ease more selfassured in any trial with a companion than when left alone  not that i think my sister so to seek or so unprincipled in virtues book to need a guard save her own purity   i remember poor stern used to say that all the mischief which was done in this great city was brought about by morning teteatetes  which must be unavoidable without a female inmate and she should always be a near relation  on this principle i think you extremely lucky in having miss westly for an eleve  as her presence will be a perpetual guard against another danger you have to fear the envenomed tongue of slander   the house is an uproar what can be the matter sir george is returned  i fly to him   o louisa my heart is in rent in pieces i have seen my brother almost distracted his manly face bedewed with flowing tears miss colville is dead she died at amiens of a three days fever  my brother met her hearse at dover  i fear louisa he will never recover this sad stroke  sweet delia i may say with the queen in hamlet  i thought thy bridebed to have decked sweet maid and not have strewed thy grave  i cannot write more my tears blind me  you know that i most truly loved this dear departed saint her brutal mother is gone on to paris would she and her whole race had perished in her stead  my brothers bell rings adieu adieu my sister  f cleveland  letter xi lady barton to miss cleveland my dearest fanny your letter has affected me more than i can express i am indeed most truly grieved for my brother for the sweet delia and yourself  yet why lament for her whose state i envy her life was innocence her death was arly would mine had been so too  young as she was she yet had tasted sorrow her mothers cruelty in first accepting sir georges proposals for her and then rejecting him without a cause preyed on her tender heart she loved him fanny and he deserved her passion  her death has sealed his constancy her merits nay her beauties are graved upon his heart in their full luster they will remain for ever undiminishd in his memory and bloom before him from the silent tomb my dearest brother how my heart bleeds for thine  i would write to him fanny but fear to increase his grief by mentioning the cause  you will be watchful over his distress till times lenient power shall blunt the arrows of disastrous love and soften its sharp pangs to gentle melancholy why am i not with you to share this tender office alas why am i not any where but where i am  o my sister i could a tale unfold  but i will not add to your present distress nor take off your attention from that dear brother to whom it may be useful to bestow it on one to whom it cannot be of service but who will ever be with the tenderest affection to sir george and you a faithful  friend and sister louisa barton ps as soon as my spirits will permit i shall reply to the first part of your last letter  i will not now my fanny insist on regular answers as i am sure you will devote every moment of your time to our dear mourner but if any extraordinary particular relative to poor delia shoud come to your knowledge pray acquaint me with it    letter xii lady barton to miss cleveland i now sit down to thank my dearest fanny for the kind caution she gave me in the first part of her last letter i will try if possible to forget the melancholy conclusion of it and reply only to what relates to myself  i have had harriet westley with me for some days and find as much comfort in her innocent and cheerful society as my unhappy situation will admit but alas she is incapable of administering either consolation or advice to me her knowledge of the world is even less than mine nor would i for that world render her wretched by reposing the distresses of my perturbated mind in her soft bosom  o fanny there is neither friend nor confidante for a married woman who does not find them both in her husband  i am almost afraid to communicate my thoughts to you yet why for they are innocent  but letters may miscarry a thousand accidents bring them to light and often undo the peace of the poor writer  but i have naught to lose my peace is fled your apprehensions are but too well sounded i am in the most imminent danger from my acquaintance with colonel walter  but as isabella says danger claudio it is here and every where our forced companion the rising and the setting sun beholds us environed with it our whole lifes a journey ending in certain ruin would mine were come to the last stage  i told you before that lord lucan was extremely altered from gay to grave and that colonel walter affected to know the cause of this sudden transition and repeatedly offered to acquaint me with it which i constantly declined and turned it off with raillery   i will confess to you that i before suspected what the colonel meant to inform me of women are generally too quick sighted in these matters and i by no means wished to have my doubts upon this subject confirmed i observed that whenever lord lucan was present the colonel used to strive to sit as near me as possible and frequently whisper nothing in my ear then laugh as if he had said something smart and lively i have often looked grave and sometimes silly on these occasions but could not divine the meaning of this absurd behavior till this morning   i was at work in my dressing room and harriet reading to me when lucy came in  i could visibly discover that something had affected or ruffled her mind and therefore made a pretense to send harriet out of the room  as soon as she was gone lucy burst into tears and drew a letter out of her pocket which she had just received from colonel walter she made a thousand apologies for putting it into my hands but said she knew not how to act upon so nice and critical an occasion  the contents were as follow  to miss leister dear madam the friendship you profess for lady barton of which i can no more doubt the sincerity than my own to you inclines me to acquaint her through such a proper medium of an affair which i think of some consequence to her but of which she at present seems wilfully ignorant through i dare say you and every other person who knows her except sir william have long seen the ardent passion which lord lucan has conceived for her  now really my dear lucy it is a thousand pities that such a fine young man should waste his life in sighs and groans for a perverse beauty who will not even deign to own that she perceives his passion we all know it is impossible that she can love her husband and in that case it is highly propable that she should love somebody else and why not her poor sighing swain  i have tried every possible means to prevail on lord lucan to avow his passion but the simpleton denies it even to me though he must be sensible that i have seen its rise and progress from the first moment he beheld her at pangor ferry to this present writing  i have even attempted to make him jealous by an affected familiarity with lady barton though both she and you know que mon coeur est devoue a madame votre tante  but all this i will swear i did in pure good will in hopes of bringing the lovers to an explanation which might possibly prevent their going on at the absurd rate they do at present  you know my dear lucy that i have a very high opinion of lady barton i therefore could not presume to mention lord lucan as a lover for her ladyship if i were not perfectly convinced that he is as true a platonic as she or even your little romantic self   i would not by any means have you venture to show her this letter but you ladies have a thousand agreeable ways of conveying a secret to each other especially where you have reason to imagine that the information will not be displeasing  i shall have the honor of seeing you this evening at mrs laytons but pray dont take notice of this letter to her or to any other person but the one whom it concerns  adio mia bella e buona figliuola   j walter   i shall never be able to describe what i felt upon reading this detestable scroll this outrage to honor delicacy friendship virtue but how to act it was impossible to think of showing such a letter to a husband as the consequences must in all probability and ought to have been fatal  and neither lucy nor i could submit to the meanness of telling a falsehood by saying she had not shown me the letter   in this dilemma i determined on sending for colonel walter myself to speak my sentiments to him upon the occasion which i did  he came and on my asking him what i had ever done to provoke his malice or how he dared to insult me by his letter to miss leister he burst into an affected laugh and said he was sorry to find that english ladies had no idea of a jest that he really meant nothing more than a little badinage and to bring about a kind of platonic galantry between lord lucan and me which might serve to amuse us in the long evenings we were to pass together at southfield but if his raillery had given me a moments pain he asked my pardon and promised never to offend again on the same subject   i was in prudence obliged to acquiesce with this insincere submission but from this hour i know him for mine enemy  o fanny what a situation is mine would to heaven i could exchange it for that of our dear departed delia  she is at peace my sister  while i  but let me not distress you farther  tell me i conjure you tell me that my brothers virtue and philosophy have calmed his sorrows and that he now only feels that sort of tender regret which arises from the fond idea of a long absent friend  tell me something of yourself but let that something give me leave to hope that you are happy and i shall repine the less at my own wretchedness  my true love waits on sir george and you adieu my fanny  louisa barton  letter xiii miss cleveland to lady barton my dear louisa i have received both your letters and really think no situation can be more difficult than yours but as you see the precipice before you i will trust in that good providence which is the guardian and support of innocence that he will enable you to avoid it  i am persuaded i felt as much resentment as yourself on reading colonel walters letter i perfectly approve of your not showing it to sir william but i cannot by any means divine what could be the motive for writing it   ever since you mentioned the change in lord lucans behavior i have had some apprehensions of his passion for you but would not hint them for fear of giving you uneasiness  o my louisa how nicely circumspect must your conduct be if you mean to escape the dangers that surround you and how much brighter than gold seven times tried in the furnace will that conduct appear when it has passed through more than a trial ordeal unsullied and unhurt   you have never given me the least reason to apprehend that sir william is inclinable to jealousy this is certainly a very fortunate circumstance in your present situation but do not suffer yourself to be lulled into a state of security by his apparent indolence vigilant and watchful must that woman be who has so many foes to shield against  the unkindness of sir william  the passion and merits of lord lucan  the arts and malice of colonel walter  but the last and most formidable  shall i venture to speak out  is your own heart  you have not yet begun to suspect it it is therefore the more dangerous enemy examine it my sister call it to strict account and if you find one sentiment or wish that lurks in secret there unworthy of yourself banish it i beseech you thoughts even without purposes are criminal where our honor is in question consider the slightest idea of this kind as a young serpent though stingless now its growth will give it strength and power to wound the breast that nursed and cherished it crush it betimes louisa and be at peace for life  i weep faster than i write my brothers unhappiness and yours have sunk my spirits to the lowest ebb he is still inconsolable  he has received a most extraordinary letter from brute colville  i can call her nothing else  she says she hopes he has by this time surmounted his grief for her daughter as it is highly irrational to mourn for one who is so surely happy  she entreats him to go directly to paris as she has something very particular to inform him of relative to delias last request which she will not communicate by letter  this hint has roused sir georges curiosity or rather awakened the fond desire of fulfilling any wish that delia might have made yet he says he could not bear the fight of mrs colville whom he considers as her daughters murderer and the destroyer of his earthly happiness   i know not what to think of this affair but i most earnestly wish that he would go any where  exercise is always of service to an oppressed mind  like the wheels of a machine it lessens the weight which rest restores again  however sir george shall not go by amiens if he goes at all and that i have any power to persuade him   no one can tell where lord hume has been for some time past  the only letter i received was dated from naples which he said he should quit the next day and write to me the moment he was determined to fix at any place  if a brothers and sisters unhappiness did not at present take up all my thoughts and as it were usurp the place of my own sorrow i could allow it ample scope louisa but i will now restrain it at least within my own breast and indulge myself in the more generous sensation of grieving for the distresses of those who are more wretched and not less dear to me than myself  sir george returns your love an hundred fold i have never given him the least hint of your being unhappy as i knew it would render him still more so  i do not think that even a brother should interfere between husband and wife unless matters were come to such extremities as i hope they never will between sir william and you  i would by all means wish you to make a friend though not a confidante of the young harriet if her heart and understanding be good her want of knowledge in the ways of the world will not render her a less eligible companion or adviser there is something extremely striking in the natural sentiments of an untainted mind  they resemble the purity and delicacy of water drank at the fountain before it has been impregnated with these adventitious flavours which it acquires in its currency  i know not why but i am vastly prejudiced in harriets favor  i am apt to think she will lessen your domestic uneasinesses or at least prevent your brooding over them in solitude and silence  if i ever visit you in ireland i shall endeavor to obtain a corner of her little innocent heart this will be no robbery for i flatter myself that she will love you the better the more she loves me  miss granville is returned from bath she is at present my only companion  within these two days sir george has admitted her into his apartment she has lost all her spirits and vivacity and is perfectly qualified to perform the part of a mute in a tragedy for she sighs often and never speaks she has not however communicated the cause of her mourning to me yet i fancy if she were obliged to sing a french song maudit amor would be the first that would occur to her  you will easily perceive that my letters like yours are written at different intervals and i hope you will also perceive that my spirits are better than when i began this epistle though nothing particular has happened to enliven them except my taking an airing with sir george and my quondam admirer mr loyd in richmond park this morning  the moral of the tale i sing as before is that air and exercise are the best medicines in the world both for mind and body  by the way i hope you both continue and indulge your passion for riding  i hear the outlets about dublin are delightful you will be unpardonable if you dont visit them all  pray give my love to the little harriet you may also offer it to sir william for indeed i am very well inclined even to bestow since he will not suffer me to pay it to him  adieu adieu ma tres chere soeur f cleveland ps pray enquire of lord lucan if he ever hears from lord hume    letter xiv lord hume to lord lucan naples yes my dear lucan i will acknowledge your censure just in some degree and that i think is full as much as can be expected from a person of my lively and volatile disposition  we idle fellows are seldom perverse enough to defend our follies or perhaps the same indolence of temper which makes us commit prevents our justifying them  no matter from what principle our humility arises i hate searching for remote causes  it is like seeking for a grain of wheat in a bushel of chaff i never was a good logician though a very tolerable sophist for myself at least and while i find the effects of my passion for the lovely margarita pleasant i shall never perplex myself with endeavoring to find out why they are so  you cannot my dear lucan have an idea of any thing half so charming or you would not only excuse but countenance my fondness by your own admiration  no hang it i should not like that either  nor would i have you see her for a thousand guineas notwithstanding what you say of your being already in love  you know i thought myself the most enamoured swain alive when i left england and used to write you the most doleful accounts of my sufferings  you laughed t them then i laugh at them now  tempora aut mores mutantur  no matter which i cannot help however sometimes feeling a little qualm not of conscience though lucan for my former mistress  she is handsome i confess but margarita is divine  when i landed on the continent i was such a novice in love as to fancy that i could not bear a six months absence from fanny cleveland but i had not been six days acquainted with my present object when i found that i could sacrifice friends country nay myself to her i had never felt passion before and what is life without passion sweet passion of love  i have i hope dealt like a man of honor with miss cleveland by not dissembling with her i have written but once to her since i came here and then told her i intended to stay abroad for three years and had not fixed upon any place of residence nay even said i should quit naples directly merely to prevent her writing to me  i hope she will understand all this properly and that her pride will get the better of whatever regard she might have had for me and that whenever i return to england if that should ever happen i may find her what i really wish married entirely to her own satisfaction  for notwithstanding my infidelity i think it impossible that i should ever be capable of divesting myself of the warmest interest in her happiness i have now my dear lucan laid my heart as open before you as i would were i a catholic to my confessor i expect much more from you than i should from him not only absolution and indulgence but a reciprocal confidence also  tell me who and what this fair hibernian is whose torrid charms have been able to thaw your frozen zone is it une affair de coeur ou dhonneur is she kind or cruel brown or fair in short deal as frankly with me as i have done with you and we shall then have mutually exchanged the truest test of friendship with each other  yours most truly hume ps i purpose spending the winter here and setting out early in spring either to rome or venice which ever my fair compass points her taper index to that we may enjoy the carnival together    letter xv lord lucan to lord hume my dear hume your letter has relieved me from a thousand apprehensions which i suffered on your account  it is written in the true spirit of a heart at ease which no man ever possessed that was thoroughly in love  and though you call me grave and philosophic i am much better pleased that your present attachment should be of the frolic than the serious kind  most of our young men of fortune and fashion look upon a foreign mistress as a part of their traveling equipage and i think margarita as well qualified to fill up the train of milord anglois as any other of her sister sirens  of the opera  i have seen her often and acknowledge her beauty though i could gaze on her for ever without feeling any other effect from her charms but what might arise in my mind from contemplating her picture  yet i do not think her inanimate on the contrary she has great vivacity both in her looks and manners but alas she is totally devoid of sensibility that first of female charms her eyes are taught to languish and every graceful movement of her form has been acquired in the school of art  read the thirtyseventh and fiftieth letters of ninon de lenclos to the marquis de sevige and they will help you to judge more justly both of her and yourself they are cases exactly in point  she lived with the marquis de richelieu at turin when i was there  i knew him intimately he adored margarita and was one of the handsomest and most amiable young men i ever met with  he died of a fever i pitied margarita from my soul and about ten days after his death went to pay her a visit of condolance and was informed she had set out for naples two days before with an english gentleman whose name was williams  i am much too young to set up for a stoic or a cynic i know nay i feel all the weaknesses and follies of youth yet i cannot help thinking that an attachment to a worthless woman is capable of debasing the noblest mind  virtue i fear is not radical in human nature its seed must be sown by precept cherished by example and cultivated by habit but when the object of our affections has a distinct interest rather to extinguish than inspire it the general bias of our passions aided by the natural indolence of dissipation and debauchery suffer the plant to wither in its bloom and thus obliterates the truest character of manhood  on the contrary let the most vicious man become truly enamoured of a virtuous woman and he will at least assume the semblance of those virtues he admires in her and use as hamlet says can almost change the stamp of nature and master even the devil or throw him out with wondrous potency  i find myself growing grave prematurely for there is but one paragraph in your letter that i meant to answer seriously you may easily guess  i mean the one where you speak of miss cleveland and seem to acquiesce so entirely in your behavior toward her  and now that i have entered upon this subject i am at a loss to know how to treat it properly  i would fain persuade myself you were but in jest yet surely it is wrong to trifle with the esteem of a friend by suffering me to suppose that you could possibly behave so unworthily to a woman of merit and honor  that the gaiety and levity of your temper and your youth might render it possible nay probable that you should change your affections and cease to love a mistress you once admired i can readily believe  but that you can suffer an amiable woman whom you both flattered and inspired with a serious passion for you to be informed of your inconstancy through so coarse a medium as rudeness and neglect i will not nay i cannot suppose  my friend knows better what he owes to himself and to the world  i must be excused from replying to your queries relative to the object of my passion except so far as to afford you some faint description of her beauty and merits her personal charms are so obvious that whoever views her does not wait to judge  they strike so suddenly that we feel before we think the excellencies of her character require some refinement to become sensible of  one must have a nice discernment for natural beauties and a certain classic taste for the great simple  her mind is in such a state of perfect nature that she is not to be examined by the rules of common life for her words her actions and her whole manners borrow a peculiar propriety from herself alone  she appears to be a sort of privileged genius of whom may be said with milton  that whatsoer she says or does  seems wisest virtuousest discreetest best   in others we may trace the mechanical finger of the nurse the mother the tutoress or the priest  in her can be discovered but one only forming hand  even his who made her  in fine such beauties both of mind and person have inspired your till now insensible friend with the most tender ardent and hopeless love that ever yet possessed a human heart and in my breast shall that fond love lie ever buried  i think it will not cease even with my life but death itself shall never force me to reveal my passion  press me no farther on this theme my friend nor cast away your useless pity on me for while i can behold her lovely form and gaze in silent rapture on her beauty i am not wretched  nay in those blissful moments i feel a sort of happiness i would not change for all your joys with margarita  you may very probably have but an imperfect idea of that kind of passion which i have described but do not from thence unphilosophically conclude that it cannot exist in any heart because you do not feel it in your own this i know to be a common but erroneous mode of judging  we are all too apt to search in our own breasts for the motives of other peoples actions and when a want of sympathy of sentiment prevents our discovering similar principles in ourselves we are too often tempted to deny their existence in others  i have particularly warned you my dear hume on this subject because i am certain i could full as easily forgive your doubting my honor as the unsullied purity of my passion  i most sincerely wish you every pleasure that a life of frolic and gayety can yield but beware my dear hume of those thorns that grow spontaneous with the rose  write to miss cleveland i conjure you and when your leisure will permit bestow a few lines on yours sincerely  lucan  letter xvi lord hume to lord lucan may i perish this moment if ever i read such a letter i shall begin to look upon ovids metamorphoses as a history of serious and natural events and not be at all surprised if i should find myself fluttering through the air in the form of a lapwing or a butterfly  surely your transformation is still more miraculous what lucan the gay the lively lucan changed into a melancholy timid whining lovesick swain and death itself shall never force him to reveal his passion why what in the name of nonsense must she be that has inspired it deaf and blind i suppose  for no woman that has ears and eyes need ever be informed that a man is in love with her  in those cases they are sharpsighted as the lynx and quickeared as the mole and i would lay a thousand guineas that your dulcinea was thoroughly informed of her conquest before you were even aware of it yourself   but why you are so cruelly bent upon not indulging her with a repetition of her triumph i cannot for my soul conceive  i have formed a million of conjectures about whom and what she is and have at length acquiesced in believing her to be the sanctified spouse of some methodist teacher or presbyterian parson for you have according to your own plan assumed the semblance of those virtues which such a puritan fair one might also pretend to  and so poor margarita is compounded of art and wants the first of female charms sensibility beware my friend that your idol may not have one vice more at least than mine i mean hypocrisy  the marquis de richelieu is still remembered and regretted by margarita though she did not absolutely break her heart for his loss as you may perhaps vainly imagine your dovelike dame your saint trembleur whom nothing but the spirit can move would do for you  in short you are welcome to make as free with me as you please the privileges of friendship permit it but neither its laws nor those of chivalry can pardon an affront or injury offered to the heroine of our romance  besides you must be but a bad philosopher lucan if you do not know that there is such a perverseness in human nature that the abusing a mistress is the surest way of rivetting the lovers chains   i will be revenged and love her better for it   and so you are very angry that i have not written a full and true account of my inconstancy to miss cleveland why how the devil can any man sit down to tell a woman that he no longer loves her but it is a proper measure i owe it to myself and to the world  i repeat your words seriously here for i think them just  and now you will for ever oblige me my dear lucan if you will do it for me for may i die this moment if i am not so wholly illiterate in this noble science of defense that i know not even how to set about it  on my honor i both respect esteem and admire miss cleveland more than any woman in the world however the caprice of my heart may have rendered me capable of an infidelity and i most devoutly wish that i had address enough to extricate myself out of this unlucky business without sacrificing any more of my character than i fear is already forfeited  i cannot help smiling when you say while i can behold her lovely form etc but i must acknowledge this to be the best perhaps the only receipt in the world for insuring our constancy  i will frame it into a distich extempore for the help of memory   your love would you preserve the same still fan but never feed the flame if you were at rome instead of dublin i should swear that you were turned virtuoso and became enamoured of madame la venus de medicis or some other old fashioned marble beauty  the worlds a farce and it is acted thus  the bad impose on others the good deceive themselves  but happiness the way we choose it is sufficient for us all and as you are so very reasonable in your option they must be niggards indeed who would desire to deprive you of the least portion of it therefore that you may long possess ideas is the complying wish of yours ever  hume  letter xvii lady barton to miss cleveland southfield january   i have this moment received my dear fannys last letter though from the date i think i should have been in possession of it much sooner but perhaps sir william detained it on purpose to deliver it to me on this day as knowing it to be the most agreeable new years gift he could have presented me with in return then my fanny accept my thanks and fervent prayer for your happiness  but i have something more substantial than wishes to contribute toward it for i can with truth inform you that the little time i have spent here has passed away much more agreeably than any that has elapsed since i left doverstreet  to a mind not perfectly at ease there is something extremely pleasing in the quietness of the country it is like that artificial repose which is acquired by opiates after long watching  like that too though it neither strengthens nor nourishes it allows us time to recover our faculties which are often as much harrassed by living constantly in the midst of crowds as our nerves are by an acute disease  i am very glad to find that sir william loves the country and is particularly fond of this place where nature seems to have exerted her utmost powers to please  if it is charming now when stripped of all its ornaments think what it will be when summer shall redeck it in its leafy pride and spread her gorgeous carpet over the plains  i look forward with delight to the happy era of your arrival here which i hope will be early in spring and as the irish parliament meet but every second winter i purpose spending the intermediate time of their recess in this sweet retirement with my fanny my harriet my books music drawing planning planting and perhaps there may be a little interloper who will i trust increase both our pleasures and employments  my lucy too will be near if not with us for colonel walters house is about five miles from hence and every thing seems in great forwardness for his marriage with mrs layton  i begin to flatter myself that he is really in love with the lady he is going to marry for he talks of her incessantly yet lucy has remarked that he spends more of his time here than at mr ushers where mrs layton is now upon a visit though that is two miles nearer to waltersburgh that is the name of his seat than this  he is to give a magnificent ball at his house next week he asked me last night to dance with him on that occasion which i refused as i thought he ought to show every mark of attention to his future bride  i shall not however dance with any other person not so much on his account as for a reason i have hinted at above  i fear you will chide me for not having mentioned my present situation to sir william as it is natural to suppose it would give him pleasure and indeed i wish to do so but there is something so indelicate in his manner of treating this subject that i have not yet been able to prevail upon myself to speak of it to him  lord lucan has been absent from us some days on a visit to sir arthur ashford  they are both expected here this evening  i have great pleasure in observing that lord lucan is vastly more cheerful and seemingly at his ease than he was before we left dublin  indeed i think we are all so which serves to illustrate your favorite opinion as well as the latter part of your last letter that air exercise and change of objects are of infinite use both to the mind and body  from my not mentioning my brother till now do not conclude that i have for a moment forgotten him or his griefs they will live together in my memory to the last period of my existence  i cannot conceive why mrs colville should wish to see sir george as she must be conscious of having done him an irreparable injury and sure there is nothing on earth so formidable as the sight of a person we have wronged  yet i earnestly wish that he knew his delias request as the obeying it would afford him a very high though a melancholy pleasure   sad luxury to vulgar minds unknown   i wish too with you that he would go abroad  do my fanny send him to search for your wanderer on the continent and in the mean time do you take sanctuary in this island which boasts a privilege of being free from all noisome animals  you may therefore at least promise yourself safety if not delight amongst us  i am sorry for the change you mention in mary granville her charming vivacity would i hoped have assisted you in keeping up your spirits under the treble pressure of my brothers mine and your own distresses which i begin to fear will soon outweigh ours for i think that even the death of the object of our affections is more supportable than their unkindness  this hint is meant to arm you for i confess that lord humes silence has made me think he is in the high road of inconstancy and i do most earnestly wish that you would endeavor to forget him and be happy   i have my dearest sister at your request most seriously examined my heart and will heartily acquaint you with its real situation  it is free from love and thence is all its danger  o why am i debarred the chaste indulgence of a virtuous passion why must a heart that overflows with tenderness have all its currents dammed like a poor river forced from its natural course am i to blame if it should steal away in useless nay improper channels  but hitherto my sister all is safe  the man i most esteem i have no passion for nor feel a fonder warmth on mentioning his name than my dear brothers  this surely is an innocent affection  had i been his wife  but you have warned me not even to hazard much less indulge such thoughts  harriet is vastly happy at your predilection for her and bids me offer you the second place in her heart  she kindly and i believe at present truly says i occupy the first  yours is i think likely to be the most permanent station as i shall have many rivals to contend for mine and happy will he be who shall displace me   lucy who came hither with me is this day gone to pay her respects to her aunt at mr ushers we are to meet them at waltersburgh next monday and she is then to return with me to southfield where we have alas but a very few days to spend before we set out for dublin i shall truly regret the changing of the scene  but must obey  sir william returns his affectionate compliments to my brother and you and was kind enough to say he wished you would both come over and see how we live here  what is still more extraordinary he seemed both surprised and concerned when i told him of our dear delias death for he is sometimes tender when he is off his guard so that i often flatter myself that it is rather his manners which are harsh and not his nature hard you see how i strive to sooth myself and plead for him he says he cannot be persuaded that she could die in three days unless it were of a french physician  sir arthur ashford his sister and lord lucan are this moment arrived i have never seen the lady but hear she is extremely handsome grant heaven that lord lucan may think so now fanny you can have no doubts or fears  adieu my sister  l barton  letter xviii lady barton to miss cleveland report does not always exaggerate  miss ashford is really beautiful  the ladies of this country are in general remarkably fair but the whiteness of her skin surpasses any that i have ever seen her eyes are dark hazel her hair jet black which forms such a contrast to her neck and forehead as images shakespeares simile  fairer than snow upon a ravens back   she is tall and thin and though not elegantly made appears perfectly genteel  while she sits still  but the moment she is thrown into motion or emotion she ceases to be lovely  a something more than want of grace accompanies her action and every movement of her head or hands seems performed in opposition to nature  in short she is the only young person i have ever seen whom vivacity does not become she seems sensible mild goodnatured and in every respect qualified for making an amiable figure  in still life  i am much pleased to find that sir william is extremely hospitable to his country neighbors and likes to have company in his house this tendency may doubtless be attended with some inconveniences which i had rather submit to than live unknown and unloved amongst ones tenants and dependants  it is their industry and labor which supports our affluence and they certainly have a right to a certain share in our enjoyments in proportion to their rank and situation  an accident that happened this morning had like to have triumphed over sir williams good humor which is not of the invincible kind  as we sat at breakfast in a room that looks into the garden i observed miss ashfords eyes fixed on a particular object in the walk before us  i thought she seemed surprised and i naturally directed a look of inquiry to discover the occasion which was a little basket that appeared to move though gently of itself  the moment i mentioned this circumstance the gentlemen came to the window and lord lucan flew directly into the garden and explained the phenomenon by bringing the basket and its contents into the parlour which was an infant about a week old clean though poorly clad with a paper pinned to its breast which said this child has been baptized by its fathers name william  this circumstance disconcerted sir william who after many unnecessary asseverations of his innocence upon this occasion at which the whole company smiled as they knew that he had been above a year out of the kingdom determined to prove his virtue at the expense of his humanity by ordering the child to be again left in the garden where it was found till the parish officers should come to take charge of it and by commanding a strict search to be made for the mother that she might be punished according to law  we all opposed the severity of this resolution as the poor infant appeared almost perished with cold and hunger but sir william persisted in acting like an upright magistrate according to the letter of the law  till lord lucan declared that he was ready to adopt the little foundling and promised to take care of it for life though his name was thomas sir william then relaxed a little of his austerity and gave vent to the remainder of it by attacking lord lucan with all the coarse raillery usual upon such occasions  i confess i was pleased with this instance of his lordships humanity  i have seen many others even in the short term of our acquaintance  yet at this instant i could wish to have robbed him of this little act of benevolence and have transferred it to sir william  there is a secret and involuntary sympathy that attaches us to generous minds  our affections are insensibly rivetted by esteem and in that case we may defy even the power of time to break the charming tie o why am i not bound in such a chain  though you will see by my letter that i had nothing to say when i began to write yet as it is probable that i shall not have half an hours leisure for some days to come i have devoted the present moment to convince my fanny that she is never absent from my thoughts to enquire after here is and sir georges health and to assure her of the sincerest regard of her ever affectionate  l barton  letter xix miss cleveland to lady barton distracted as i am with my own griefs let me thank my dear sister for having removed some of those apprehensions which i had suffered on her account and by that means leaving my heart as it should now be devoted to selfish undivided sorrow  lord hume is false louisa i am forsaken in the pride of youth but for whom i know not  i cannot write read the enclosed then give the hateful scroll to the devouring flames  no send it back  alas for what the fatal lines are graved too deeply on my breaking heart  my brother set out for paris last week a second letter from mrs colville more ambiguous than the former determined him i am glad he is gone  i should have tried but fear it would have been in vain to hide my anguish from him  and he has griefs too weighty of his own to suffer me to add resentment to them  you say your heart is free from love louisa o triumph in that blessed indifference and know you cannot taste the extreme of wretchedness without feeling a tender passion for an unworthy object  ah fond remembrance blinds me   if i were capable of joy i should receive it from the hint you give of your being soon likely to be blessed with a proper object for your utmost sensibility repine no more my sister but let the current of your fondness flow in this most natural and pleasing course in the rich channel of maternal love  i entreat you to acquaint sir william as soon as possible with this happy event there are numberless reasons that render it proper those you urge against it are childish your situation must naturally increase his tenderness and of course your happiness which is all that can now diffuse the smallest gleam of satisfaction to your ever affectionate  f cleveland ps i have this moment received a second letter from you for which i return my thanks but am not at present able to write more    letter xx lord hume to miss cleveland madam a consciousness of error is they say the first step toward reformation but there are some cases in which we may be sensible of having done amiss yet find it impossible to amend this is certainly a very unpleasing situation and well worthy of pity from a generous mind  so circumstanced i acknowledge myself and throw myself at your feet for pardon  can you madam rise so far above the unworthy man who asks it as to grant him your forgiveness while he confesses that the natural inconstancy of his sex and the mutability of his disposition have triumphed over a passion which was once his highest happiness and honor and which he then thought would have been as permanent as his life  i cannot without descending to the meanness of a falsehood affect to suppose that i am indifferent to you i know but too well that i was honored with a place in your affection  but i also know that miss cleveland has sense and resolution sufficient to conquer her regards for one who owns himself unworthy of it  humiliating confession  let me however madam as a motive to your forgiveness plead the small and only merit that is in my favor the not having attempted to deceive you  i can now only add that notwithstanding the change of my affections rather than my sentiments i shall ever retain the sincerest respect and if i may be allowed the expression the tenderest esteem for miss cleveland to whom i have the honor to be  a most devoted and obedient servant hume  letter xxi miss westley to miss cleveland waltersburgh how happy should i be my dear madam in having the honor of paying my respects to you by letter and thanking you for the kind partiality you have expressed in my favor to my dear aunt if her illness had not been the occasion of my writing but dont be alarmed madam she is at present out of danger though still so weak as to be unable to write even to you  she was taken ill the day after she came here and miscarried the day following how i grieve for the loss of my dear little cousin he would have been a charming plaything for us all you cannot imagine how much my uncle has fretted about it but though my poor dear aunt has the most reason to be sorry she bears every thing with her usual sweetness of temper  but i need not expatiate on her gentleness to you who know her for every creature who does must be charmed with her  miss leister who was to have been here with us was confined with a quinzy at mr ushers when my aunt grew ill but she came to us yesterday and the gentlemen are all gone to dublin  it was intended that we should be very merry when we arrived here but i never saw such a dismal house i long to get back to southfield which i hope we shall be able to do in a few days  my aunt desires me to assure you of her tenderest affection and says she will write the moment she can hold a pen  i hope my dear miss cleveland will not take an aversion to me for being the messenger of disagreeable news but believe that it would have afforded me the sincerest pleasure to have informed her that my aunt was as well and happy as i know she deserves to be and i most truly wish her i have the honor to be dear madam  your much obliged and most obedient servant harriet westley ps i dont know whether you are acquainted with lord lucan but i cannot help telling you that he had the misfortune to sprain his leg so that he could not dance or walk even the first day he came  there never was any thing so unlucky as this party has been for every one has had something to distress them    letter xxii miss cleveland to miss westley i lament with you my dear harriet that our correspondence should commence on an occasion so painful to us both as lady bartons illness but i should be unworthy of that regard which you seem inclined to show me if it were possible that i should conceive any dislike to you for acquainting me with our common misfortune i mean the loss of our little cousin  however as you assure me that my sister is at present out of danger i think we may reasonably hope that our present loss may be repaired in future and that we may yet have many pretty playthings in which we shall be mutually interested  the sweetness of lady bartons temper must interest all who know her in her sufferings of every kind and lessen even to herself the painful sensations arising from her present disagreeable situation  such is the potent power of gentleness i have no doubt of your tender attachment to her there is a natural sympathy between the good and amiable which far exceeds the ties either of affinity or consanguinity  i have not the honor of knowing lord lucan but am sorry for the accident he has met with both for his sake and yours as i fancy his lameness interfered with the amusement you proposed to yourself in dancing  but we are all liable to disappointments my young friend and may this be one of the greatest that you shall ever experience  assure my beloved sister of my servent and unceasing wishes for her speedy recovery and believe me to be my dear miss westleys  affectionate friend and servant f cleveland  letter xxiii lady barton to miss cleveland waltersburgh my dearest fanny i lay hold of the first possible moment to calm your fears for my safety i mean with regard to my health harriet by my desire has given you an account of the accident that befell me here but she and all the world are strangers to the cause of it  but before i enter into a detail that must affect you let me congratulate my dearest sister upon the timely discovery of lord humes inconstancy  rejoice my fanny that this worthless man is not your husband and that you are at liberty to indulge your resentment or contempt without a breach of duty  this though you may not be sensible of it is certainly an allevation of the misery which arises from illplaced love  but time and your sense and virtue will i hope enable you to triumph over any remain of weakness for such an unworthy object  yet contemptible as he is i cannot help being pleased with his letter frankness always charms me and like charity in my mind it covers a multitude of faults  do not from what i have said imagine that i think lightly of your present distress i am convinced that to a heart tender and good as yours it must be severe but i also know that there are other situations much more intolerable and i am almost tempted to exclaim with lord littleton   what are alas thy woes compared to miner you shall be yourself the judge and i will now proceed  sir arthur miss ashford lord lucan sir william harriet and i set out together for this place the monday after i wrote to you  we were to have met mrs layton miss leister the family of the ushers and several other ladies and gentlemen of the neighborhood  the first mortification i received was hearing that my lucy was ill of a sore throat and could not come from ushers grove her aunt and the rest of the family came but were all to return after supper  i told you in my last that i had refused to dance with colonel walter i was also asked by lord lucan but desired to be excused and entreated he would take miss ashford for his partner he said he would obey me and accordingly desired the honor of her hand which she readily granted  about a quarter of an hour before the ball began he unluckily strained his leg and was not able to fulfill his engagement  sir william though not fond of dancing was polite enough to supply his place and lord lucan and i were reduced to play at quadrille with a couple of dowagers and an old parson  the evening however passed off very tolerably and we retired to our chambers about twelve oclock the gentlemen had agreed to meet and hunt the next morning and i determined to pay a visit to lucy between breakfast and dinner that day for the colonel had insisted on our not leaving him till the next  according to appointment with his companions of the chase sir william rose early and left me asleep i had resolved not to acquaint him with my situation till our return to southfield as i knew that many coarse jests and commonplace sayings would pass on the occasion which i should wish to avoid at all times but especially before strangers  about eight oclock in the morning i was waked by a person who knelt at my bedside and pressed my hand to their lips  the chamber was dark i could only distinguish that it was a man and instantly concluded him to be lord lucan from this circumstance only that i recollected colonel walter was to have rode out with sir william  i strove to withdraw my hand but could not upon which i addressed him with the strongest expressions of surprise and resentment at his having dared to take so unwarrantable a liberty to which he answered only in a whisper entreating me to forgive the effects of a passion too violent to be restrained  he then attempted to press his lips to mine and when i was going to ring my bell i heard sir williams voice upon the stairs and fainted  when i came to myself i found miss ashford sir william and harriet in the room standing about my bedside  i suffered infinite anxiety at that instant to know whether sir william had found lord lucan in my chamber and what had passed between them harriet and miss ashford were bathing my temples with lavender water while sir william held one of my hands between his and as soon as he found that i was recovering pressed it gently and withdrew saying that he supposed ladies understood how to manage one another better in such circumstances than he  his calmness amazed me in short the various emotions of my mind for some time are not to be expressed  i determined on the instant to return to southfield directly let the consequence be what it would and never to suffer lord lucan to come into my sight again but alas when i attempted to rise i found it impossible the agitation of my mind had disordered my whole frame my illness increased every moment a messenger was dispatched for a physician but before he could arrive   when sir william was informed of my misfortune he raved and stamped like a madman said i must have designed to destroy his heir out of perverseness or i would certainly have acquainted him with my situation  while heaven knows i would have given my own life with pleasure to have saved my child  i continued in a state of such extreme weakness for four days that i saw no creature but benson who had been sent for express the doctor and harriet who wept continually by me  i never can forget the dear girls tenderness  on the fifth morning sir william came into the room and with an air of the utmost disatisfaction told me he was very sorry for the loss of his boy but hoped i should do well and as he could not be of any use to a sick person he had resolved to attend the meeting of parliament and should set out for dublin with the colonel and lord lucan directly  that as soon as i was able i might either return to southfield or follow him to town as i liked best  but that i need not be in a hurry to move for his good friend had left orders that i should be as well attended as if i were in my own house and that lucy leister was now recovered and would come that day to waltersburg to keep me company  he then gave me a cool kiss and withdrew  i rejoiced extremely at hearing that lord lucan was to go with sir william for though my life was at stake i would not have remained in the same house with him after my husband had left it besides it saved me the difficulty of an interview which my poor weak brain had been studying to avoid the whole time of my illness  yet i had doubts and fears that he might insolently have made a pretense to stay behind till benson assured me that she saw him set out at the same time with sir william and the colonel  just as he was going off he gave the enclosed note to harriet to deliver to me as soon as i should be able to read it the sweet girl could not conceal her emotion about it she feared she had done wrong in receiving it and with her cheeks covered with blushes and her eyes filled with tears she presented it to me begging i would excuse her if she had acted improperly  i never was more embarrassed in my life than at that moment i could have no doubt but that his letter was filled with apologies for the audaciousness of his conduct and to read it was in some measure to admit of his excuses  but while i hesitated harriet whose impatience seemed to be extreme had broken the seal and said shall i read it to you madam luckily for me that part of the chamber i sat in was so much darkened by a large screen that she did not discover my confusion therefore taking my silence for consent she proceeded to read as follows  to lady barton permit me madam to express those ardent wishes for your recovery which i have never ceased to breathe to heaven from the first moment of your illness  wishes as pure as warm and as disinterested as brothers form for a beloved sister i hoped to have had the honor of seeing you before i leave waltersburgh and i have many reasons to lament the loss of that happiness but the cause which has prevented it is even more a subject of regret than the effect and like aarons rod has swallowed up all other considerations  may returning health a wait your couch and may every happiness that heaven can grant to merit such as yours be as truly thine as the sincere respect and esteem of him who has the honor to be madam your ladyships  most obedient servant lucan ps if it be not thought too presuming i should request the favor of your permission for miss westley to honor me with a line to inform me of your health     i never felt surprise more strongly than at hearing this letter and my amazement was rather increased by the trepidation and hurry of harriets voice and manner in reading it who on the instant she had finished desired i would give her leave to write his lordship an account of my health by that very nights post  this i absolutely forbad but in order to change the subject told her i would employ her in a more interesting correspondence and desired she would immediately write to you  i confess to you fanny that lord lucans letter has puzzled me so much that i sometimes think it impossible he could have been guilty of the insult i have charged him with and not attempted to have made some apology for it  yet who else could have dared to enter my chamber or indeed who else was in the house at the time i am almost tempted to persuade myself sometimes that it was only a dream or vision that alarmed me  at other times my mind suggests some scruples to itself for not having acquainted sir william with the affair  but then again in that case i must have hazarded my husbands and some other persons life dreadful though no let me rather suffer all that fate can inflict on innocence than be the cause of one mans death or misery  the moment that lord lucan left the house i felt as if a weight had been taken off my heart  i have grown better every hour since and the company of my lucy and harriet makes me not regret the absence of any other person but yourself  for heavens sake my dearest fanny no longer deny me and yourself the indulgence of sharing my heart and alleviating its anxieties you have now nothing to detain you in england my brother will most probably stay abroad some years  but i will not say more for if your own inclination and my situation do not impel you i would not wish that my persuasions or entreaties should compel you  i have been three days about this letter and think it high time to conclude but must first acquaint you that the day benson came here she discovered a private door in my chamber which leads to another apartment through which i conclude that lord lucan had made both his entry and retreat or else sir william must have met him going out of my room at the time i fainted  adieu my fanny i will write to you as soon as i get to southfield which will be at farthest in three days  yours ever l barton  letter xxiv miss cleveland to lady barton why must i tell my dear louisa that the contents of her letter abated the pleasure i received from seeing that her hand had superscribed it this little circumstance gave me an idea of your perfect recovery while the same characters on the inside trace out a tale of unhappiness and distress and who can hope for health while the mind suffers  there is something very extraordinary in the adventure you have met with at waltersburgh but your surmise on that occasion does not appear to me to have the least foundation  on the contrary i would almost hazard any bett that lord lucan was incapable of treating you with such disrespect it is impossible i think from the whole contour of his character to suppose that he could be guilty of such an outrage to decency and honor still more incredible to believe that he should never since have thought proper to offer any sort of excuse for such a behavior especially as he proceeded so far as to frame an opportunity to himself for doing so by the respectful freedom of his letter to you for an action too which was so unfortunate in its consequences to the woman he loves  for that he loves is but too obvious  who then could it be that indeed i must be at a loss to answer any more than yourself  i am half persuaded and i wish i was entirely so that it was only a dream  but be that as it may i think you were perfectly right in concealing the affair from sir william as the knowledge of it must have been fatal at least to his repose and yours  i am very sorry that sir william should have shown more regret for the loss of his son than concern for your illness but parental fondness is i fear a stronger and more general affection in male minds than conjugal love  but indeed my dear you deserve a little mortification for your false delicacy in concealing your situation from him so kiss the rod and have done whimpering as we say to naughty children  i most earnestly wish that the business of parliament had not called sir william from home at this juncture i long till he and you are settled in a domestic way at southfield  i own i am alarmed at a married womans meeting with adventures of the novel kind  in the absence of her husband   the wife where danger or dishonor lurks  safest and seemliest by her husband stays  who guards her or with her the worst endures   to say truth i think you in almost as much danger as our fair mother to whom these words were addressed for there certainly is a serpent in the grass somewhere autour de vous  you have however the advantage of being warned of your danger provided you construe the billet you sent me as its first whisper and as a womans best safety is found in retreat i wish you would resolve to withdraw yourself from any further intimacy either with lord lucan or colonel walter  believe me my louisa they are both dangerous intimates though in a different way  i receive your congratulation as i am sure it is meant and though my mind is not yet strong enough to consider the discovery of lord humes inconstancy as a subject for rejoicing at yet i agree with you that had this change in his affections happened after i had become his wife the misfortune would have certainly been more insupportable though i cannot even at present avail myself of the resource you offer me of hating or despising a man whom i once loved  the utmost i ever hope to arrive at is to be able to speak of my affection for him in the past tense only and the most effectual way to arrive at that end is to mention him as little as possible for the future i hope your next letter will inform me of your returning health and happiness i need the assistance of them both to support my present wretchedness  may they long attend my beloved sister sincerely prays her affectionate  f cleveland  letter xxv lord lucan to lord hume dear hume i should be extremely pleased if i could like you consider the transformation of ovid as a series of serious and natural events for as i have for some time past become extremely weary of my present form or mode of existence i should be inclined to flatter myself that any change must be for the better but the metempsychosis of pythagoras would suit me still better than the metamorphoses of ovid i should like to carry my identity with me into whatever being my spirit was appointed to animate as i think the consciousness of the sufferings i now endure would render any state except that of a ferocious animal agreeable to me  but to be serious  i have been for some months past uncommonly wretched the fate of her who is the arbiter of mine hung for an age in doubtful balance i never knew the extreme of misery till then for alas i had never before given myself leave to think she was mortal yes hume all that i love in life was near the grave and i sustained the shock like a philosopher  i sighed and wept in secret while to the world i wore the specious mask of mere humanity  this was as much as i had power to do and he that says philosophy can go beyond this mark and teach us not to feel mistakes its use and makes dull apathy usurp its place  i dont know that ever i felt so much pleasure in writing as at this moment it certainly relieves our oppression to unburthen our hearts and you are my only confidant  this declaration may appear strange to you who know so little of the particulars of my attachment but when i affirm that no person breathing knows so much not even the dear object of it you may nay you must accept the title  from your last letter which i have read over several times i have collected two things which give me sincere pleasure but will surprise you extremely the first is that you endeavor to persuade yourself that you love margarita much better than you really do and the second that you not only respect and esteem but still love miss cleveland i hope you have written to her hume  every woman of worth and honor has and ought to have a proper pride neglect is therefore the most unpardonable of all offenses that a man can commit  i speak of men not brutes rudeness is of course out of the question  i was extremely diverted at the many ridiculous ideas you formed of the object of my passion but this be assured of and let it satisfy you that neither her mind or body have been perverted by any kind of art but that she is at this instant the most perfect work of the great and universal artist that i have ever yet beheld though perhaps she may not have struck you for you have seen her with the same idea of perfection  i perfectly agree with you that the word happiness has as many various meanings as there are tempers and constitutions in the world to confine it therefore to any taste passion or mode of life would be just as absurd as to drain your ponds that your fish may fly and flood your aviaries that your birds may swim be it therefore unto you as you have wished it unto me that is as you choose it  adieu my dear hume  yours most truly lucan  letter xxvi lord hume to lord lucan venice i have often told you my dear lucan that i never trouble myself to investigate causes for any thing that happens effects are enough for me so that whether your transmogrification be according to the ovidian or pythagorean system is of no sort of consequence for transmogrified you are to all intents and purposes  you may divert yourself with looking for the etymology of that word but though i dont believe you will be able to find its derivation in any dictionary it is a devilish good one for all that and truly expressive of my meaning  why my dear metamorphosed friend you had nothing of the catullus strain in you while you lived among us here but there are peculiar disorders incident to certain climates and an heavy atmosphere naturally makes people draw their breath in sighs fly then for your life my dear patient and take the air of the world once more among us again before your ailment has confirmed itself into a platonic asthma in the bogs of ireland  you have puzzled me to the last line of a riddle by saying that i have often seen your lesbia  prythee be good natured lucan and tell me when and where for guessing is rather troublesome there can be no sort of danger in letting me know who she is as you are already convinced that i dont like her or if i did may i perish if i would attempt to rival my friend with any woman breathing you may therefore be perfectly safe in making me a real confidant instead of a nominal one  margarita and i have been here this fortnight and in that time we have contrived to lose a good round sum at play she thinks we have been overmatched by the venetians and wants to try our fortune at rome but i must wait for remittances from england before i can make this or any other experiment of the kind  you are mistaken lucan i love margarita most truly and what is much more extraordinary my affection for her rather increases than abates  i have myself been made sensible of this though not in the most agreeable manner for i have lately felt somewhat of that hydra of calamities jealousy  and this though i am perfectly satisfied that my sweet girl gave me no sort of cause on her part and would not quit me for an emperor   tell me my heart if this be love   you are in some measure right with regard to my sentiments for fanny cleveland  i certainly do most thoroughly esteem her and have given the strongest proof of my having an high opinion of her understanding by writing a very foolish letter acknowledging myself what i dare say your wise worship already thinks me a very silly fellow  i dont know but as you say i may love her too  that is according to your plan of loving a la seraphique  but i have no idea of that sort of passion which can admit of a doubt or allow us time to reason about the why or wherefore of the matter  let me be charmed my senses captivated and let reason go to the schools if it will for i never found it of any use but to torment me  i am all impatience for my remittances i dont like this place nor does margarita though she has a number of relations here brothers and cousins by the dozen but they are all priests and i am apprehensive that some of these infatuates may persuade her to quit me and lock her up in a convent  the dear girl sometimes alarms me much by talking religiously but if i can get her to rome once there will be an end of these fears for i am told that there is not even the shadow of devotion there  it is now two oclock at noon and margarita has not yet blessed my eyes i fear she is not well  i must go to enquire her health i hope your fair one is recovered do tell me all about her in your next direct to me at rome i forget where but to the care of your former banker  adio mio caro amico hume  letter xxvii lady barton to miss cleveland southfield thank heaven my dearest fanny i have at last escaped out of that worse than lyons den that detestable colonel walters house  on the day after i wrote last to you as the weather was remarkably fine for the season i insisted on lucy and harriets going out to take the air and in order to harden myself for my removal i ventured into the room adjoining mine which is a very large and handsome library  benson had told me that since the colonel went to dublin she had sometimes seen a beautiful little girl of four years old running about the house but that the child could not speak english and that the servants were extremely illnanatured to the poor baby who used to weep when she could not make herself understood that she was perfectly engaging in her manner and seemed to take a liking to benson that she had enquired as much as was proper who the child belonged to and was constantly answered that they knew nothing more of her than that she was one of their masters importations  upon this report i confess that i felt my relationship to dame eve very strongly and desired benson to bring the child to me the first opportunity  she accordingly led her by the hand into the library on the day i have mentioned but the moment the child saw me she would have fled and exclaimed in french o my papa will kill me i replied to her in her own language and assured her that no harm should happen to her  she smiled upon me and asked was i a frenchwoman if i was she would love me dearly for all the people in this place she said were cross and cruel except her poor mama that she believed was dying  she then hid her face with her little hands and burst into a passion of tears  i need not tell you how i was affected  she became instantly sensible of my tenderness and suffered benson to lead her to me and set her on my knee but though she leaned her head upon my neck and seemed pleased with my caresses i could perceive that fear predominated over every other sensation by her eyes being constantly directed to the door and her appearing alarmed at every noise  i asked her where her mama was she paused for a few moments and then replied i was not forbidden to tell that she is above stairs lying upon her bed and that bed is on the ground  we dont lie so in france  the innocence and sensibility of her remark quite overcame me  she took my handkerchief and dried my eyes then said dont weep pray dont you dont sleep upon the ground nor any one else i believe except my poor mama again i kissed the lovely little pratler  i desired her to tell her mama that i should be glad to see her  she shook her head and said that was impossible for her mama was too sick to come out of her room but if she were well she must not disobey her papa and he had commanded her never to stir out while she lived  then said i my dear i will go up to her  she answered quick no no that cannot be the servants would tell my papa  i asked her would she carry a letter to her mama she said yes  i then asked her mamas name and she answered dolivet  i instantly sat down and wrote in french what follows   a madame dolivet madam i have this day seen and conversed with your lovely daughter and from her innocent yet sensible discourse i have learned that you are ill and unhappy  i have reason to apprehend that the treatment you have received from a gentleman of this country may naturally prejudice you against all its inhabitants but let me assure you that humanity and justice are the real characteristics of this nation and that if you stand in need of either you may depend on meeting them in the highest degree both from our manners and our laws  i beg leave now madam to offer you any assistance that is in the power of an individual of your own sex of some rank and consideration in this country who will esteem it a very great happiness if she can be in any way serviceable to the injured or oppressed and who most solemnly assures you that whatever confidence you are pleased to repose in her shall never be made use of but to your own advantage as it is not curiosity but compassion that inclines her to interest herself in your concerns  if you think an interview with the writer of this proper please to contrive the means and she will most readily concur with your design as she is possessed of the sincerest inclination though unknown to you to do every thing that may be in her power for your service and is with great truth your unknown friend  l barton   the child carried away the billet and returned in less than ten minutes to tell me that her mama had neither pen ink or paper but if i would be so good to let her have them she would write an answer immediately and in the mean time returned me a thousand thanks for the honor of my letter  the dear little olivet took my hand kissed it and said she was sure she should love me for she thought i had done her mama good already  i immediately furnished her with my own portefeuille which contained all the necessary implements for writing and waited not without some degree of impatience to have this mystery explained  lucy and harriet returned from their airing soon after this adventure but i did not think it proper to mention the affair to them till i was more fully informed myself  i heard nothing farther of the child or her mother till i retired into my bedchamber and then benson gave me a letter in french which i send you enclosed  to lady barton madam no words can adequately express my sense of your goodness to me but my gratitude shall while i have life be poured forth in fervent prayers for your happiness  this alas is the sole return that i can make to heaven or to you whose blessed instrument i am sure you are to speak peace and comfort to a dying wretch and smooth her passage from this vale of misery  ah madam may you never know the transports i received from reading your dear letter they can only be felt by one equally unhappy with me if such another wretch there be on earth who long denied the blessings of society debarred even the power of speaking to be understood should have an angel come and utter words of comfort and compassion  forgive me madam but i cannot help considering you as a superior being sent to the relief of misery like mine o may you think so too and ease my last sad moments of their sharped pangs it is not for myself i plead but for my innocent my unoffending child receive a more than orphan to your care and my last sigh shall waft my thanks to heaven  even the short story of my misfortunes is much too long for my weak hand to write but if you will permit me madam to throw myself at your feet when all the family are retired to rest and condescend to lend an ear to my sad tale i will relate it with the same truth and frankness as i would to my confessor you shall supply that solace long denied me and from your gracious lips i hope for absolution  i have now no terms to keep with colonel walter the hour approaches that must dissolve all the engagements that ever were between us how he has fulfilled his part of them heaven and his own heart can tell but even in my death i would not wish to offend him and were there not a much dearer concern than my own life at stake i would conceal his unkindness to the last moment of my existence would suffer my wrongs to be buried with me and sleep for ever in the silent grave  but my olivia my lovely little babe pulls at my heart strings and can i then decline the offer of your kindness and not strive to interest your compassion for her future fate impossible circumstanced as i am the mother must prevail over every other tie  i therefore again entreat the honor of being admitted to your presence this night i will come softly down the backstairs that join to the library and there wait till your woman shall conduct me to you  in the mean time and ever allow me to subscribe myself with the most heartfelt gratitude  your ladyships most obliged and devoted servant olivia walter   judge of my feelings at reading this letter by your own but though i know you will be displeased at my quitting the story here i must break off as the post is going out and i cannot send this without telling you that i have no remains of my late indisposition but weakness  peace of mind and exercise will i hope soon restore my former strength  tomorrow my fanny i will indulge you with the remainder of this affecting narrative till then  adieu l barton  lady barton to miss cleveland letter xxviii the moment i had read mrs walters letter i sent benson to wait her coming at the appointed place  as some of the family were not yet gone to bed i had near half an hours leisure to reflect on the uncommon villainy of colonel walter if this lady was his wife which i could have no doubt of from her taking his name how did he dare to propose marriage to mrs layton but this circumstance appeared trifling when compared to the inhumanity of his behavior to the unfortunate olivia and her lovely child at length benson tapped softly at my door and i rose to receive a being that seemed no longer an inhabitant of this world  from the childs account of her mothers illness i was prepared to see a person pale and emaciated but any thing so near our idea of a beautiful spectre never yet i believe struck mortal sight  i must describe her to you  her stature is somewhat above the middle size but the extreme thinness of her figure made her appear still taller  her eyes are large and of the darkest blue her nose aquiline with the most beautiful mouth and teeth i ever saw her skin fairer than alabaster and so clear that one might fancy they saw the circulation of the blood which supplied a faint blushing in her cheeks resembling the inner tints of a white rose her hair of a light shining brown flowed in loose tresses upon her shoulders  her gown was a white silk polonese she had on a gauze hood tied loosely under her chin and a slight covering of the same sort upon her neck she appeared all form without substance spirit without matter and had she prophesied my faith would have listened as to an angel   as she entered my room she made an effort which i was not lucky enough to prevent to throw herself at my feet  when i attempted to raise her from the ground i had not strength sufficient for she had fainted there with bensons assistance and mine she recovered in about ten minutes then gushed into such a flood of tears as took away all power of speech and almost suffocated her she often tried to speak and implore my pardon for the distress and trouble she had occasioned me and you may suppose that i said every thing in my power to calm her mind  as soon as she became a little collected she said it was joy not sorrow that had overpowered her weak frame the latter she had been too familiar with but the former was indeed such a long absent guest that it must be welcomed with some degree of transport  if the delicacy of her sentiments had needed any addition they would have received the highest from the sweetness of her voice and the uncommon beauty of her mouth while she uttered them  in order to restrain her acknowlegements for my interesting myself about her and her child i pressed her to relate her story and to account for the extraordinary appearances arising from her situation she bowed and proceeded with so much grace and elegance of expression that i could have hung with mute attention on her speech for a whole winters night or a long summers day and never wished her tale to have an end  the story of mrs walter  i had the misfortune to lose my father who had the honor of being a general officer in the king of sardinias service when i was but eleven years old his name was dalemberg  as he had many great and lucrative employments and my mother and he were both young they indulged themselves in a thoughtless extravagance together at turin during his life  but at his decease my mother no longer able to support the rank she had held at that court retired to briancon to live upon the small patrimony which remained for her and me  young as i was the loss of a fond father made a very deep impression on my mind and the perpetual affliction to which i saw my mother had devoted herself and which terminated her life in two years brought me full early acquainted with sorrow  after this irreparable loss i remained at briancon under the care of an old maiden aunt of my fathers who had lived too much sequestered from the world and who ignorant of the nature of youth or how to guide it supplied the place of instruction with austerity never suffered me to be a moment out of her sight and was for ever extolling her own goodness and charity in being troubled with the care of my education and maintenance  in short her manners were perfectly disagreeable and so extremely different from that delicacy and tenderness to which i had been too much accustomed that though i strove to respect her as my aunt i found it impossible either to love or esteem her  the affections of young and amiable minds cannot center in themselves and if they are not properly attached by the ties of affinity or kindness they will most probably bestow themselves on improper objects  this was unluckily my case  the only person i was suffered to converse with except my aunt and that only at home was a girl about three years elder than myself whose mother had been formerly a servant to mine but at that time kept an inn at briancon  this girl then as was natural i became extremely fond of and as my aunt grew every day more infirm and was often confined to her bed i found frequent opportunities of visiting my dear nannette unknown to my severe guardian at her mothers house  in one of these till then innocent excursions my ill fate contrived that colonel walter should arrive at briancon and stop at the house where i was  it was summer the evening fine and as he had no company he sauntered into the garden where nannette and i were sitting at work in an arbor  he accosted us with great politeness and i could perceive that my companion was highly pleased with his address  but the timidity natural to a person who had been brought up in so retired a manner as i had been made me wish to withdraw and notwithstanding his and nannettes solicitations to the contrary i quickly returned home possessed with the first idea i had ever felt of having done wrong  i saw by the colonels appearance that he was an officer the recollection of my father struck forcibly into my mind and i blushed with indignation to think that general dalembergs daughter had been seen in so improper a situation my pride was however consoled by thinking that i should never see him again and i determined to be more guarded in my future visits to my friend  the next morning very early nannette was at my bedside and expressed some degree of resentment at my having quitted her so abruptly the preceding night  my delicacy would not suffer me to hurt her pride by telling her my real motive for retiring i therefore said that it was owing to my apprehensions of being missed by my aunt but that i got off undiscovered and should not be so cowardly another time she seemed satisfied with this declaration and pressed me to come to her that evening she had an entire ascendant over me and notwithstanding the resolution i had made a few hours before i readily promised to attend her  i had no doubt but that the colonel would by that time have quitted briancon and i would not venture to ask a question relative to him lest it might lead her to suspect my thoughts she however talked of him incessantly said he was the handsomest and most agreeable gentleman she had ever seen told me he had invited her mother and her to supper and behaved to them as if they were princesses and added she was glad he did not live in that country as she feared another interview might engage too much of her affections she rattled away in this manner till i was summoned to attend my aunt and then made me repeat my promise of going to her the moment the old lady should retire to rest  my aunt was if possible more peevish than usual that whole day or at least her ill temper had a more than common effect upon my spirits  i longed for the evening to be released from her tyranny and to be indulged with the liberty of pouring forth my little sorrows in the bosom of my faithful nannette  the moment that my aunt had dismissed me from her chamber i flew to my appointment without waiting to alter my dress which was a perfect deshabille and found nannette in the arbor adorned with every little ornament that she was possessed of my thoughts were too much affected with the disagreeableness of my own situation to make reflections on the gaiety of her appearance  i seated myself by her leaned my head upon her bosom and with a profusion of tears told her i was no longer able to bear the misery i suffered from my aunts severity  she smiled and as i thought with an air of triumph told me that i might put an end to my misfortunes as soon as i pleased for that the colonel had assured her he had visited all the courts in europe and had never seen any thing half so beautiful as either she or i  that for her part she was resolved to try her fortune in the world forthwith and not stay moping at briancon till she grew old and ugly and that if i would accompany her she did not at all doubt of our success that i might hope to marry some reigning prince and that she might at least expect to be mistress of a dukedom  i was both shocked and surprised at hearing my friend talk in this extravagant and unusual style but before i could express my sentiments colonel walter came into the arbor dressed as if he had been going to court on a gala day  i confess i was struck nay dazzled with his appearance  from the time of my leaving turin i had never seen any man finely or elegantly dressed before i now quickly perceived the advantages that nannette received from being decked out and blushed at the inferiority of my own appearance  every human creature has i believe some sparks of vanity in their nature and this was the fatal moment when mine were first kindled a desire of outshining nannette who had a good deal disgusted me took immediate possession of my thoughts and my countenance was upon the instant lighted up with smiles  i have not a doubt but colonel walter saw through the thin veil that covered the sentiments of a creature so young and artless as i was then he at least indulged my weakness even beyond my wishes by entirely devoting his whole attention to me and totally neglecting my companion  olivia here broke off her narrative to apologize for entering into such minute circumstances which she said was meant to convince me of her sincerity as she was very certain that her weakness and innocence were the ground works of her ruin  but alas exclaimed she is there not indulgence and compassion due to uneducated uninformed fifteen  i told her that her entering into those little traits of character those fine those delicate touches marked the masters hand and were a convincing proof of the goodness both of her head and heart she complimented me on my candor and returned to her story  there had been the most elegant repast provided that briancon could afford nannette and her mother the colonel and i were all the party but i was the idol to whom all the incense was offered the good woman of the house took the ton from her guest extolled my beauty and my accomplishments as extravagantly though not so agreeably as he  nannette alone was silent  in short i became intoxicated with flattery and when the time of our parting drew near i secretly lamented at the same idea which had given me so much satisfaction the preceding night  that i should see colonel walter no more  the colonel insisted on attending me home and had ordered his chaise to convey me to my aunts  but though my vanity was flattered with this mark of attention i dared not indulge it with such an eclat however i said i would permit him to walk home with me provided nannette would accompany us  she sullenly refused  i had then no choice and the colonel and i set out together  when we were about to separate i wished him a good night and a pleasant journey  he threw himself at my feet caught hold of my hand swore i was the sovereign arbitress of his fate and that he would never leave briancon till he had obtained my hand and heart but that if i cruelly refused to accept his love he would put himself to death that instant before me  child as i was his transports terrified me i was also alarmed lest any of my aunts servants should see him so i promised if he would then retire to meet him the next evening at the inn  he made a merit of assenting to so long an absence and after a thousand protestations of the most ardent passion and as many more tender adieus he left me plunged in such a fatal yet pleasing delirium as youth and experience only can feel what an infidel should i have thought the person who had at that moment warned me to discredit the sincerity of his profession the night passed away without sleep yet i thought it short and arose next morning even with unusual vivacity  my aunts ill temper was no longer disagreeable to me my spirits were perfectly harmonized all was peace within and cheerfulness without  toward evening i began to think that time lagged heavily in its course and wished for the setting of the sun as much as a benighted traveller for its rising  at length the welcome night arrived and set me free from my restraint i ran to my toilet to endeavor to adorn the few graces that nature had lent me  in vain  confusion interrupted my efforts and haste prevented my dispatch so that in a kind of despair i threw aside my few ornaments snatched up a little straw hat and set out on my adventures in the same careless deshabille i had appeared the night before  the moment i had got out of the view of my aunts house i was met by the colonel who received me with an ecstasy that i believe was then sincere we pursued our way to the arbor where he had first seen me  on my not finding nannette there i endeavored to quit him and go in pursuit of her but he held my hand and entreated me to stay till he had revealed a secret to me which was of the utmost consequence to us both  he then assured me that nannette was not my friend and requested that i would not entrust her with the discovery he had made of his passion to me for that he feared she would betray the secret to my aunt and by that means deprive him of more than life the happiness of seeing me but that if i would be a little upon my guard she might suppose his attachment to be nothing more than common galantry which might possibly quiet the jealousy she seemed already to have conceived about it  i was shocked at the idea of deceiving or suspecting my friend yet the gloom and dissatisfaction that appeared in her behavior the night before made me too readily fall into this snare nay i joined in the deceit against myself by entreating that he would be more attentive to her and less particular to me on the present interview my motive for this request i solemnly declare was rather to prevent her being mortified as i saw she had been before than to remove any suspicion she might have entertained of me  for as i had perfectly acquiesced in the colonels honor and integrity as well as my own innocence i had not the least apprehension of any ill consequence in such a compliance  thus did this artful man disjoin me from the only person who was likely to see through his designs and could have an interest in preventing my ruin  after this discourse and abundance of protestations of the tenderest affection we joined nannette and the colonel left us for some time together to try as i presume the strength of his power over me  nannette was all gayety and showed me abundance of presents that she had received from the colonel my heart reproached me for concealing its sentiments from her but my promise to my lover had tied my tongue and the weakness and vanity of her conduct left me less reason to regret the mortification she must feel when she should know that he was seriously attached to me  this evening passed away less pleasantly than the former  nannette assumed a superiority over me in sense and judgment but attempted to soften her selfsufficience by hinting at the difference of our years and experience and though this salvo did not render her behavior less disgusting it deprived me of the power of resenting it and i retired home convinced that there were two passions awakened in my mind that i had never felt before love and hatred  nannette and the colonel accompanied me home  at parting he put a little billet into my hand which i could not refuse to accept without letting her know that it had been offered i was even then become the slave the abject slave of love and feared to offend my future tyrant the billet contained nothing more than a repetition of passionate and tender expressions with the warmest acknowledgments for the attention i had shown to his request by the prudence and propriety of my conduct and the most earnest entreaties to favor him with my company the next evening  i retired to bed and i hoped to rest but sleep was vanished and with it the charming delirium that had kept me waking the foregoing night  short was the road that i had traveled in the flowery path of pleasure yet i already found it strewed with thorns i trembled at the danger of treading it alone and lamented more piously then than ever the loss of my dear mother to whom i might have confided both my hopes and fears upon this hazardous adventure  the usual hour of my rising arrived and found my eyes unclosed and my thoughts unsettled i had neither slept nor determined on any scheme for my future conduct and when my maid came into my chamber i stepped out of bed burst into a passion of tears and said softly to myself i will not see the colonel  at least this day  i considered this determination as an amazing effort of resolution and fancied i had gained a complete victory over my infant passion the anxiety of my mind with loss of rest had brought on a slight degree of fever and the moment i quitted my aunts chamber i retired to my own threw myself on the bed and desired my maid to leave me  the poor girl who loved me tenderly was alarmed at my situation and ran directly to nannette to tell her i was ill and to beg she would come to me  she told her she was at that time so particularly engaged that it was impossible for her to stir abroad but that she would certainly see me some time in the evening  i knew nothing of this transaction and after having passed some hours in a disagreeable state of restlessness the agitation of my mind subsided and i fell asleep  some time after i was awaked by a light at my bedside and on opening my eyes i perceived nannette and colonel walter disguised in womens clothes standing by me the confusion which i felt both from my situation and his is not to be expressed  he gazed upon me with such a look of ardent tenderness as covered me with blushes i turned my eyes away begged they would withdraw into another room and promised them that as soon as i had rendered my appearance decent i would wait on them  nannette burst into a loud laugh at what she called my affected delicacy said she supposed every body was sometimes undressed and she did not see any occasion for making a difficulty about such trifles  the boldness of her manner while she spoke increased my distress and completed the dislike i had began to have conceived for her  the colonel appeared infinitely more modest in his deportment and on his making a sign to her to leave the chamber they both withdrew  the hurry of spirits which this unexpected visit had occasioned was increased by my apprehensions that some of the servants might detect the colonel under his disguise and though i knew they all loved and pitied me yet i had been taught in my infancy to dread the putting myself in the power of a servant and never to let them know a circumstance which i wished should be kept secret  the moment that i entered the room where my guests were i entreated them to leave me and mentioned my reasons for wishing them gone  nannette again made a jest of my scruples but the colonel treated them more seriously and asked my pardon for having brought me into any difficulty or distress by his indiscretion but pleaded both his and nannettes anxiety for my health and insisted on my returning with them to the inn since he was certain from my appearance that i had not any complaint to prevent me   but not to detain you madam longer with such tedious circumstances i half reluctantly complied with his entreaties and for about three weeks longer we spent every evening together almost in the same manner as the first  i had by this time lost all affection and esteem for nannette and had now no confidante or friend on earth to whom i could disclose the secrets of my heart but the single person in the world from whom i should most carefully have concealed them  when he had become quite certain of his empire over my affections he proposed my quitting briancon with him  he said my aunt was too old and perverse to be consulted on such an occasion that he neither wanted nor desired any treasure but myself for that all other considerations were below his attention  he added that his passion for me had detained him so long at briancon that he was in danger of forfeiting his commission and his honor that if i loved him i ought not to hesitate about putting myself under his protection that our interests were now become one and that he would defend me from every misfortune to the last moment of his life  i believed obeyed and repented  here she paused  for this little reflection was followed by such a passion of tears that i was obliged to restrain my curiosity as you must yours for some time  i administered drops and water to my fair biographer and to you i recommend patience till the next post for my fingers are so tired that it is as impossible for me to proceed as it is to think or write upon any other subject till i have finished this therefore not one word shall i say of myself but that i am well that i long to hear from you and that i am most affectionately yours  l barton  letter xxix lady barton to miss cleveland take notice my dear fanny that i am not used to narrative writing you must therefore make allowances for me and excuse my being sometimes too circumstantial and at others too diffuse  i can only say that my translation is what all others pretend to be a faithful one  perhaps it is so much the worse for that reason for while i am endeavoring to convey the minutest circumstances to you the elegance of expression which gave them consequence in the original is lost  but no matter for the manner of recital  if the story interests and affects you as much in the reading as it does me in the writing i shall be satisfied with my own performance  as soon as the fair olivia had regained her composure she proceeded thus  weak young and infatuated with passion as i was the colonels proposal of flying with him without marriage alarmed me and awakened all the sentiments of delicacy which are inherent to an innocent and virtuous mind yet that very delicacy prevented my having resolution to express my thoughts upon that occasion  i feared to injure his honor by seeming to doubt it  i therefore remained for some time silent upon this most interesting subject  he repeated his entreaties and pressed me to determine  i replied that i would consult my confessor he had seen the various workings of my mind and was prepared to evade all my scruples  he objected instantly to my proposal by urging that a priest would oppose my marrying an heretic and endeavor to prevent it by acquainting my aunt but told me he had a particular friend a clergyman at embrun who would make no difficulty of uniting us together  thus did this artful man lull all my doubts to rest and soothe my unwary mind into a perfect dependence upon his honor fidelity and love  the night following was fixed for our departure and in an evil and inauspicious hour i ventured on a world unknown with the most inhuman and ungenerous of his sex for my conductor  i had perhaps as little to regret at leaving briancon as any young creature who ever took so rash and unadvised a step  i wounded not the heart of a fond parent nor drew a pitying tear from any friendly eye i had no sister on whom my disgrace might be reflected nor a brother whose tenderness might lament or honor have resented my misconduct  i stood as it were alone in the universe was dear to no one but the loved object under whose protection i now had placed myself and in whom all the affections of my heart were centered  yet notwithstanding this very peculiar situation my heart trembled and my eyes overflowed when i got into the chaise and every league that we traveled the dejection of my spirits increased  for some time the colonel endeavored to dissipate my melancholy by the utmost tenderness and i affected to appear more cheerful in compliment to his attention  but he soon roused my languor into resentment by taking some unwarrantable liberties which when he found i would not suffer he attempted to excuse by saying that he had already considered me as his wife  the moment we arrived at embrun he left me in the inn to go as he said in pursuit of his friend the clergyman  he returned in about an hour with a person to perform the ceremony and we were married directly but without any other witness for i had thrown myself out of a situation to prescribe terms and must therefore have compounded for having my own scruples satisfied by a consciousness of my being his wife leaving the opinion of the world to its own charity about me  we remained two days at embrun and then set out for marseilles during our long journey my husband told me that he had some reasons for wishing to change his name and that in compliment to my christian one he would be called olivet  i readily acquiesced in whatever he thought proper without attempting to enquire into the motives of his conduct we took a house at marseilles and lived for four months in the utmost retirement and the most perfect happiness together  i never stirred out but to church or to take the air with my husband every wish of my fond heart was accomplished and i secretly rejoiced that he no longer talked of joining his regiment or returning to his native country  about that time his temper and manners began to alter he was frequently sullen and gloomy and if i attempted to enquire into the cause of this change he would answer thou art and command me to leave him  i obeyed and used to retire to my chamber and pass whole days and nights in tears  but whenever he condescended to speak to me with cheerfulness i instantly forgot his past unkindness and vainly flattered myself that it would return no more  at length with some appearance of tenderness in his manner he told me that he was under an absolute necessity of leaving me for a few months as my situation would not admit of my traveling with him from my being far advanced in my pregnancy of olivia but that he would certainly come back to me by the time i should be recovered from my lyingin and take me with him to ireland where his estate lay  all that i had ever suffered in my life seemed slight to the misery of parting with him i knelt i wept and implored him not to abandon me under such circumstances he was unmoved by my tears and entreaties and in a few days afterward quitted marseilles without even bidding me adieu  the grief i felt from this separation would i hoped have terminated my life and i fear i should have been tempted to have shortened the date of my wretched existence had not the tenderness which i felt even for my unborn babe restrained my hand from the too frequent effects of despair my situation was certainly deplorable and i then thought that my misery could not admit of addition  i have been since but too strongly convinced that there are numberless gradations in wretchedness and that i was then but entering on my novitiate  i was so totally absorbed in sorrow at being forsaken by an husband whom notwithstanding his unkindness i both respected and loved that the common concerns of life never occurred to me till my maid came to ask me for money to support my family which consisted of two maids and a man servant i started as from a dream and in an agony of grief ran to the colonels desk where i found twenty louis dors sealed up in a small box labelled thus  to olivia dalemberg this sum if used with care will bring you through your lyingin but you must immediately discharge two of your servants  j walter   here again the fair mourners tears interrupted her recital and must also put a stop to my translation for the present i wish extremely that i had finished the task i have undertaken for the sympathy between us is so strong that i feel my health wasting as her tale proceeds there is a story that some unhappy woman had blasted a great oaktree once by constantly mourning her griefs beneath its shade this fable does not appear unnatural to me under my present sensations  and yet so sweet the poison is that i would rather have listened to her doleful ditty than to all the carols of the most festive mirth  what can be the reason of so unnatural a preference how oddly compounded is the human heart but most admirably framed surely for what appears to the vulgar to be its contradictions are in the language of philosophy but its contrasts only its perfection consists in this as much as the harmony of nature depends on an opposition of elements  the heat of fire the coldness of water the heaviness of earth and the lightness of air  you may observe that i take the advantage of every opportunity for reflection in order to guard my mind as much as possible from the danger of thinking i shall leave you to explain this paradox to yourself and am my dearest friend  your truly affectionate but unhappy sister l barton  letter xxx lady barton to miss cleveland my dear fanny i am now sitting down to conclude i hope the sufferings of my fair narrator which i shall endeavor to do without any further interruption for though the listening to her story had a great deal of what i deem the luxury of woe in it i fear that this delicate sensation may have evaporated from the frequent breaks in the recital as much as the original spirit has in my translation  but at at all hazards i will now proceed  on perusing this shocking and surprising manuscript continued mrs walter my head turned round and i had just presence of mind sufficient to convey it into my pocket before i dropped upon the floor the servants heard me fall and came to my assistance  happy would it have been for me if they had spared their cruel officiousness and suffered me to have expired at that moment  my distress and despondency upon this occasion may appear unaccountable perhaps to others an husbands leaving his wife sometimes upon several occasions of business was not so uncommon a case as to have alarmed me  but there is a sort of praesentiment in the mind which often forebodes approaching ills philosophy must here be at a stand this circumstance cannot be accounted for from nature as the present situation may have no sensible connection with the future events nor can such an effect be imputed to providence neither without the impiety of supposing it capable of rendering us wretched before our time by giving us a hint of misfortunes to come without supplying us with the means of avoiding them  besides did not the address of his billet the stiling me by my own surname of dalemberg instead of walter or even that of dolivet which he had artfully prevailed on me to assume during our residence together at marseilles sufficiently evince that he no longer meant to consider me as his wife for the future this circumstance too supplied me with a strong reason also to suspect that in reality i had no legal title to that claim as the unknown person who had so clandestinely performed the ceremony might not probably have been properly qualified by the orders of any church to have officiated in the marriage rites  it was perhaps no small aggravation to my misfortunes to reflect that had not my own indiscretion aided his dishonor i should not now have been so totally abandoned unjustified unfriended and unsustained to the sport of fortune to the mercy of a malignant censorious and unpitying world  some days after this event i was lying on my bed in a state of stupid distraction when the sudden stopping of a chaise at my door roused me from my lethargy  i leaped off the bed and flew down stairs crying out he is returned my life my love my husband  but judge of my astonishment madam when i saw nannette enter the door  her face was thin and pale but she appeared farther advanced in her pregnancy than i and seemed from the expression of her countenance to be at that instant in the pangs of labor  she accosted me with the grossest abuse called me vile deceitful wretch said i had seduced her husband from her that she was come to claim him and to cover me with the infamy i deserved alternately called for her dear colonel walter and implored assistance to save here is and her infants life  amidst the variety of passions which in those moments preyed upon my wretched heart compassion was the strongest i had her immediately conveyed to my chamber and placed in my own bed i sent for the bed assistance that could be had and in a few hours she was delivered of a son who lived but three days the agitations of her mind brought on a violent fever but even in her ravings she continued to accuse me as the sole cause of all her sufferings and uttered the most vehement imprecations against me  from the moment of nannettes arrival i could perceive that my servants treated me with less respect than usual they doubtless believed her story and thought that my receiving her into my house was at once a proof both of my guilt and fear  the physician and apothecary who attended her divulged the tale abroad and i was looked upon by the whole city of marseilles as one of the most abandoned wretches  i know nothing that creates such an irksome sensation in the mind as imputed guilt but the very delicacy that makes us feel it most serves to restrain us from entering into a vindication as this would be to admit it possible at least it might be true  under such a difficulty i then labored and this nicety supported by the natural courage of innocence inclined me rather to acquiesce in the censure than engage in so public a justification of myself as this unhappy womans charge against me seemed to require and she was not herself at that time in a fit condition either of mind or body to have listened to my defense  nannettesdelirium continued about fifteen days during which time the miserable pittance that colonel walter had left me was exhausted and i was seized with the pains of labor without being mistress of a single livre or credit in the place death was at that time the supreme object of my wishes yet in regard to my dear babe that now approached the light i sent for my confessor related to him every circumstance that i have repeated to you implored his protection for the unborn innocent and put a shagreen case which contained the portraits of both my parents with some jewels into his hands which had been bequeathed me by my dear mother on her death bed and which i had ever since preserved as a relic with the most pure devotion  truth generally affords conviction to an ingenuous mind the good father heard my story believed it pitied my distress and gave me every consolation that my wretched state could admit of by administering the rites of the church and assuring me in the most solemn manner that he would take the utmost care of my child in case it should survive its unhappy mother i likewise recommended nannette to his humanity  he promised that while she remained ill all her wants should be supplied and if she recovered he would furnish her with the means of returning home again to her mother  peace once more took possession of my breast and a thorough resignation to the will of heaven triumphed for a while over that distracting inquietude which had well nigh destroyed both my mind and body  but the arrow of incurable affliction was still lodged in my heart and the temporary calm that i then enjoyed was occasioned rather by my weakness than my strength  it pleased heaven that i was soon and safely delivered of my beloved olivia and from the moment of her birth all selfish apprehensions vanished i no longer felt a pang but for her and never ceased lamenting her being involved in the miseries of her mother though doting on her as i did i a thousand times wished she had been born of any other parent and yet am certain i would not have parted with her to a queen  in about ten days after i was brought to bed the good father who had supplied me with every necessary and visited me constantly came into my chamber with an unusual vivacity in his looks  be of good cheer madam said he providence never forsakes the virtuous and patient sufferer  heaven has been pleased through my weak endeavors to raise you up a friend who is at once inclined and capable of relieving you from your distress and establishing a certain supply for your future competence  madame de fribourg will be here in a few minutes and is coming to take you under her roof and protection but before it is possible for you to remove there i will inform you how this instance of good fortune has been brought about and furnish you with some instructions that may conduce toward rendering you agreeable to your patroness  but while he was yet speaking the marchioness de fribourg entered and interrupted him  i have already told you that i had lodged nannette in my own chamber and was of course obliged to lyein in my maids room  the first words the marchioness uttered were heavens what a place for the child of my friend my dear madame dalemberg she stepped forward and embraced me then raised her glass to her eye and surveyed me with the most critical and distressing attention i was so extremely confused both by the suddenness and manner of her entering and address that i could neither speak nor move  from the death of that dear mother she mentioned i had never seen a woman that was capable of inspiring me with respect or awe before  her appearance commanded both  a sudden gush of tears relieved me for a moment and seemed to soften the farouche demeanor of my future benefactress  she quickly made an apology for having mentioned my mother seated herself by me laid aside her glass and took my hand with infinite grace but no softness  the marchioness was about fifty years old she was uncommonly tall had been remarkably handsome her eyes large black and piercing but the whole contour of her countenance was rather hard than pleasing  there was an air of fierte expressed throughout her whole appearance that inclined you at first sight rather to fear than love her  she told me that my confessor who was also here is had informed her of my distress but that chance had brought her acquainted with my being the daughter of her friend that as such i might depend on her good offices and regard and added that she hoped i should be ready to set out with her in a few days for paris where she was then going and that she would order her woman to provide a proper nurse to leave my child with  the idea of parting with my daughter shocked me extremely  i fell at her feet and as if she had been the arbitress of my fate implored her not to divide me from my child said that this infant was now the only blessing i possessed in life and that nothing but death or her happiness should ever part us  she gazed at me with a mixture of surprise and contempt and said that if pere guillaume had informed her i was such a pretty simpleton she would have saved me and herself the trouble of a visit but that she believed there was something contagious in folly since she found herself inclined to comply with my absurd request though she detested children but that her hotel at paris being large enough to prevent her hearing it squall i might bring the brat with me provided i did not insist on her being plagued with it during our journey  i was transported with even this uncouth and forced permission i kissed her hand and bathed it with my tears told her she had rendered me extremely happy and that i would endeavor to deserve her indulgence by every mark of gratitude and attention in my power she seemed pleased and somewhat affected and at quitting me she gave me a purse of fifty louisdors bid me prepare for my journey by that day sennight said she would not desire me to come to her house at marseilles because she meant to surprise her husband by finding me in her suite without his knowledge and desired that i might still retain the name of dolivet  this was the most sudden transition i had ever experienced from sorrow to joy and though i could not possibly know what sort of state i was going to enter into yet i thought any change must be for the better  it was also the first time i had ever had any thing like business to transact in my life and the having it in my power to discharge my debts and servants composed my mind into a state of the most pleasing tranquillity imaginable  nannette however remained still a weight upon my spirits in addition to that misfortune that then did and ever will oppress them  in a short time after the marchioness had left me the good father guillaume returned he brought with him the shagreen case which i had entrusted him with the contents untouched except a diamond ring which he had been obliged to dispose of to answer the expenses of my family and delivered me twelve louis dors the remainder of thirty he had sold it for  the sight of my dear parents pictures affected me extremely i kissed and bathed them with my tears and most piously thanked my good patroness in my heart for this article of her bounty more than all the rest that she had saved me from the misery of parting with those dear remains  father guillaume told me that he had related my story to madame de fribourg without mentioning who i was and showed her the jewels in hopes that she would purchase them which she refused but the moment she beheld the portraits she snatched up one of them exclaiming with surprise and joy this this is  was  my near relation and my dearest friend olivia dalemberg upon which he acquainted her with my name and family and she promised on the instant to take care of me but insisted on his not informing me that she had acknowledged any manner of affinity between us  he then gave me the marchionesss character and history in a few words  pride vanity an insatiable desire of admiration and a fondness for play he said were her great foibles but that she was friendly generous and humane when these virtues did not interfere with her passions  he said she had been married young to the marquis de fribourg that he had been dead about ten years and had left her immensely rich that she had since married monsieur de lovaine a young soldier of fortune who treated her very cavalierly and of whom she was extravagantly fond and jealous  he told me that he had furnished me with this little charte du pais in hopes i should be able to steer my course by it to safety and happiness  he then informed me that he had written to a friend of his in ireland to inquire after colonel walter but that as i had not been able to ascertain even the name of the province where his fortune lay it was possible nay probable from the dissoluteness of his character that i might never see or hear of him again  he entreated me therefore to strive wholly to forget him and devote my whole attention to the cultivation of the marchionesss friendship and the education of my child  he promised to remember me in his prayers and to favor me with his advice by letter then took a most affectionate leave of me as he was obliged to quit marseilles for a few days to perform some business by command of his superior  i had not seen nannette from the time of my being taken ill but as i knew she was recovering though slowly i fancied i was then able to bear an interview with her and acquaint her with my design of quitting marseilles i meant to offer her every assistance in my power and take leave of her i hoped for life  i accordingly proceeded to her chamber  but no words can express the surprise and horror that affected me at seeing her  her whole frame was convulsed and every feature distorted and enlarged the moment she beheld me she seemed to acquire new strength and endeavored to revile me with as much bitterness as when she arrived first at marseilles  she had however no longer the power of raising any passion in me but pity  i said every thing that was possible to calm her mind assured her i had never knowingly injured her and that i had certainly been as much if not more imposed on and deceived by colonel walter than herself  i then proceeded to relate with the utmost exactness the colonels whole behavior from his first meeting to his quitting me during the recital of which she wept often her countenance became more placid and composed and when i had finished my story she asked my pardon a thousand times for the injury she had done me and confessed i was much more to be pitied than herself on account of my youth and inexperience  she confessed too that the formalities of marriage had never passed between them but showed me a paper he had given her by which he had engaged to acknowledge her as his wife at some future era and with regard to the marked attention which he had shown to me he assured her he meant nothing more by it than merely to deceive her mother  and in order to carry on the plot said he was obliged to spend a few weeks at embrun upon a particular business and desired her to hold herself in readiness to come off to him there at a minutes warning on a summons which he promised to send her from thence  matters being thus settled between them her mind she said was quite at ease on his departure  till she heard of my elopement with him the morning after it happened which threw her into a state of distraction for several months but not hearing from him all that time and beginning at last to apprehend that her situation would quickly discover her misconduct and cover her with infamy she determined to follow him to embrun and as she could not suppose that he had ventured to have entered into firmer engagements with me than he had already done with her she considered herself as having a prior right to the title of his wife and resolved to assert her claim  she then took a small sum of money from her mother to whom at length she had revealed the secret and came off post to embrun as it had been known that we had taken that route but upon missing us there she had with almost incredible difficulty and after numberless delays attended by illness and fatigue on the way traced us to marseilles where she acknowledged that she owed her life to my unmerited humanity  she then poured forth many severe excecrations against colonel walter said she would not return to briancon but if she should recover would pursue him all over the world till she had received satisfaction at least in revenge for his perjured faith and villainy  she told me that my aunt had not expressed either rage or surprise at my going off but seemed rather to be sufficiently consoled for my loss by being freed from the expense of my future maintenance  there is a material difference between the belief and certainty of a fact  and though i had hitherto supposed that her insensibility might have prevented her from grieving at the impropriety of my conduct or the misfortunes which might probably attend it i could not bear to be convinced of my own insignificance by her inhumanity  i felt humbled and mortified at this account as if i had received some fresh injury  before i knew any thing of madame de fribourg i had many times thought of returning to briancon of throwing myself at my only surviving parents feet and of endeavoring to obtain her pardon for my offending self and her protection for my unoffending child  but now the idea vanished like a dream and i thought of no other resource but the marchionesss kindness  after having discharged all my little debts i had about thirteen louisdors left and the day before i quitted marseilles i took leave of nannette and presented her with ten of them i begged to hear from her and left a line recommending her to the care of the good father guilaume and we parted from each other with all the tokens and feelings of revived friendship  when the marchionesss equipage stopped at my door i was ready to step into it and my little girl was consigned to the care of her woman who traveled in a chaise behind us  madame de fribourg accosted me with great good humor and praised my exactness in not keeping her waiting the instant i opened my lips to reply to her politeness monsieur de lovain lifted up his eyelids which had been closed before and seemed to awake from a profound slumber he gazed at me with an expression of surprise in his look and threw me into as much confusion as his lady had done on out first interview  from that moment he became lively and so perfectly polite and attentive to the marchioness that not only she but i was charmed with his behavior and our long journey was rendered perfectly agreeable by the pleasing concord that appeared between as i then thought this happy pair  on our arrival at paris the marchioness allotted me an apartment in her hotel and ordered two of her women to attend particularly on me and my child she requested that i would get the better of my air triste and appointed a musicmaster and a dancing master to instruct and fashion me  letter xxxi lady barton to miss cleveland southfield as i have now happily set the fair narrator down safe at the hotel de fribourg you will give us both leave to rest ourselves a little for though i am still you perceive running on yet i find that a change of subjects relieves the fatigue of writing  while she was relating her story i felt infinitely more than you can possibly do in reading it the seeing the very object of distress before us is a vast improvement to the pathetic besides that along with my compassion toward her and my resentment against her husband there was mixed up a certain sensation of horror at being lodged under the roof of such a villain  i honor shakespeare
