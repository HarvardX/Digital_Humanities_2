two great questions considered i what is the obligation of parliaments to the addresses or petitions of the people and what the duty of the addressers ii whether the obligation of the covenant or other national engagements is concerned in the treaty of union being a sixth essay at removing national prejudices against the union  printed in the year mdccvii  two great questions considered etc i thought at the writing each of these papers that the part before me would be the last and have been always cautious of crowding the reader of these essays with too many subjects  but every day brings with it new occasions of debate and it is in vain for me to resolve upon silence unless i will abandone truth and see it every day insulted with errors both in practice and in opinion  i have stood still and seen the parliament thronged with addresses or petitions and some of them in an unusual style a style parliaments in other kingdoms resent with more severity a great deal i have seen authority insulted her majesty in the person of her representative very ill treated and all past over with lenity and gentleness  to this i have thought my self obliged to say nothing as not in my sphere his grace the high commissioner and the parliament kno how to resent and when to resent and it is not my business to presume to direct  but after all this i cannot but take notice of the dialect of some people here which to me is very strange who have been talking very confidently of going to ask the parliament for an answer to their addresses  this in english i take to be equivalent to calling the parliament to account and some gentlemen have as good as called it so  indeed their resolution has not been equal to their project and they have not yet thought fit to put their schemes in practice but i thought it necessary for the information of those who pretend to justify such a method to examine a little the nature right and obligation of adressing or petitioning our superiors and state the point of duty between both addressers and the persons addressed and this is the first article i shall enter upon in this essay  of petitioning parliaments and the duty in that case both of parliament and people as this is a nicer subject than ordinary and he that writes upon it may easily be misunderstood so i desire a little to explain my self before i proceed to the particulars  and first i desire to note that i shall not distinguish in this discourse between addressing and petitioning not but that there are essential differences between them and which used to be observed by the people petitioning being applied to requests only and addressing to every thing congratulating or otherwise summary in representing the subject it is upon  but custom has now brought these things together the address is called a petition and the petition an address and as the age makes no distinction neither do i and therefore i desire through out this paper to be understood promiscuously of both    dly i note here that i shall in no wise dispute whether it be lawful upon all occasions for the people to address to or petition the parliament  i shall take it for granted and agree with any body in this that it is the undoubted right of the people of any free nation but particularly of the three kingdoms of scotland england and ireland to present their grievances to their respective authorities be it king or parliament or both and to do it by petition address or any other way within the limited prescription of the law  when these things by way of note are first granted i know nothing more in the way of my discourse but to come directly to the subject of petitioning or addressing of parliaments and in this it is necessary to consider   the nature of petitioning or addressing   the manner of presenting   the duty of the persons addressed to   the duty of the persons addressing     the nature of addressing or petitioning and me thinks i need go no further than the very words themselves which without troubling my self to dive into their etymologies and original do plainly and expressly signify the posture of supplicants a petition is in its nature a prayer a begging or entreating and let the subject of the petition be never so much matter of right it is by the nature of the thing submitted to the pleasure of the persons petitioned either when to grant it or in such manner as they shall see meet or not to grant it at all  i confess we have of late seen different steps taken in this case and some gentlemen are pleased to tell us of addresses to the parliament commanding them etc others in their addresses come with a we hope and confidently expect etc of which by it self  however these gentlemen think of their method i must take the liberty to tell such if they will act fairly and give every thing its proper style they should call such things representations or remonstrances not addresses or petitions  and therefore in our own memories when the people of scotland applied themselves to the late king william for the establishment of their privileges they did not call it an address or a petition but a claim of right  to petition or address must certainly acknowledge a right in the persons addressed to either to grant or not to grant the thing addressed for referring the manner and season of granting to them and contents it self with having laid the request before them  all other or further pursuing the subject is tumultuary and tends to riot and disorder the thing ceases then to be an address or a petition and becomes a demand a force or threatening of force which in its nature is absolutely destructive of the very being and substance of government tends to all manner of disorders and cannot be called petitioning  and therefore that reverend divine that lately preached in the new kirk in this city speaking of this very thing had this most pertinent expression that when he considered some of the addresses here they had on the frontispiece the words an humble petition but if they were to correspond with the substance they should have been styled a bold declaration in opposition to authority and that he could not understand the meaning of a petition or address sword in hand  no truly nor can any man else understand it by the words for petition and sword in hand are two contraries that do not illustrate but really destroy one another  in short to address or petition is to pray to desire and to submit to the wisdom and authority of the person you petition or address to for the granting or not granting the request all that goes beyond this is excentrick remote and inconsistent not only with the due respect of subjects to authority but with the nature and substance of the thing it self and indeed ought not to go by the name of address or petition  when the flemings in the time of philip the ii made the famous petition to the lady infanta then governess of the spanish netherlands  tho they petitioned for their native right and liberty of religion yet they voluntarily took upon them the name of geux or beggars and were called so on both sides signifying that though it was really their right they demanded yet while they did it by way of petition it ought to be agreeable to the nature of a petition viz as a prayer or humble request i omit the application of this part till the last and proceed to examine    the manner of petitioning this respects the words of the petition and the method of petitioning  as to the words or terms of the petition as every sermon ought to conform to the text every book to its title every application to the doctrine so every such application to authority ought to conform to the title which always bears the term humble in the front of it an humble address or an humble petition and the like  i confess there is room for reflection enough here where humility takes up the title and all manner of insolences scandals reproaches and unjust assertions fill up the bodies of addresses and petitions are made in the language of the spanish beggars who they say beg an alms with the hat in one hand and the sword in the other  what else can we say of the addressers that tell the parliament they are acting contrary to the fundamental rights of the nation that their votes are inconsistent with the constitution of scotland enslaving them to england and surrendering the liberties and freedoms of the scots nation in plain words betraying their native country to the english and destroying that foundation which is their duty to preserve and defend and the like  in all nations such addressings have been esteemed contrary to the duty of subjects contrary to the nature of addressing and contrary to the dignity of authority and therefore the parliament of england in the case of the famous kentish petition showed their resentment not at petitioning in general for that every body allowed was the privilege of the subject but at the manner or expression the words of which were that they would turn their humble addresses into bills of supply now though it was no breach of duty to petition the parliament to supply the kings wants for the public good yet in this particular turn the parliament thought the petitioners took upon them to reproach the house with trifling their time away in complements and addresses when the necessity of the nation called for supplying the public for action  this as out of the sphere of a petition they resented and therefore voted it scandalous insolent and seditious send for the persons who presented it in custody and afterward committed them to the gate house though gentlemen of the best quality in their country  i am not arguing from hence what should be done here the government here is gentle mild and bear a great deal but they ought not to have the more insult put upon them for that very reason  the manner or method of a petition ought to correspond with its title be humble the expression modest the diction decent soft and void of every thing disrespectful unmannerly and much less untrue i mean the language of it  as to the manner of delivery this ought to be still more courteously managed and to suit first the customs of the place in the case of petitions secondly the persons petitioning and thirdly the persons who are petitioned or addressed to  the decency due to government and especially to the authority of parliament requires all possible respect as it is the supreme authority of the nation the body clothed with the sanction of legislature on one hand and sovereign judicature on the other  an humble petition and humbly presented is without doubt the just debt of applying to this power  all manner of tumultuous assemblings all manner of threatening appearances or speeches are in this case scandalous insolent and seditious to lead direct command much less threaten and speak roughly to them is an insolence destructive to the very nature of government and the distance of subjects  what though they are the servants of the state and accountable for justice truth and liberty yet are they not subjected to the insults of the subject in the execution of their great trust  the authority they exercise is sacred and ought not to be treated with disrespect or contempt  the long disputed case of their being accountable never amounted to more than that they are accountable in conscience honor and interest but it remains to prove that ever any member representing his country can be called to account in any court for things done in parliament either in this kingdom or in england if they were no man would serve his country at that price  the method of petitioning therefore in your neighboring kingdom is thus far confined by law to prevent all manner of tumultuous assemblies that not more than five persons can appear at the presenting any petition be the subject of it of never so public a nature and this has effectually prevented the great mischiefs of riotous petitioning which in their turn have proved pernicious both to government and to people in england and must have ill consequences in any country where such exorbitances are unrestrained  but say the objectors against this doctrine have we committed all our power to our representatives and is it in their power to ruin us all this brings me to the third head    of the duty of the petitioned and here i lay some heads down for others to enlarge upon for in this small tract i have not room   all our civil rights are not subjected no not to parliament as particularly it is not in their power to take away the right of being represented though without doubt it is in their power to enlarge or contract settle and limit the number of the representatives and the space of the countries they shall represent and whereas some infer from hence that then they may resolve the whole representative into a single person and they think they have a mighty victory in this  i answer  every part of the kingdom which has been a separate government must be separately represented because its right of being represented began in its separate state and cannot be taken away  but yet every kingdom that by themselves or their representatives consent even to suspend their being represented at all may doubtless do it for a time tho it cannot be for their posterity because the right of being represetned descends with the land and the freeholder himself cannot give it away charters burghs or corporations may be forfeited and disfranchised but the freehold land shall ever entitle the possessor to a right of being represented   according to mr hodges  the representative has all the right and power of the freeholder p  and if so then he has this authority much more and may give away all but i dare not run that length   a representative cannot bind conscience or oblige in contradiction to the laws of god  all their votes all their authority ceases when once they contraveen the express laws of god and in that case their power is ipso facto dissolved and they cease to be a legislature in so far only as they act against or in opposition to the divine law the apostles question in that case strongly implying the negation  whether it be lawful to obey god rather than man judge ye   nor can they make laws against nature or reason but in every thing else they have the full legislative and judicature committed to them and it can not be rational to subject them to the tumultuous authority of their constituents  i know it is affirmed here that the barons have a right if they please to decline a representative and come up and sit in person as the peers do  whether they have such a right or no is not my business to debate here but i will offer one negative to such an absurd notion that i believe will serve to the present case viz that they cannot have such a right now for this current parliament they having by their election already concluded themselves for this time if ever they have such a right which nevertheless i do not grant it must be when a new parliament is to be chosen  but the case for this parliament is determined and cannot be altered  but how far then is a parliament obliged by the addresses of the heretors or constituents and what is their duty in such cases for this is the grand question before us  i answer addresses if decently worded dutifully with respect to authority presented and significant in their nature ought to be received and in this part i must own the parliament of scotland have been over and above regardful of their duty for that they have received such addresses containing such insulting of their authority such arraigning their proceedings such leading their voices such limiting their legal power and such indecent and disrespectful treating their persons as no subject in these ages have ever that i remember done with impunity in any nation but this  and therefore i think with submission no objection will ly against them on that score     nor is it the duty of representatives to receive only the addresses of the subjects but indeed they seem to me to owe a reading and if the substance require it to consider and debate the matters laid before them in it if any man shall ask so weak a question as who shall be judge whether the substance require their debates or no the nature of debating answers that for they can debate upon nothing else but the merits of the petition and if they find it frivolous or vexatious without question they may either lay it asleep in the house by the still voice of a general neglect or cast it back with resentment as the case in their opinion deserves if this be not in their choice then it is no more an address or petition but a precept or mandamus the people signing it are no more addressers petitioners or desirers but directors and preceptors and the whole scale of order inverts to democracy and confusion    doubtless and i believe any member of parliament will allow me this if the parliament in case of an address presented received and considered find matter of right in it the subjects grievances truly represented and the demand just if an oppression to be remedied if injurious encroachments on right and property are to be removed if any thing previous be there laid before them in which they see the subject injured and that it is in their power to right him tho the addresser be never so mean so low or so despicable and tho the injury were backed with never so much power they are bound in duty in conscience and in regard to the trust committed to them to answer the said request redress right restore and help the injured people whose rights they are entrusted to protect and defend  i shall not enlarge on the duty of a representative i see no members here stand in need of my weak instructions or that want to be put in mind of their duty to their country    of the duty of petitioners i come now to the last article and the main occasion of this tract the duty of persons addressing or petitioning for without question there is a duty due there too how negligent soever people are of it and how willing soever some are to forget the obligation  and here i must begin with negatives and i cannot but put you in mind of the honest minister at the new kirk who told ye that he did not understand addressing to authority with sword in hand this as that gentleman very well said is rather a bold declaration than an humble address  if people will address  let them do it like an address if they will petition let it be a petition  on the other hand if they will remonstrate let them remonstrate and be plain if they have reason and justice no doubt the parliament will hear them both ways but to remonstrate and address both in a breath that is like the french king making war while he gives peace to europe to have it be an humble address in the title and a bold declaration in the body of the paper this is neither peace nor war it looks no way and every way all together in short it is neither honest nor legal it is not legal because it is against government and does not correspond with lawful authority and it is not honest because it does not correspond with it self it calls it self one thing and really is another it has a silken face and a steely heart a smile on the brow and a grin in the thought it is unjust and unfair  if you will be called addressers or petitioners you must act as such or else it is honester to quit the title  the duty of addressers in the next place is to leave the matter of their addresses to the consideration of the persons addressed or petitioned and to acquiesce in their determination or judgment an address that will have no nay is no more an address but as i said before a precept and direction  to such for such i find here i cannot but speak a word by way of direction  at the same time that you plead for a right of petitioning i hope you do not demand a right or by it mean a right of directing  i confess i am at some loss to know how some gentlemen who addressed the present parliament would have us to understand these words we hope and confidently expect words frequently used in some addresses i have seen here whether they really have any confidence in the parliament or no i cannot tell it is my opinion they have enough in the expression  a right of petitioning i agree is undoubted but what authority these gentlemen will bring for a right to oblige the parliament to follow their directions i cannot imagine any more than i can how they would properly be called a parliament or representative if that power were left in the persons they represent  as therefore i would by no means lessen the authority of the people in the reserves of right left them and which are not committed to the representatives so i would by no means reduce parliaments to mobs and rabbles and make them pay their homage every day to the absolute directions of their constituents this were indeed to sacrifice to our sovereign lord the people this were to level the legislators as a late author has it to the will and humor of the people state of the controversy page   this were to make the members representatives and the mob be the parliament god deliver this nation from the confusion of such a constitution and the consequences of such kind of doings  the people without doubt have committed to their representatives the management of all their civil affairs the power of making explaining amending executing and repealing laws  in these terms are concluded all the trusts that are contained in life limb property and estate  this management extends to subjecting life and estate to punishment for crimes stating protection to property and administration of justice regulating altering limiting and declaring all things belonging to government succession constitution and executive power  in all these things you are to acquiesce and submit to the determination of the representatives you mark that your selves having constituted and appointed them by a voluntary legal choice your deputies your plenipotentiaries to concert settle and establish all these things in your behalf  if your nearest relations break the laws they make you follow them to the gibbet with regret and lamentations at the misfortune in committing the crime but no complaint at the makers of the law ye acquiesce in that as the act and deed of the parliament  it is hard we should acquiesce in some things and scruple others since their authority is equal in all  what has been said on this part will however bear this just inference and it is one of the best uses i can turn the discourse to viz  this doctrine quite overthrows the legality of people first addressing and then assembling to make an open demand of an answer or what else they please to call it to their address  and those gentlemen that find fault with the late proclamation for preventing such assembling as illegal can never defend the legality of their part to come in a body as some people call it expecting therefore the more respect this can have no other nor better construction than to say we will make such an appearance as shall awe the parliament by our numbers to grant our demands  i would not be a forward censurer of the designs of any body further than reason justifies but i cannot see it will bear any other construction and if not then it is directly contrary to the very nature of addressing as well as to the duty and deference owing to parliamentary authority  what can the meaning of number be but strength what their appearing but force the government therefore are highly justified in exerting the needful authority entrusted to them for that end in preventing the early beginnings of those assemblies that contrary to the nature and true meaning of addressers designed to have awed or influenced the parliament in their appearance  those gentlemen who ever they are that contrived that design were in my opinion strangely mistaken in their measures and have something to account for to their discretion if they had really a design to have insulted the parliament for they could not but imagine that an attempt of drawing together undiscerned must be impossible in a city no bigger than this and in a government that god be praised has their eyes about them  nor could they expect but at the first appearance of a concourse of strangers the town would be alarmed their design be discovered and consequently prevented  but i must own they made amends for their want of forecast in the design by the discretion of laying it aside at last and not ruining themselves and their friends upon the certain destruction of an impracticable attempt and i doubt not they will be sensible by this time that they were in the wrong  but this by the way that part i am upon is in short thus all tumultuary parts of management in matters of addressing or petitioning parliaments or governors is not contrary to the laws only but contrary to the nature of addressing contrary to the duty of subjects and ought rather to be called bold declarations in opposition to legal authority  ii of the obligation of national oaths this is a new point and if handled in a way that may seem something new the gentlemen concerned will i hope not be under any surprise since it will only discover that some people raised their scruples more for want of due enquiry than from the real difficulty of the question  most people who have entered upon this article have amused us with the enquiries into the extent of the oaths and obligations which this nation lies under and with debating how far they are or are not binding to the posterity of those that took them and these enquiries have one peculiar which seems very natural to them scilicet to leave people as much or more in the dark than they found them  the various opinions and weak arguments on both sides entangle the subject and serve only to leave it a doubtful point which no body can unravel and this is what the enemies of the truth aim at and are very well satisfied with and indeed it answers their end but too well  the broachers of opinions in the world have in all ages fled to this refuge viz when strength of reasoning would not support their errors they struggle to cloud the argument with abstrufe conjectures ambiguous interpretations dark and difficult suggestions and any thing that may render the subject mysterious for that if once the doctrine has but difficulty enough in it to divide the opinions of men and have some be of one mind and some of another in the matter they gain the point and it is odd but some espouse it be the error never so gross  to avoid this evil in the case in hand to take from the adversary the advantage of making this a moot point and that leaving people doubting and unsatisfied they may bring them out of love with the occasion i shall come quite another way and i hope a nearer way to the truth  to state the question right is the way to make this plain truth yet plainer and i think it lies as follows  there are national obligations which have been taken in scotland either by us our fathers and which we hold our selves equally bound to  which in their nature interfere with our incorporating with england in the present proposed union  that this is the true state of the question i could prove from too many of the weak and ill tempered arguments which some people have made use of in public to defend their clamours at the treaty and which i only conceal because i would not record the folly of the persons who i hope may in time come to be better informed and i am unwilling to leave them any thing to blush at  but to put my argument right i must back it with one authentic quotation viz out of the so well known address of the presbytery of hamilton to the parliament a thing i shall have occasion to mention again in the course of this tract the words are thus  but that which more especially obliges us in duty and conscience as ministers of the gospel of peace most humbly to interpose with your grace and lordships is the lamentable and distracted state of the kingdom and particularly the people under our pastoral charge from the sad apprehension they have of the woeful consequences of such an union to their liberties civil and religious  and that it cannot be entered into by the nation in the terms without incurring the guilt of national perjury  this is plain to my purpose and justifies my proposed state of the question  i shall not spend the readers time here to state the obligations nor shall i repeat the oaths or covenants which are here meant further than to lay it down just as the gentlemen themselves allege viz that having taken an oath or entered into a solemn engagement either they or their fathers for that they say is all one obliging themselves as far as shall be in their power to support and maintain the reformation of religion against all error or novations whatsoever together with an obligation to maintain and defend the kings person the laws and parliamentary authority all the lawful jurisdictions etc as may be seen at large in the national confession  this they say obliges them to have no union with a nation professing contrary to this principle much less with a nation whose church is established upon that very episcopacy which they think themselves obliged by their oath and in both their national and church capacity to abolish and pull down  then as to civil matters they are obliged they say by this oath to maintain and defend the parliament government and sovereignty of scotland and the like which they apprehend they do not do by the union  i will do the gentlemen that justice to acknowledge that they begin very much to decline the last objection being as they search into it further and further convinced of the weakness of that part  and especially as a thing they are not so solicitous about  but as to the first they seem very positive and warm in the case  i shall not lay the stress of this matter where these people do and therefore the triumph they make over those that argue against the obligation of national oaths on the posterity of the people taking them shall stand them in no stead here for i will readily grant them for argument sake whether i believe it or no is not material that the national oaths or covenant or both which their fathers took has all that obligation they allege let that also be what it will on us their children that they having eaten these sour grapes our teeth are set on edge by them and that by no shift evasion subterfuge or whatever contrivance we can be cleared of the bond  having granted this i hope no man will take it ill if i very narrowly search all the unhappy policies of this perverse generation to bring us in bound by these national obligations not to unite with england  it is not at all to the present purpose whether we are bound by these oaths but whether do these oaths prevent our joining with england in the terms of the union and whether it be true or no as is quoted from the presbytery of hamilton that it cannot be entered into without incurring the guilt of national perjury  to enquire directly into this  it will be necessary to distinguish here the obligation of the oath and the substance of the treaty of union  the obligation is against the invasions of error and for preserving the purity of religion it is an oath to maintain and defend the presbyterian government and discipline of the church this i take to be a fair abstract of it  now against this let us set the treaty and see what are the stipulations between the two kingdoms and without running through the articles they consist in general heads of agreement and mutual coalition in matters of civil government communication of privileges regulations of state and postulata of trade  and pray gentlemen take it along with you there is not in the treaty one word of the things contained in the oaths we are upon nor are any of the heads of those oaths concerned here of which presently  next let us distinguish here of the subjects of these oaths on one hand and the subjects of the treaty on the other hand and the several capacities of either as they respect the case in hand and here we shall find them also as distinct and unconcerned as if they were not the same persons  the subjects of the oaths are the people of scotland nationally considered in their ecclesiastic capacity or the people of scotland in their religious capacity as presbyterians reformed from popery and prelacy and erected in a national church which they engage solemnly to defend and i would have them defend it to the end of the world  the subjects of the treaty of union are the people of scotland in their politic capacity as a government under a limited monarchy a queen reigning vested with a legal undoubted and undisputed right a parliament representing sitting and acting by law and both together legally and beyond the power of cavil vested with right and authority to debate of and determine every thing which may be for the public good of the body to be governed and which relates to civil right law justice and policy  that to distinguish the people of scotland thus in their several capacities politic and religious is just and to the purpose will easily appear in that they are distinguished so already both in the nature of the thing and in the different pacts of government  the government of the state including all the latter branch of the above distinction is entirely separate from unconcerned with has no influence upon nor is at all influenced by the government of the church which is the former branch of the said distinction the parliament represents the people in their civil capacity the church has no voice in the election nor is at all represented there nor is any thing cognizable there relating to the religious capacity of any individual subject of scotland the civil government has indeed the ecclesiastic in its protection and it is its duty to defend and support it  but even the queen and parliament cannot no not by law dethrone the power and constitution of the church of scotland as presbyterian  because it will for ever be just as is expressed in the claim of right that the people ought to have that religion established which is their own choice   nor are they distinct in the government only but in the very persons governing the people of scotland in their civil capacities are governed by the queen and the laws justice and legislature is lodged in the queen and the parliament and all men are subject to it  the people of scotland in their religious capacity are governed by the ecclesiastic authority of session presbytery synod and assembly and to these even the sovereign and parliament in their ecclesiastic and separate capacity are pleased to be subject  thus i defend the distinction as to the subjects of the respective cases before us  things thus set clear of one another and examined apart i must confess to me it is one of the profoundest mysteries in nature and i can see no shadow of a discovery how the union of two nations in their mere civil and politic concerns can affect their religious concern  but to come nearer yet  these things are not only divided and distinguished in their own nature but they are expressly distinguished in the treaty it self which professes to unite the two kingdoms in their civil and politic capacity as to economy government interest and commerce but expressly reserves to each the separate state and absolute independency of all their religious affairs  to make this more clear care was taken to remove all manner of jealousies on either hand by expressly providing limiting and forbidding that the commissioners on either side should have any authority to treat of matters relating to the church  the reason was plain the union was not concerned in it the churches in either kingdom were settled fixed and established and were so to remain they were not to unite or to treat about uniting the business of the union is not to bring them together but to keep them asunder not to bring them into one government but to secure them in their being two  the church of scotland or the people of scotland in their religious capacity have no concern in the treaty they are not at all uniting the pale of distinction is as firm and if i may say it the church of scotland better secured and better fixed as to humane power than ever it was before having the faith of a treaty perhaps more solemn than ever was yet made in the world to support her and all the men of honesty and principle in the whole island to support and defend to recognize and see to the execution of that treaty  if then the independency of the religious government in scotland be thus reserved and secured i cannot see which way the oaths or covenants of the people of scotland in religious matters are any way infringed because indeed not any way concerned in or subjected to any article of the treaty  the first objection i meet with here is yet we are subjected to the legislation of bishops  to this much might be said as that they are barons and vote in the house of lords as such but exercise no spiritual authority there and i do not see but if an ecclesiastic in scotland either by blood came to be a peer or by vote was chosen a representative in scotland he might sit in parliament too but i wave that my direct answer here is   you as a church have no hand in the placing them there for in your ecclesiastic capacity you have no concern in the union at all nor the church of england neither   to clear your consciences from the guilt and your selves from the subjection you protest against your being subjected in any religious matters to their vote   and let what pretenses so ever be made here i see no room for any question whether this does not effectually clear you since you have neither agency in the fact nor are subjected to the consequences how then can the oath be affected here    but say some gentlemen more willing to be scrupulous than to be answered we are bound as far as lies in us to pull down prelacy even in england  this is a wild objection i confess and more wildly made use of by some people  either this is an ecclesiastical obligation or a civil one both it cannot be  if it be a civil obligation how will you understand it are you to do it by force if so the very words as far as in our power are against you vltra posse non est esse i presume no man will say he is bound to the attempt whether possible or no like the fifth monarchymadmen in england who were to crown king jesus with an army of    men and so went out to fight the lord against the mighty it is plain the impossibility on that side dissolves the nature of the oath  if it be an ecclesiastical oath it must be executed in an ecclesiastical manner and here all your weapons are put into your hands and a fair field given you and i long i confess to see the war begun but what are the weapons truly they are terrible ones the word and prayer and here you may execute your engagements to the full pray them down and preach them down and live them down and the sooner this strife begins the better i am sure the union will be far from obstructing it and i wish all the strife in britain i mean as to religion was reduced to this  in short to any that are willing to judge impartially it must be evident the church of scotland has no manner of concern in this treaty as a church her establishment is founded upon the laws which laws are made inviolable by the treaty no ways subjected to the parliamentary power that shall follow and consequently entirely free from the legislation of the episcopal clergy of england  upon this foundation being laid it must follow that the oaths or obligations insisted upon here are not at all affected by this union and therefore with submission to the presbytery of hamilton there can be no shadow of national perjury in it  as to any parts of the oaths which seems to engage the people of scotland not to alter their constitution it would be ridiculous and absurd for then   mo they must pretend they are bound never to mend their condition though the greatest advantages in the world were to be offered them   do though subversion at home or invasion abroad offered it self they could not unite with any body tho for the support and preservation of themselves to bind themselves to these things would make it an unlawful oath for every man and every government is bound to do all possible and lawful things for the good and advantage of the public and to swear not to do that good which is your duty would be unlawful  all the cavils at the form have been effectually answered already i shall repeat nothing nor enquire any more into the suggestions of the treaty being an entire surrender of the constitution dissolving subjecting etc the word union is an answer to it union cannot be a subjection the word treaty is another how can a treaty upon conditions be a surrender of freedom how can making of agreements upon articles be called a subjection  i see nothing needful to add to this argument i would be glad to hear what any mens scruples may dictate by way of further objection but till then i must conclude the oaths and national obligations of the people of scotland are not at all concerned in this union how binding soever they may be in other cases  to fill people then with scruples at the public affairs and alarm them with breaking oaths national perjury and the like where the oath is not at all concerned is nothing but the effect of party insinuations a handle formed to be taken hold of to serve a turn and to fright innocent people from joining in the good of their native country  i must confess i know not what to say to the multiplying oaths on either hand and heartily wish neither nation were so much encumbred with them as they are a general union of temper and affection which i hope will at last follow the union of politics will soon take away not the obligation but the occasion of these bonds from us all  i cannot therefore sufficiently applaud the prudence of the public in the case of a new invented oath here lately offered in the commission and afterward in parliament and rejected in both  i must confess i think there are good reasons to be given against imposing oaths of any sort upon the subject other than the common oath of obedience to the government which is a reciprocal obligation the king or queen taking an oath to govern and the subjects to obey and both with this sanction as the test of the obligation viz according to law  the frequency of oaths has in my observation these fatal but constant mischiefs attending it first that it tends to lessening the solemnity of the thing by making a formal swearing familiar to the people and i could give sad instances of this in england where the word a customhouse oath is become such a proverb and the thing such a jest that it is fitter to be called a customary oath and in some other cases i believe i could instance in some oaths of freedoms and corporations which i may say it is impossible to keep  if these things are true as i do not desire to prove because i had rather conceal them i think they should caution any nation against crouding the people with oaths and especially unnecessary ones    in all kinds of oaths relating to payment of taxes there are snares to the people and this effect follows of course that he gets most money whose conscience is loosest he that can swear hardest pays least and the man of conscience who dare not tamper with his maker nor hurry up his meaning in suppositions but when he is to swear considers of the fact and confines himself to the truth lies under the discouragement of paying the most duties and being undersold and injured in his trade  this is my observation only on oaths in general but as to religious tests and oaths by way of equivalent i must confess there is something astonishing in it to see some gentlemen warm for them that have so freely censured and perhaps too justly their neighbors for making the like  i frankly own i believe the sacramental test imposed in england a thing unlawful in its nature and irreligious as it is a debasing the sacred institutions of christ jesus to uses differing remote and perhaps contrary to their primitive institution and i make no question but even the church of england themselves when further enlightened from heaven and the time of their complete reformation shall come will free the nation from those ecclesiastical fetters which are the only remains of the tyranny and popish practices of the late abdicated times  but how it came into the thoughts of any people here who at the same time have been very free with england on that head to fall into the same evil and prepare the very same chains for their native country under which their neighbors so loudly groan and for which they so loudly have blamed them is a mystery past my understanding  the parliament have therefore very wisely rejected their proposal as the commission had done before and the gentlemen who too hastily came in to it will i doubt not in time see that they have cause to be thankful for being delivered though against their wills  i kno twill be objected here that the oath proposed was only designed for such of the english nation etc that should come to enjoy places of trust or profit in scotland  but give me leave to let such gentlemen know that ye had thereby opened the door to the thing in general and by approving the placing religious oaths on their civil employments tho now confined to strangers they for ever stopped their own mouths against all possible objection if the same in time to come should on any other occasion be expected of them  they could never have argued against the lawfulness of the thing they could never have fenced against the profaneness and irreligion of it the dishonor etc it is to the institution and nature of an oath since their mouths would be effectually stopped by telling them that when it served their own turn they could descend to the very same thing and were for hampering the consciences of others  besides who is it they would have bound to own the presbyterian church of scotland upon oath and let us examine a little the reason and kindness of it  the answer will be ready i kno it is the english  well gentlemen and who among the english would you entangle thus the honest men or the knaves it is plain the last will not be entangled by it for they will take forty oaths to get a good place there is none but the honest men that you can have a design upon and it is a little hard you should contrive methods to let the knaves in among you and shut honest men out  well but says another warm gentleman we would keep church of england men out in general   say you so sir then you should have altered your oath and have made it that the person should have sworn that he was not of the church of england or to abjure episcopacy or some oath particularly bent against prelacy in general or the church of england in particular but it is plain this oath would as effectually have foreclosed three parts in four of all the dissenters in england as well as all that were conscientious among the church so that in short only one sect of dissenters might come among you for which many of your honest brethren of the dissenters with whom you make no scruple to join in communion when you come to england are excluded for which they are very much beholding to you  i might here enter upon a debate against the making an oath of faith  i believe there is room to question whether in the nature of the thing called faith every man can swear to what he believes swear that he believes this or that church to be the only true church or this or that worship to be the only true worship  likewise i must own i think it is very hard to make any man swear as in a certain oath is expressed to continue in the profession and obedience of this or that religion or opinion all the days of our lives whereas perhaps the person may be some time or other possessed in his conscience with convictions that he ought to alter some part of that profession either as to doctrine or discipline fundamental or circumstance  but i omit entering on this debate not that i think it difficult but with the apostle i say i hope without profaneness i have many things to say but you cannot bear them now  the end of this discourse is in order to open the eyes of those wellmeaning people who seem prejudiced that the parliament has not agreed to the proposed oaths but has cautiously refused to put that knife into their hands with which they would have wounded themselves  they can have no reason to be uneasy at this since it is what no man can defend it is the burden the bondage and in my opinion the scandal of their neighbor nation and what i could say if the season were proper this treaty would in some measure have delivered them from had the gentlemen here not thought fit to raise that devil which i doubt will not be in their power to lay but of this i may have occasion to speak hereafter and at present do not think it reasonable to explain my self further  i believe both nations freest from bondage when they are freest from oaths of distinction and while they continue i shall never esteem the union as perfect in all its parts to have made new ones here therefore would have been a step to prevent or at least delay that more christian union of hearts and affections among all the subjects of britain which all wise men wish and good men pray for  finis
