joanna of montfaucon a dramatic romance of the fourteenth century as performed at the theater royal covent garden formed upon the plan of the german drama of kotzebue and adapted to the english stage by richard cumberland  london printed by luke hansard great turnstile lincolns end fields for lackington allen and co temple of the muses finsbury square   00  to the reader the german original of this play which its author styles a dramatic romance of the fourteenth century has not i believe as yet been published it never came under my inspection and if it had i could have made no use of it not understanding a syllable of the language  the model upon which i worked was an english translation that professed nothing more than fidelity to the words of the author and this i have no doubt it correctly performed in this copy i discovered the framework of what might be made a splendid spectacle and the known liberality of those in whom the property and conduct of the theater are vested has more than equalled every expectation i could ground upon their support what else i discovered except as above stated it may not become me to say for i have no right to pronounce upon an author who composes in a language unknown to me but certain it is i stand responsible to the public for every sentence in this drama now before them with the exception of a very few periods indeed and those of no great importance let kotzebue therefore answer for no more than belongs to him  the plot and fabric of joanna whether i have marred it or mended it in the execution can only be decided when the public shall be in possession of the means for comparing them  it has so rarely been my habit to write upon any plot but of my own fabrication and invention that what i assert in the prologue is most strictly true viz  all who could judge my labor would confess originality had made it less whether from inaptitude for the task or from whatever other cause my embarrassments have proceeded such they have been and so many times have i woven and unwoven this penelopes web that if plays were only to be appreciated by the pains they cost in composing this of mine would have a merit which i suspect the world will not be in the humor to attach to it then indeed i should have one fair exception to set against the many instances of precipitation of which i stand accused but of which i cannot be duly convicted till it is known of how many hours my day consists and what portion of those i devote to my studies  i have heard several authors instance a dispatch in composition of which i have no conception but with respect to the drama now submitted whether i did or did not write it stans pede in uno i can only assure the public i will never stand upon german legs any more but take my chance with my countrymen for so much of their favor as my own independent efforts can obtain for me  i have now been so often before the reader that i must claim the privilege of addressing him as a friend whom i am not to flatter and in whose company i am not to degrade myself by an unmanly style of supplication assumed for no other purpose than to invoke his candor the which if he has not false diffidence will not create and if he has plain speaking will not offend i therefore shall not scruple to say speaking under the sanction of age and long experience that the diction of joanna is not inferior to that of any of my most favored plays i know i have outlived the time when a simple and consistent fable developed in correct and classic diction presenting characters to be found in nature and producing incidents not irreconcilable to probability can no longer attract i also perceive i have lived to see the time when not content with the eccentricities of our own stage we have gone to that of the germans for fresh supplies of what we were overstocked with  false writing and false moral it is too often that the success or failure of a play depends upon the cast not upon the composition of course the play is written more for the actors behind the curtain than for the audience before it this makes tragedy run riot and comedy play the antic we have actors who possess such irresistible power over the risibility of the spectator that our writers for the stage find their account in availing themselves of those powers and produce a species of composition which departing from the character of the legitimate drama may be said to border very nearly upon farce and mummery  where fashion points the stage will follow if endeavoring to write according to nature and good models the dramatic author finds himself deserted by the town who but will be weary of the attempt if the public taste is vitiated the remedy is not with him the critic may take up the cause a good dramatic censor may do much but a scurrilous one can effect nothing are authors only to be lashed and their misleaders to be passed over uncorrected the enlarged expenses of our royal theaters do not warrant their proprietors in opposing themselves to the public taste  how then should authors undertake it  as i have been uniformly adverse in my opinion to the introduction of these german dramas on the english stage it may well be supposed my reasons for undertaking to adapt this of joanna were strong ones and in yielding to them i have only to regret that my endeavors have not been more serviceable to the interests of a theater to which i have every obligation not only for the fair and honorable treatment i experienced from the proprietors but also for the warm and cordial support i received from the performers mr incledon in particular has a claim to my best acknowledgments for his very honorable and zealous perseverance in his duty under circumstances of such an afflicting nature as might have fully justified him for declining it  in the copy now printed i have not altogether adhered to the prompters book as it was altered after the first nights representation the reader will observe i have retained the incident of lazarras falling by the hand of joanna this i have done because i see no particular reason for departing so entirely from the authors first conception though good reason obtained in point of action for the alteration that was made on the second night on the german stage albert in the combat with his rival stumbles over the root of a tree and falls to the ground in this instant joanna rushes in accoutred in the complete armor of a warlike knight and with a huge sword of twohanded sway dispatches lazarra at a stroke albert thus critically rescued rises and requests the unknown knight to put up his visor when to his astonishment he discovers his preserver in the person of his wife how they may manage these matters on the german stage i cannot pretend to say perhaps their actors may be better duellists and their actresses more adroit in warlike operations than ours but if we found difficulty in the action simplified as it is how much more should we have been embarrassed in point of execution had we undertaken to perform it in the spirit of the original  in the concluding scene of the third act wensel in the original gets drunk upon the stage and the keys are taken out of his chamber by philip whilst his intoxicated father lies buried in profound sleep if what i substituted in place of this incident is not so near to nature as the original it is certainly less offensive to decorum and better suited to the manners of our english stage when i am speaking of this scene unquestionably the most prominent in the play i cannot pass it over without acknowledging my obligations to the young and rising actor whose energetic and impressive execution in the character of philip gave such brilliancy to the representation and displayed powers which when drawn forth by abler authors and better opportunities cannot fail to place him in the very highest rank of his profession  the joanna of kotzebue is kept out of sight during the whole time that lazarra is in possession of her castle and of course is never before the audience but in the opening and conclusion of the play it appeared to me expedient to fill up this hiatus and of course her scenes in the middle acts are supplementary  in like manner wolf in the original is merely the shadow of a character the support of such an actor as mr munden is an object which every author will reach at with avidity i sincerely thank him for his cordial assistance i wish my efforts had been more proportionate to his merit to the performers who condescended to appear in characters neither adequate to their merits nor consonant with their feelings i have more to offer than acknowledgments i must beg them to accept my apology  as there is no music in the original i must in justice exonerate the author from all responsibility on the score of the discarded page when his singing ceased his services were no longer wanted two songs were composed for this character though but one was performed these exquisite melodies will i hope be published by the composer and that i may not appear to keep that out of sight which will do him so much honor to produce i retain those songs in my copy and of course the whole part of eugene  the overture chorusses and songs incidental to the piece with four symphonies between the acts were all composed for the occasion by mr thomas busby he also in the run of the piece substituted a new quintetto instead of the peasants chorus in the opening scene and at the same time withdrew the finale of joy joy joy and introduced upon the ninth night a shorter and most brilliant chorus to the following words hail glorious day death strikes our impious foe and victory binds her wreath on virtues brow   it is matter of the highest satisfaction to me to find that the public have done justice to his eminent abilities i sincerely hope this his first essay in the dramatic line will encourage him to employ his talents upon a larger and more splendid scale where genius so sublime is combined with science so profound what is there within the province of his studies which the world may not expect from mr busby  as the opposition which was given to this play upon the first evening only of its performance has passed over me without injury i should have passed over it without a remark but that i am given to understand an opinion was in circulation that i had vanity enough to conceive i had prepared a spectacle and composed a drama to rival nay to eclipse one that was triumphantly established on the sister stage as an author i have never appealed from the decisions of the theater conscious that nothing can be more perfectly at the mercy of the public than an authors reputation when he has committed it to the stage i have never offered a single word in arrest of judgment however rigorous nor persisted to obtrude myself when i had once discovered i was no longer welcome that we had no reason to yield the play up upon the partial clamor of the first night the event of the second clearly evinced not a murmur was heard and the applause was general if i had been the arrogant man which it is presumed i was thought to be by some of my opponents their resentment would have fallen so much more heavily upon the liberal proprietors of the theater than upon me individually that there would have been infinitely more cruelty than justice in their revenge but the task of adapting this german drama to our stage was no work of my seeking and though i expended more pains upon it than i ever did upon any play in my life the hopes i formed of its success were chiefly grounded on the brilliancy of the spectacle and the excellence of the music as for pizarro i envy not his success i do not aspire to rival it i cannot wish to lessen it and if any man doubts my sincerity let him put himself in the predicament of an author for years held off from receiving the fair and moderate earnings of his productive services and looking to that very fund for indemnification then let him ask his conscience what he would say to such an idle imputation and his answer shall be mine  r c  prologue the scenes that soon will open to your view in their first sketch a foreign author drew if merely tracing his inventive thought we set translations servile task at naught all who can judge our labor must confess originality had made it less our dramatists you know in every age have copied from the french and spanish stage we have done less  for save in plot alone the work from top to bottom is our own  these four lines between brackets were not spoken still if you think the british stage disgraced is it by us or by the public taste let our spectators stoop to your decree and as our masters are such we will be if thus toward you in conscience we are clear there is nothing from our foreign friend to fear we have given him all our care  with musics aid and paintings art his splendid scene arrayed that when his muse imperial shall be shown audience not less illustrious than her own she may not have it in her power to say a british stage disgraced a german play the author of our plot from married life selects his heroine a virtuous wife this character as fearing to advance fiction too bold he paints as a romance we under no such terrors vouch it true and for its living model point to you asserting you in grace and goodness show all that was lovely centuries ago conscious though wives of old were more demure your eyes may sparkle and your hearts be pure here we conclude for music now prepares her better prologue to more moving airs  if knotted oaks will bend to her appeal need she despair that hearts of oak will feel dramatis personae albert lord of thurn mr pope lazarra a knight

wave all comments on his hangdog face i only say he wears lazarras livery and therefore catching him in the coat of a scoundrel i humbly apprehend he cannot fail to be of the complexion of a rascal   albert that is but an outside argument friend wolf   wolf sir take which side you will of a convicted thief and you shall find him still an arrant knave for here is the case  this fellow lurks about and hides in the thick woods why does he so why but because the gallows stands in sight and it is a pretty eyetrap he has no taste for being a twolegd building without floors the which who takes possession of is left to dangle and cut capers in the air  i pray you sir give him a lease for life of that same airy tenement that skyparlour   albert how long has it been my custom to condemn a man

your master i am a stranger to   wolf indeed where have you lived his charities are pretty well known   hermit i have heard of them they are gone to heaven before him   wolf truly i fear he will shortly follow them for when we parted he was on his way and had but barely got the start of death as for my part i was thrown out of the race being down in battle with half a score of rapiers at my throat expecting every moment my quietus but this good father is a soldiers story and only should be told over a can   hermit come on then you shall have the can my friend and i the story for i love a soldier i dwell no further off than in that rock and have employed no architect but nature  so we poor hermits are content to live   wolf i know what sort of tenements yours are and how you live scotfree under the wind and pay no rent except to providence on whose account you garnish out your lodgings with mementoes that mark the tenure under which you hold but all your skulls and bones will

master has too much of the virtue of benevolence in himself not to acknowledge it in other people   hermit i have simply done my duty that is no praise   wolf in a degenerate world it is some praise there are who have abundance and yet want you live in poverty and have to spare now father fare thee well i will to the hills and see what metal hearts are made of there if this lazarra and his foreign cutthroats are to insult our nation seize our castles and live at large upon us farewell freedom i will rather fly my country and turn jew than be a swiss and own myself a slave   exit hermit oh loved helvetia oh my native country how long ye sons of freedom will ye suffer these foreign hypocrites to dwell amongst you when they affect to embrace you as their brethren they meditate to throw their chains about you and make you bondsmen under the pretense of moderation they would fain conceal monstrous ambition just insatiable of universal power and pride so vast that having vowed eternal enmity to earthly kings they impiously assail the throne of heaven and rather than confess a greater than themselves deny their god   eloisa enters carrying a basket eloisa father   hermit my child   eloisa are you not angry with me for tarrying so long i ran to you at last and brought you something are you not hungry poor old man   hermit not so thy charity forestalls my wants   eloisa i should

 eloisa he gave to those that hungerd he himself hungers in chains alas i pity him   hermit yes human sufferings strike our hearts with pity and often we wonder at the ways of providence that thus permits good men to be oppressed but whilst we only reason from effects heaven acts from causes unreveald to us   eloisa ah father these are things above my reach i have not understanding of these matters but believe it all because you say it you may have known variety of fortune i have no experience of that sort my life has been a scene of uniform depression i have often asked the history of your days but you have no confidence in me to tell it   hermit t will give you pain why should you wish to hear it   eloisa the tender pain that pity gives is pleasing   hermit i have seen better days been rich and noble and all the soft affinities so dear to human nature i have fondly cherished heavens mercy gave them cruel man destroyed them   eloisa ah poor unfortunate you have been a father    hermit i have and when you call me by that name the recollection that i had a daughter who might have been the blessing of my age this this my child pulls at my heart strings  and when i would speak at thy desire i cannot  i am stifled   eloisa then i will never ask it more  and now behold my father and that odious darbony  retire into that grotto good old man and take your basket with you harbor

better world the renovation of our faithful love made pure and perfect will compose a part of that beatitude which heart of man cannot conceive and only heaven can give  my last farewell and blessing

master all is yours  all that is mine and all that has been alberts   joanna away i would prefer the vilest dungeon whose pestilential vapor fraught with death should be so fatal that you dare not

saved from death if you betray me not   eloisa if we betray you we are not those that would betray the wretch that fled from justice to invoke protection how then should we betray the good lord albert

eloisa oh approving heaven crown him reward him for the glorious deed my philip has preserved you i acquit him i was in like extremity with you at the same hour i called him to my rescue in vain his virtue triumphed over his love he turned from me and saved his benefactor i praise him i applaud him for the choice you had a husbands and a fathers claim for you the hearts of thousands would have bled for me none other than his own   hermit and mine   eloisa ah father if you knew the lord of thurn   hermit i hope he has been taught to know himself in his adversity  i knew his father   albert i am sorry for it if you knew him rightly for then you know what cause i have to blush when i am falsely styled the lord of thurn   hermit that to confess bespeaks a candid mind for that i honor you but thurn is lost what then remains   albert before tomorrows dawn either to see lazarra at my feet or see the light no more if on the walls my banner flies it flies not for myself but for the daughter of that rightful lord who in his banishment was basely murdered   hermit alas that daughter never will be found nor was that father murdered he yet lives and i am he yes albert i i am that wretched father degraded exiled and at once bereft of wife son daughter outcast of the world no home no country not one friend on earth save this sweet innocent the feeble staff of an old beggar tottering to his grave   albert oh heavenly justice how did i escape whilst you was begging at that castles gate which i unconscious of your right usurped   hermit that i am theodore the banished lord of thurn and its domain i had in proof to show one relick which the robbers missed my crest a crowned lion cut in ruby but this last pledge i left in guntrams hands for purposes which this dear child can witness   albert there needs no witness to the truth you utter and here in presence of high heaven i swear to pay you homage and restore your right   hermit no no your virtues have atoned to justice you albert

not new to you   eloisa my lord i have often asked but never heard it he always put me by when i made suit to share his sorrows  but behold he comes   hermit returns with a bloody mantle hermit this this is all that is left me of my daughter this garment purpled as you see with blood  here streamed that lifeblood than my own more dear and though my tears have almost blanched the spots they cannot wash away the deep remembrance of my afflicting loss   eloisa oh agonizing sight   albert unhappy father what can i do for thee   hermit nothing for me childless and old forgetting this vain world and by the world forgotten for myself i only ask a grave  but for this innocent whom i have snatched from misery and who clings as if by natures charter to my heart  for her i make appeal to your protection and as in honor you shall deal with her so may heaven deal forgiveness to your father   albert she is my care henceforth and would to heaven when thus i take her hand in pledge of faith twas in my power to say  behold your daughter    darbony and armed men rush in darbony that is the damsel seize and take her hence   eloisa heaven show thy mercy   hermit villains loose your hold

will do as well   albert forbear thou art too bloody   wolf you see i am he has drawn my blood why should not i open a vein for him   albert stand off and quit him what is your pretense for seizing this young woman   darbony if i had seized her and secured my prize i should have had a title lord of thurn superior to your own   albert what do you mean is she not guntrams daughter   darbony i am your prisoner you have saved my life therefore i tell you fairly not one drop of guntrams blood runs in those noble veins i would not treat with him till he confessed it i marry guntrams daughter  no he stole her like a thief she is the daughter of theodore the ancient lord of thurn and had i married her    albert break off the father the father stands before you   hermit oh my daughter   eloisa philip support me bear me to his feet that i may kneel  oh tell me tell me truly if it was natures instinct that inspired me to love thee honor thee and call thee father   hermit oh heaven how wonderful art thou in mercy i am lost the blessing is too vast for me my weak frame totters lead me to my cell   exit supported by eloisa and philip albert how is this old friend a tear on that rough cheek   wolf yes a rough tear not one of your soft drops that whimpering pity sheds i never weep except for joy that honest men are happy come signor darbony enter the cell you are not overburdend with humanity a few more lessons of this sort will not hurt you   enter the cell end of the fourth act act v scene a defile in the neighborhood of thurn castle albert philip hermit eloisa wolf and soldiers albert now comrades mark where the declining moon propitious to our enterprise withdraws her fading crescent the dark hour comes on and warns us to the charge   philip we are all ready our mountaineers are ambushd within call where shall we storm   albert upon the western flank the moat is fordable and the wall weakest there he has secured the bridge   wolf i wish we had done as much before he passed it but rogues are wiser in their generation than we dull downright fellows are in ours   albert ah philip my whole heart is sick with dread of what has passed within the castle   philip we shall soon have the castle   albert shall we have the lives within it shall i greet my wife shall i embrace my son   philip dismiss these terrors and repose your hope where you have lodged your faith draw forth your sword we cannot fail to conquer when those we combat are the foes of heaven   albert it is done now heroes follow to the charge   philip a moments patience where shall we bestow this aged father and his defenseless daughter   albert wolf you are wounded you shall stay behind there lives not one more worthy of that trust   wolf there lives not one less likely to perform it for though i have a reverence for old age and a soft side toward innocence and beauty yet if i hear the clash of swords in battle i must perforce turn out and make one with them therefore let me be foremost in the onset and last in the retreat  there is my post   hermit i will not hold one hero from his duty and though i can no longer wield a sword behold i have a weapon  shows a dagger this and the darkness of the night will guard us therefore go forth and conquer   eloisa there is an arbor philip knows the spot of natures making in the chestnut grove beside the western tower there we may pass the anxious minutes and put up our prayers for your success   albert escort them to the place we the mean while will martial our brave band and for our wives our children and our altars assured of conquest we rush upon the foe   exeunt scene changes to an apartment in the castle of thurn joanna enters the monster will not let me see my child  well heavens high will be done  there was a time when my afflicted spirit was prepared to die with albert but last night in silence i commund with my heart and heard a voice that seemed to cry within me  hold thine hand creature of god thy life is not thine own and none but he that gave can take away  i started left my couch my lamp was burning the book of life was open on my table i read the text was  patience  and the word of inspiration sunk into my heart with influence so persuasive so serene that as i read i reasoned and perceived when heaven is pleased to punish it is our part to suffer and submit  eugene approach  eugene enters to joanna is there not something stirring in the castle that occupies my tyrant and reprieves me from his detested presence  eugene i think there is  scouts are for ever passing that scour the country round the walls are manned in all the watch towers sentinels are posted and by what is going forward i should suppose he looks to be attacked   joanna alas what can my helpless people do when their brave leaders lost and wolf is killed and philip is far off   eugene of philip i know nothing but for wolf i must believe he lives and that i saw him   joanna boy youre deceived let me not hear of hope save what the cheering recollection gives that all the sufferings of this transient life must have a speedy end of this assured i am prepared for conscience sake to brave all that lazarras fury can inflict to shake my honor or subdue my spirit for it is no question with me whom to fear  him a contemptible and shortlived tyrant that only can afflict me for awhile or that tremendous judge whose just award is happiness or misery without end   exit eugene she is gone and knows not yet the full extent of her affliction  when she shall be told lord albert fell not in the field of battle but butchered by assassins in the dungeon of his own belmont what will then support her will sighs and tears relieve her sad despair oh they would i would weep my eyes to water  to sigh when sorrow loads the breast is natures kind relief to weep is almost to be blessed amid the burst of grief sigh then sad dame if sighs may cheer a heart oppressed as thine weep and i will double every tear for all thy griefs are mine  exit scene changes to the saxon hall lazarra with armed followers lazarra albert ere this is dead where is joanna the spark of pity that was quick within me her insolent defiance has extinguished my temper and my time are both exhausted let her be summoned and at once determine for life or death my victim or my bride  do you hear me sluggards which of you has charge

  lazarra if the moat s fordable where is our defense the wall being left in breach it is well for us that albert is not living  now what news   a soldier enters soldier my lord it is said that

forced your castle  true for in your castle there dwelt a lady whom you dared to marry in violation of the laws of honor   albert honor you ought not to pronounce the name   lazarra what was your honor when you fled your castle and left joanna in your rivals power   albert joannas purity defies your power   lazarra i suffer none to live that dare defy it one triumph i have had one yet remains
