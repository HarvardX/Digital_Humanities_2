shed their childrens blood smollett printed for pratt and clinch bath and r baldwin london  m dcc lxxx  to dr delacour sir i am not going to ascribe to you a miracle i renounce enthusiasm and think too highly of your understanding to insult it by flattery but so far as second causes may be necessary to fulfill the fiat of the first in the government of human affairs i do in the most solemn manner believe you were the means of saving me in the last summer from death  prior to the event which procured me the benefit of your advice it had been my chief pleasure to compose the volumes which now approach you struck by an uncommon tenderness in the circumstances whereon the work is founded i wished earnestly for health to finish what might prove a source of virtuous entertainment not that i laid any stress on my own effort toward it but because the facts were preeminently beautiful in themselves and courted every addition of fancy with every embellishment of the heart i recovered emma corbett was concluded the incidents without the least literary adornment take a strong hold of the feelings and probably will owe more to their simplicity and native truth than if by a more elaborate effort i had robbed them of this genuine advantage  the tear of sensibility is at once the softest and best evidence of the praise which it is my ambition to merit on this occasion and if it be my lot to enjoy this honor you cannot be ignorant of the means by which it has been conferred notwithstanding this every thing which tends to show the world how entirely your generosity prevailed over your interest will i know be interdicted i comply therefore sir with the proscriptions of delicacy though i am thereby deprived of doing justice and with whatever difficulty i repress the current of my gratitude only reserving to myself the pleasure to declare publicly how much i am sir  your most obliged and most obedient servant the author bath april      0 emma corbett letter i to henry hammond esquire hammond you have hurt me i can no longer look on you with pleasure forbear your visits my daughter emma shall not be yours i have an objection will you hear it explained being explained will you remove it you can you ought you must or this closes our connection to be at a word will you render it possible for me to call you my son i write in confidence reply without delay i love exactness farewell  charles corbett  letter ii mr hammonds answer there is then a possibility o my dear mr corbett of surmounting this objection do you ask as a petition what you might claim as a command generous friend o name the circumstance hint your expectations and give me  all that i can desire  an opportunity to obey them have you not been the guardian of my youth are you not the father of emma i am all impatience and i am  ever yours henry hammond  letter iii to mr hammond your promises are fair and the language in which they are expressed is proper to your age and suitable to your character i hasten to give you the opportunity you invite  resign your commission  that commission which against all dissuasive hints you have solicited and procured transfer your sword or else draw it in the cause of liberty and heaven your schoolfellow edward has as you know fallen a victim to these hostilities my darling son is no more he was plentifully provided for in the colonies  the spot which he occupied was disforested forested by his ancestors who at the cost of infinite toil turned to a smiling domain what they found a wilderness inauspicious to every purpose of society it descended to this unhappy youth just as tyranny began to forge chains for freedom and he traversed the sea to defend his property he would not suffer the legacy of his uncle to be ravished from him by the spoiler while a hand remained to prevent the plunder he took possession of the land which before was under the superintendance of an agent you know how soon he was invaded  how soon his little territory was laid waste  his house set fire to  and how when the enemy advanced to his door he was hurried into arms he became a soldier on necessity he fought  he fell   the blow which killed a son had well nigh killed a father also  yet in presence of emma and you i exerted my utmost fortitude but the wound is not healed it is still bleeding at my heart to mens eyes it seems well i have tied about it a political bandage yet i secretly detest every principle which begun and every motive which continues this assassination of america long i have kept the anguish of these sentiments to myself it makes no part of my conversation  but now finding your ardour o my dear harry likely to take a wrong direction it is time to speak  it is time to tell you what will lose and what gain me for ever hammond you are about to engage in a cruel cause  a cause to which i object both as patriot and as parent the vigor with which you have sought to obtain an authority to go forth amongst your countrymen against your countrymen bears in it something shocking to my nature whom i thought tender i find bloody do you desire to be a hero the means are ready change the position of the attack and that will in itself be heroism or which is still better if you could cultivate the embellishing arts of peace and the muses who love you apologize to your patron the earl for the trouble you have given  take the hand of emma corbett and with her share the fortunes of her father  these sentiments declare my opinion of your honor and my esteem for your person is expressed in the presents i tender perceiving how obstinately you were bent to aid this fallacious plot against the rights of nature and mankind i thought to let you go blindly on to blacken yet more the catalogue of british oppressors but i well knew the source and progress of that sentiment which unites you to my only surviving child and i feel myself unwilling that the son of a dear deceased friend should thus prostitute his courage in an action so peculiarly base so peculiarly barbarous emma fortune and my favor are before you you know the prizes and you are not now ignorant of the only mode of conduct by which they can be obtained farewell then think seriously venerate my trust and do not forfeit my esteem i put you to the test  charles corbett  letter v to c corbett esquire no greater time is necessary to determine than that which will be taken up in penning the determination i do venerate your trust my principles make sacred every mans private opinion but the very same principles compel me to forfeit even your affection sir if it is to be preserved at the price of my duty we unfortunately happen to see the american dispute in opposite lights it is sufficient to a soldier that he believes his quarrel to be just you arraign my humanity wherefore i retort not the accusation may we not consider a public contest in different points of view and yet be friends both may act from feeling and both on principle you imagine america is aggrieved while i look upon her as the aggressor what of that do we interfere with the opinions of each other i was not accessory to the death of your son and had it been my fate to meet him in the field i can conceive the point on which nature would have insisted she would gracefully have led us both a little from the line of duty and spared one in sympathy to the other nay more had i seen the sword tremble at his bosom my own should for that moment have been as a shield and you know not how far i would have ventured for the brother of emma but as to the commission o be assured i did not solicit till i had well reflected on every consequence probable and possible of obtaining it it is obtained and i rejoice nor could it be resigned to purchase a diadem with emma on a throne to wear it change sides no sir if these are to be the terms take back the hand you permitted me to win and possess undivided her fortune and your own you have not looked accurately at my soul as i am not on the one hand so sensual to gratify my passion at the expense of the holy faith and the solemn services which i have sworn to my country so neither am i so sordid on the other as to court her inheritance without many endeavors consistent with the powers of my youth to add something to her fortune patrimony has dropped from my hope but nature may perhaps have bestowed the equivalent the arts of war rather than those of peace seem at this conjuncture to lay the strongest claim to the genius of a young englishman and i have no notion of that indolence which can be content to fall into the arms of beauty and prosperity without a single effort to deserve them if sir i have any tender interest in the heart of emma  as i think i have it has been more generously sought but why do i argue with so much gravity when perhaps you intend all this in the way of trial willing to see if my attachment to my native country was not less than my passion for my mistress yes yes this is your experiment you wanted to know whether it was appetite or affection that influenced me in regard to your daughter and you will not i trust be displeased to find the basis as solid as your friendship or solicitude might desire adieu dear sir i thank you for the stratagem and glory in every success that draws me nearer to your heart adieu  henry hammond  letter vi to mr hammond poor misguided youth receive the last kindness i can ever show you receive my pity you will however in common politeness cease to render yourself unwelcome and save me from an appearance of inhospitality i think you ought as a man of honor to drop corresponding with emma and let it seem to be your own act and deed selfsuggested and selfinspired this however your conscience will best settle to that i refer you as you so soon depart a few more letters cannot be very material farther avowals of love however i shall consider as seductions farewell to wish you success in your undertakings would be to partake of your folly you will therefore excuse me i will only say what is perfectly true that i am extremely sorry for you heaven place your feet in a fairer path in that you are going to tread mr hammond you may find havoc and horror but never can find either honor or happiness  charles corbett  letter vii to c corbett esquire apprehend nothing from my intrusion sir i never enter any house whose doors do not move willingly to receive me what you are pleased to call seduction appears to me so absolute a propriety that i must take the liberty to persist in it i have reason to think the affections of your daughter are engaged i cultivated them under your approving smile and with your immediate sanction i have not a heart that can put on or cast off its partialities exactly as the opinions of a third person  even though he be a father  happen to fluctuate it is emma therefore and only emma can prevail with me to stop the current of affection or of correspondence i refer you to her conscience since it is not an apt reference you make to mine i suggest no disobedience but shall never violate one tittle of that faith which as a voluntary bond of soul is firmly given by emma corbett to  henry hammond  letter viii to henry hammond esquire inexorable boy i shall urge you no more here let all connection close for ever when i permitted you under the fair disguise of simplicity which you assumed to seek the affections of my child i had no conception there beat in your bosom so sanguinary a heart yet practice on her as you please she will return i trust to her duty and have done with her deceiver  charles corbett  letter ix to c corbett esquire have a care sir you are going over perilous ground do not as a partizan extinguish what i feel for you as the parent of emma i obey so much of your injunction as is possible and desire this may be the last of our letters yet i cannot finish without a few more sentiments the chances of war mr corbett offer no security from the plunder of the enemy my safe return to these shores is uncertain i may become a prisoner or i may fall that part of your correspondence therefore which relates to a political subject will be best in your own possession you will find it enclosed no accident can tear the deposit from my breast but i dare not trust a less faithful asylum that heaven may bless you and make us once more friends is the fervent prayer of your  h hammond  letter x to henry hammond esquire your generous spirit charms while it distresses me o hammond why have you thrown this new motive for relapsing tenderness in my way why did you not rather add fuel to flame and strengthen my displeasure cruel henry why will you not accept my friendship upon conditions so humane it is not even yet too late you still have it in your power to unite real happiness with true honor labor i conjure you to bless me and yourself i pant to embrace you to give you the paternal benediction and to give you with it my only child  charles corbett  letter xi to c corbett esquire it is not possible to be done in the way you propose though there is none other that i would not eagerly attempt yet to leave my emmas father alienated is to go with a dagger in my bosom o it will be sufficiently painful without the aid of such aggravation let me implore you sir to point out some other means of reconcilement think o think  henry hammond  letter xii to henry hammond esquire it will not admit a thought nor are there any other means within reach there is there can there shall be none  c corbett  letter xiii to c corbett esquire then let me beg of you to drop the subject and to believe in this farewell sentence that there is not a blessing in human life which is not sincerely wished you by  h hammond  letter xiv to henry hammond esquire your ship will not be ready then to bear you into the paths of danger for some days how uniformly amiable is your solicitude  dearest and best of friends  and how kind your attention to every circumstance that has the least tendency to affect my ease and my welfare i reflect upon your generous kindness with a kind of weeping rapture that wants a name but thank heaven i find my nature sufficiently susceptible and my heart sufficiently enlarged to answer the demands which your tenderness and constancy are daily drawing for and though it be a proud boast i will venture to say that in sentiment and friendship in good will and good wishes i can never die your debtor yet this little delay my dear henry  into what an exultation of spirit did it not throw us last night my beloved friend  oh last night the hours betwixt six and ten  have you any idea of a period that could be rated in comparison with them what a space it was all spirit and all soul every inferior sense was annihilated and the registering angel if such there be can hardly have marked a passage more soft more affectionate more beautiful or more pure during the whole course of that precious interview alike elegant and ardent were the expressions of our lips the flutterings of our bosoms and the feelings of our hearts  not a look not a word not a whisper not a moment but memory shall hoard with dearest care and dwell upon with increasing satisfaction virtue shall be summoned to open her immortal page and transcribe the correct pleasures of last night amongst the whitest transactions of humanity o twas a lovely melancholy period that the heart will dwell upon with tenderest affection while it remains accessible to any soft impression after you left me my friend i continued still in converse with you or personally in vision pure or by the assistance of this little instrument as fancy took the lead the bright scenes that were then painted  with all their vivid images around me  how how shall i describe them ah henry the closer i look into your heart  the deeper and the more deliberately i examine and analize its properties the more i admire and applaud oh my friend my most congenial and most amiable friend could i speak or write of the spotless hours which we have passed together with half the heartfelt satisfaction that i think of them  my language would be indeed eloquent  it would emulate your own ye prudes in virtue say say ye severest do i confess too much ah that i knew words sufficiently ardent to say more i am unequal to the task it is pride and gratitude sensibility and softness such are my fixed and solemn sentiments not spoken at hazard but grounded on the most perfect experience the propriety of my choice has been confirmed proofs have assisted proofs and still the last is the strongest  doubt not but i have read the sentiments which meant to reconcile me to your departure again and again as tenderly as attentively i have indeed perused and reperused them till the characters are almost washed away i only mean from the paper the impressions remain uninjured elsewhere o hammond hammond how the soft emotions agitate the heart at the command of your affecting pen as i read your pages of this morning distress and joy complaint and resignation the tear of anguish and the smile of hope all struggled together in every pulse i felt the force of your tender eloquence it had power to smooth the rugged front of war and i represented you returning victorious from the battle every varying sensation took its turn to reign at one moment i was soothed at another chilled what feeling of the soul did not alternately assert its dominion i was disturbed quieted agonized and made supremely happy yet o my friend it requires an inspiration even brighter than your own to disguise the tempest which is gathering around me and to render me insensible i am not prone to make any event in life a source of unnecessary misery on the contrary i have a strong constitutional propensity to content and a kind of resisting quality in my nature which disposes me to ward off all imaginary evil but the departure of henry is not an imaginary evil it is a blow which however suspended cannot fail most deeply to affect whenever it falls and fall it must within the compass of  what a few days  ah my god spare spare memdashthe tribute of my tenderness is streaming on my paper my hand trembles in obedience to the terrors of my heart and i drop the pen  emma in continuation i must add to this letter a few after observations which a reperusal of it has given birth to in the closing passages perhaps it may appear that i have said too much i am never quite satisfied with my expressions afraid from motives of the most delicate consideration left i should say too little or too much i often repress what rises to my lip and look cautiously with the minds eye at every fond emotion before i dare venture to give it the stamp of language but you are going from me ah go not with one sentiment against your emma if in compliance with the decent usage of the world or the prejudice of a worthy father or my particular sense of that precise decorum which it becomes every unmarried woman to adopt if henry i have hence at any time been witheld from more cordial declarations  declarations which you might well expect in return for yours so ardent and so elegant  allow for me allow for my sex allow for my situation consider that i am a woman and a daughter as well as the choice of henry that honor which is so dear to us both has a claim to various duties my nature keeps such a jealous eye upon my conduct that an instinctive something like the internal disapprobation of a wrong measure has often silenced the tenderest terms lest i should pass that sacred barrier which constitutes the chief delicacy in the character of a single woman perhaps i have carried this scruple to an extreme but i could no more help it than i can prevent the tear from starting to my eye so often as i turn my thoughts toward a separation you have sometimes looked as if you blamed me but my error is at worst a little exuberance springing from a fair stem and produced in a good soil nor will my dear henry think ill of me for indulging i acquit me then oh acquit me of all contemptible finesse and do not believe that i can be one moment insensible unmindful or ungrateful  your last letters my friend shall be preserved as relics of virtue victorious over every selfish principle and whenever i sicken at the folly and depravity of mankind i will turn to those precious pages there feast upon the hidden treasures of a tender heart forget the silly pageants that form society and for thy dear sake be reconciled to the species again adieu    letter xiv to emma corbett the delightful letter of my charming emma is lying in my bosom as i take up the pen to reply it came to hand at my poor louisas  at the house of my languishing and lovely sister she told me she expected you i passed an hour of pleasing attendance after which it became painful  ah how painful  you did not come why was this yet it matters not it was not possibie or it was not fit the fit and the possible you know are the principles which govern our affection i wanted heroism nevertheless to support the suspense with decent composure louisa said to me with a tear assisting the eloquence of her expression   what brother has not the long tenor of a sisters wretchedness and disappointment  disappointment which is to last for ever taught you to bear the loss of a single interview i felt the force of the appeal but continued to be uneasy my sister withdrew and my anxiety increased by way of mitigation i took up a pen which lay before me and marked with it my emotions i marked them my emma in numbers for the numbers came let them be acceptable let the sincerity in the sentiment atone for any defect in the poetry send me word that you are composed and let me meet you as cheerful as you ought to be in the morning louisa will look for you by ten oclock poor louisa ah that edward had not fallen  ah that the brother of emma was yet alive  that he saw the injuries done to this unhappy country with my eyes and that as much inspired by louisa as i by emma he was now making loyal preparation to fight the battle of britain by the side of  henry hammond  verses written by mr hammond in the moments of waiting an interview with emma  tender tremors touch the bosom as the gentle hour moves by expectation almost weeping tiptoe stands in either eye ii ah what precious perturbations haunt the fancy of a friend half an hour of watchful waiting seems a period without end iii when the clouds hang dark and heavy disappointment over me lowrs but as fairer fleeces favor hope bestows her promised flowers iv soon again soft fears assail me since the visit is delayed then  ah then  it is apprehension of a thousand things afraid v happily sickness may detain her  thus imagination cries happily pain or happily peril  then this bosom bleeding lies vi every step that strikes the pavement every summons at the door every sound of passing coaches warm and chill these pulses more vii now i dread the excusing message now i dread some dire disease too much wind or too much sunshine robs alike this breast of ease viii heaven must make a morn on purpose to compose the gentle heart zephyrs bland must fan the season airs their softest balms impart ix not a breath too much or little not too hot or cold a ray must impede the expectation when it is emmas meeting day x yet perchance these lovely fluttrings beauteous fears and kind distress do but serve the more to heighten tender henrys happiness xi when the fair indeed approaches every rosy terrors over after little scattered cloudings sunbeams only bless us more  stanzas added when mr hammond was about to depart  xii thus the flower which blows at morning opens more and more till noon then as chilling eve comes onward every color seems to swoon xiii but perhaps tomorrows radiance may rise lovelier from the rain and the bloom which erst did languish shall revive to bloom again letter xv to henry hammond esquire whatever is elegant beautiful or amiable in that fair blossom the human understanding under the highest culture is expressed in the correspondence of my dear henry especially in the precious favor that was enclosed in his last billet dated from the apartment of louisa ah that emma were an allaccomplished judge whose plaudits might reflect all the honor which my hero deserves to receive this being impossible let it suffice that you have in these tender effusions furnished your emma with new proofs of tenderness though none were necessary to complete the measure of either sentiment in my bosom yet such charming repetitions and innovations can never be unwelcome nor will hammond refuse or overlook this unassuming tribute  this humble and acknowledging page which simple nature and affection offers it is not the full foliage of the laurel but it is the little unobtrusive leaf of gratitude and love  yet must i not and ought i not to tremble while i praise o this america my henry these chances of war a theater of mischief already fatal to the lover of louisa  i faint under the thought the time steals on even while i am talking of its lapse your virtues all known  all tried  all pressing on the eye and twining round the heart it is terrible  it is too much in mercy be less kind  less amiable  less engaging oh if you draw the chain thus close  thus near if you bind the lovely fetter thus hard  till every comfort and every joy depends on the near and exquisite contact if you contrive thus to annihilate every object but yourself  to create a void in nature  or fill it in my idea only by your existence  and that existence is to be exposed to hourly peril  what is to become of me or when cruel necessity shall tear you from me which she is preparing to do how am i to support it eancy sickens to reflect upon the vast and formidable distance that is so soon to divide us to separate for such a purpose too how few hopes  how few consolations correspondence will be delayed  interrupted  interdicted the soft and sweet solace flowing from pen to pen will henceforth lie at the mercy of winds and waves our sentiments will depend upon the terrifying circumstances of war we shall no longer breathe the same air repose in the same island  walk under the same hemisphere but separation  uncertainty and wretchedness must ensue  o dire and deadly spirit of contention  patron of carnage and encourager of bloodshed o thou who ragest most unnaturally in the human bosom where all the graces and the affections should inhabit and set man against man  thou who have swept a brother untimely to the grave and a father a sister and a love to mourn his fate  thou whose spear seems now trembling over my panting heart which bleeds at the dangers of the youth whom i adore  oh mischievous war armed at all points against the happiness and humanity of the species  how various and how dreadful are thy horrors  i cannot bear it henry  yet let me think a little  are you not resolved  what then am i doing laboring to unman you ah forgive my inconsistency  i cannot help it  indeed i cannot no words no pen not even your own my best friend alleloquent all promethean as it is can paint the essusions of nature as they burst from me at this affecting moment consider the fate of edward and think of what may be your own consider the sorrows of louisa and think on what may soon be those of emma yet what have i said  am i not satisfied with the most affectionate and invariable solicitude but i must interfere with a mode of conduct which you assure me is a duty not to be laid aside without dishonor alas henry i am reduced by this cruel commission of yours to a very bitter exigence which neither permits me to censure or approve i dare not write any more for i feel the tide of overwhelming softness pouring on me perhaps i might advise you at this tender crisis to   no i will not trust myself with the pen it would sully me in your esteem should i longer hold it o henry henry pardon and pity me preserve me by preserving yourself give not to glory more than is her due but make some little reserves for the trembling  emma  letter xvi to emma corbett alas what is to be done with this bleeding tenderness of yours for heavens sake temper your sensibility with a little discretion my beloved emma your elegant and affecting pages penetrate me to the soul thetears of anguish mingle with those of admiration as i read them yet let me implore you to strengthen your mind a little lest you wholly debilitate mine let not your henry disgrace the cause he is to defend nor fully the profession he has chosen dear unhappy friend make one great and generous effort to support your drooping spirits to sustain your wasting frame and to preserve a life so valuable to me that the same stroke   i cannot pursue the subject  rouse rouse yourself my emma  for my sake let all your fortitude be exerted we are both young  there is the same protecting providence by water as by land in the fields of war as on the plains of peace the future is a wide space and may contain within its circle a thousand blessings struggle then against the storm bravely your inferences are too gloomy various opportunities will offer doubt not to speed our generous intercourse the wide world of sentiment and sensation still opens upon us by aid of this little friendly instrument we may range through those paths which ocean seems to separate however remote you should still learn to think it a superior blessing that in some part of animated nature there still exists the counterpart of emma  congenial as dear  one whom no circumstance can change but who must ever remain true to every touch of joy and every trembling of woe look emma at the paltry passions and vulgar gratifications of common life  of common lovers look attentively at these and then examine your own heart  examine mine consider the pure nature of the affection that unites them  does not the superiority of our attachment make you generously proud o emma you ought not to be wretched we have both reason to be content  does emma still weep let her rather gratefully acknowledge that though this pure source of sacred amity is occasionally embittered as is more or less every affection of the virtuous heart  there are moments in which happiness breaks forth with a luster that makes amends for every intervening vexation such was the period when i wrote those hasty lines which you have honored with most dear praise in striking the balance then let us not complain my friend but when fretting at disappointment or drooping under the languors of distress let us support ourselves with the assurance that the rich current will return after all obstructions and flow sweetly and smoothly along its proper channels its source my dear emma can never be exhausted it is as the crystal fountain of living water which streams for ever and suffers no impurity to remain upon its surface  ah what is there so likely to melt the spirit of a soldier into cowardice as the tears of emma she will not then give way to the tender torrent she will court the balmy blessings of ease and hope she will check these convulsive transports of distress so destructive to my honor and her own health she will buffet the wild waves of adversity nor thus suffer them to overwhelm her consider of these things o my beloved emma come then my friend be still yourself repose with perfect confidence upon that faithful pillow which my affection prepares for you seek to amuse and to solace cease to murmur and repine  do these things and all your generous wishes shall be rewarded  do these things and all shall be well peace shall revisit your gentle bosom and spread her whitest plumes about your pillow  henry hammond  letter xvii to louisa hammond i can make no terms with this rash brother of yours he is predetermined try your influence for the sake of emma  the sake of your murdered edward  for your own sake and for that of him who would have been your father and who is still your most affectionate friend  charles coreett  letter xviii to c corbett esquire wherefore in the closing scene of my life do you thus agonize me is that consistent with the characters of parent or of friend my brother strongly imagines he is going into the paths of duty  the hapless edward though he trod on the opposite side imagined alas the the same if the intercession of emma fails what can louisa do i every way want power i want every thing but resignation to the sovereign will of heaven to which i have brought myself  do not rob me of it by reviving images which i have neither body or mind to bear  but leave me mr corbett i beseech you leave me to the force of my religious principles without awaking the passions i have lulled on the day that my brother sails i shall set out from this hurrying town for my eternal retirenent  farewell  louisa hammond  letter xviii to henry hammond esquire how sweetly how elegantly you reprove me hammond and how grateful how pleasing are the tears that i have shed over the pages before me i blush to think how far you surpass me henry hope seldom spreads her daydreams over me in those instances where her sweet delusions would be the most acceptable but you have inspired me  poor pathetic louisa what would she give to have edward even in the situation of henry avaunt then impious despair i am easieri am betterinfinitely easier  insinitely better i give you my word and honor that i am yet the dreaded day is always obtruding  it appears like some malignant spirit crossing me at every turn  at every step how perverse is human nature which disposes us to reject the joy in possession and anticipate sorrows which may never come o for the beautiful hour of your return my friend it will arrive henry will it not and in the mean time your sympathizing tenderness shall be salutary  indeed it shall it is  melt you into cowardice did you say heaven forbid eyes instantly be dry  your tears will prove a heresy to the object of my heart o henry you have touched me nearly the consideration  the single consideration of your honor shall reconcile me to a separation go then  pursue the ways of glory  and oh may they lead speedily to peace and  emma  letter xx to emma corbett now then my ever dear emma summon to your aid all your confidence and all your courage the separating moment comes on the sailing orders are received it is the voice of my country that calls upon me  calls in the hour of extremity she summons her sons to arm in her defense shall i not hear  shall i not obey her yesi have the sanction of my friend  i go under the auspices of emmaher approbation is the animating trumpet  her virtue arrays me for the battle methinks i now behold the lovely emma beaming inspiration through beauty standing before me away she cries away henry i yield to the graceful sacrificei lend you to my king i trust you to britain  i give you in charge to that providence on whose equity we shall ultimately have claim i submit go then my henry  farewell  go   as the vessels pass and repass my emma we will faithfully interchange the affectionate enquiries we will with dear tautology repeat the vows which shall one day be solemnized but the parting adieus must this night be paid let me breathe them into your bosom o best of women at the house of the lovely sister of my soul i will write no more let the silent tears of louisa be as a check upon our complaints if patience can comfort her in the hours of despair surely pleasure might smile upon us in the moments of hope consider the nature of the exigence that appeals to my firmness and do not take from me that force  that ardour  that intrepidity  which are publicly due in times like these to your country and to mine adieu  h hammond  letter xxi to henry hammond esquire it may not be my brother i cannot see you in the last hours of your stay in england i love you too dearly to support it it is not even now without pain i hold the pen my tenderness is too strong and my constitution too weak to bear such an interview  to bear the tears of emma the embraces of my brother and my own distress excuse me therefore it is true affection that persuades me to retire i will not unman you nor add to the weight of emmas sympathy i will take my head from this weary pillow and set out for my cottage before you come this illegible scrawl shall be delivered by the servant whom i will leave to attend you my wishes for you need not be repeated you do not want to be told how much i love you yet i have one little request nor will you refuse it to poor louisa  you are going to the spot where the dearest and loveliest of men  suffer me to call him so and do not oppose the voice of party to the language of nature  lies murdered or if you like the term better  lies honorably slain  his memory is precious to me henry  his ashes cannot be indifferent o if you could but find the ground where he fell  if you could but assure me that his sacred relics  if you could but breathe over them one pious tear and one tender sigh  for louisas sake but it is impossible  i feel my weakness and perhaps i shall infect you with it  yet as your bosom is at this time full of love it is fitted for generous actions should therefore kind fortune have allowed amidst the tumults of the war one little commemorating hillock of earth to the remains of edward  o forget not to visit it  forget not to guard it from further violence  forget not it is consecrated by a deluge of tears from a sisters eyes by friendship and by love adieu  louisa hammond  letter xxii to henry hammond esquire the appointment is made and i shall by a lucky arrangement be able to pass with you some hours of elegant distress alas my friend my dear henry nature will insist upon her tribute and i cannot  indeed i cannot  refuse to pay it yet you charm down the genius of grief by strong language and i love you i hope too much to dishonor you about the rights of conquest i know nothing  i only know that as i lost a brother on one side of this bloody question so it is probable i may lose even more than a brother on the other and yet both persuaded me they were in the way of their duty alas how shall reason draw her line on such occasions must not reason be dumb and humanity mourn but i have done women are surrounded by calamities and nothing is left them but to bow in submission to their woe i am indisposed and beg you would allow me as much of this  oh how shall i write it  last evening as you can  emma  letter xxiii emma to her father written in her chamber previous to the interview  you have found then it seems louisas billet making the offer of her house this evening to emma and to henry by what chance the note dropped i am ignorant the hand of agitation is not indeed steady nor can the agonized heart guard against common chances i am not sorry that the paper by whatever means has got into your possession oh my dear father it takes some part of the load from my bosom for i am hurt to appear plotting that which will so thoroughly bear explanation you desire mr hammond to visit me no more he obeys you request that i would without enquiring into reasons forbear to speak of him to you i am obedient you desired that my utmost interest might be tried to keep him from america o you can conjecture how readily and as you know henrys darling passion you may guess how vainly i undertook this the double pleasure of obliging you my father and of gratifying my own fond heart prevailed with me to urge this point till i had well nigh turned his affection to disgust you bid me cease to love and with the utmost ingenuousness i tell you it impossible  impossible my dear father because repugnant to every principle by which all the actions of my life have been governed  my regard  o that is too cold a word  my love for henry is not you know the start of a moment the romantic sally of a warm temper nor the effect of that silly admiration which pays down the tribute of folly to the charms of a red coat i secretly grieve that the profession of arms should have been chosen i have shed too many tears to the memory of my brother to be in love with regimentals but my tenderness was antecedent to all these misfortunes nor will it be in the power of any misfortune to diminish what your judgment and the eloquence of my own heart have so long approved your present avowed displeasure against mr hammond is sudden but settled affection cannot readily accommodate itself to such revolutions what is rooted in nature cannot without much labor be eradicated by art as it displeases you sir i am concerned at this but shall i deceive in order to make my peace shall i be unnatural in order to be filial shall i propensely set one great duty against another and so destroy the excellence of both no you would hate me for it and i should hate myself that i am in this bitter period when i am about to lose what you yourself so lately thought most precious able to write with so much argumentative composure is alas no sign of my indifference but an instance  perhaps the strongest that could be given  of that steady attachment which born of honor is nourished by virtue to be attached is the dictate of nature to be attached to a man of sense and morals is the dictate of delicacy and the symptom i conceive of a good disposition  such my most honored father were the elementary rules i caught from you would you controvert your own maxims or while the merit of the object increases is it a fit time to withdraw from it the love which nature and common sense seem to say should increase in proportion  but you depend i find on the lenitives of absence and the oblivions of time i will not answer for the vigor of my own mind for i know the frailty of our nature if it is soothing to my father to count upon what these things may do let me not destroy his source of expectation i am not thanks to his correcter culture enough the giddy girl to burst forth into asseverations of constancy everlasting merely to vex a parent by setting my heart against his wishes i would desire rather to distrust my own temper and laying my affections open to his view beg him to form his judgment upon a survey of them but i dare not mislead one who has so entire a right to be treated frankly i make no vows yet in proportion as an attachment is deliberate is it not stationary and this being my first and only affection having besides a man of unblemished character and congenial manners for its object have i not a right strongly to suspect  but enjoy the opinion you so strongly adopt bless you my father for the gentleness of your inhibitions you do not threaten  you do not rave these might have augmented my distress but could not have abated my affection a circumstance of which parents seem so unconscious they destroy the effect of authority by the vehemence with which they exert it they confuse but do not convince terrify but do not conciliate and almost justify disobedience by their manner of enforcing duty  oh heaven the clock is striking  the hour is come  the minute  the moment is approaching i will ring for a servant to take this into the parlour my feet will scarcely carry me down stairs an ingenuous nature appeals to you for pity sir  will you refuse oh my father my father my spirits have done their utmost ere the trial is begun suffer me to be unhappy  prepare for me  oh prepare for me the parental hand against my return and do not let my tenderness abate yours adieu  letter xxiv henry to emma after the interview  ten minutes while the chaise is getting ready are mine they shall be devoted to emma check i once more conjure you the extreme of sensibility a few silent tears a few gentle sighs and the luxury of a soft and tender sorrow i wish not to restrain  but such another conflict as that of last night   and yet i feel the absurdity of my own argument  fasten not however on any desponding images we shall meet again and in happier days  the sweets of social and family intercourse shall yet be ours and in the dear bosom of domestic peace we shall enjoy without constraint contrivance or disguise all the benefits of so delicate and well directed an attachment  trust me we shall  ah my emma you owe yourself and me these reasonable encouragements and i implore you to bestow them if emma be not armed with fortitude how can henry expect to conquer it is too mighty a calamity to feel for her and for himself  the moment of departure is come i am called adieu  dearest and most amiable of friends  adieu  hah yonder is your servant  he is running toward me  he is here  a packet precious fellowtraveller i receive it just before i step into the carriage i hurry to press a wafer on this flying billet heaven guard and give you its choicest blessings farewell  ten thousand times farewell  henry hammond  letter xxv to henry hammond esquire yet yet a few words my loved friend and then  what then o adieu for a tedious space  for days weeks months years  perhaps for ever  ah my poor heart  yet it is not so this is the language of drooping nature in her most desolate moment it is our persons only that shall be separated our souls shall be drawn perpetually together in converse sweet communion high  pure as precious  delicate as delightful what alas is space  what is distance our hearts shall know no disunion  i will not i do not despair  henry i am less wretched than i was last night and though full fraught with tender sorrow  though my tears are flowing till they obscure my sight  you may see their traces on the paper  i will have faith in your prophecy  what a day for your journey it is emblematic of our affection inclined to sunshine and to shower to smiles and tears alternately be tender of yourself for my sake guard against cold from the poignant severity of the night air the dangers to which you will professionally be exposed are alas sufficient oh do not add to them by neglect farewell i will think of you very tenderly and pray for you very fervently heaven bless sustain and comfort you how my hand lingers  but time grows short and unless i make one violent effort the period of getting this to your hand may escape  therefore in one decisive and affecting word  farewell  letter xxvi to sir robert raymond my dear baronet i have not yet had one glimpse of opportunity to mention those proposals to my daughter which are so acceptable to me i can only tell you the young man is gone to deal plainly with you she is much attached but when you have cultivated her acquaintance i hope she will be judicious enough to make distinctions follow your design of making my house yours till you go into the country and then many occasions will present themselves of discovering that merit which i am sure the generous emma will not be able to resist i am resolved against hammond so that you need not fear a jarring interest a girl and boy inclination is fugitive sir robert raymond will inspire i trust a superior passion on a superior principle come to us immediately and join in our parties  ever yours charles corbett  letter xxvii to emma corbett i float on the bosom of the ocean while i write this but as if in courtesy the wind is changed or rather it ceases to blow sufficiently and in this harbor we are to ride till it rises you well know in what manner i shall employ the interval it shall be dedicated to softness and to emma i have perused your dear parting legacy  no not legacy that is too funereal a word  your parting pledge  yes i have perused it and soldier as i am do not blush to tell you that i have wept over its contents i pressed it with servent and chaste ardour to my lips and to my bosom  i laid it soft and close upon the panting heart and am relieved  as much so my emma as i ought to be or as is consistent with human nature at this crisis oh my dear friend it is indeed a pathetic period i now feel that i had set myself too hard a task i pretended to rally it off as a military manceuvre but i find he jests at scars that never felt a wound nature revolted and i have suffered more from not giving her fair play there is no brother officer at my elbow and i may safely whisper forth my lovely weakness to emma the anguish of my mind   the anguish of my mind bore down all before it and now the matter is over i will confess that the last hour i passed in your company my friend was the most painful of my life how are you at this moment my emma o how many questions have i omitted  how many have i yet to ask o for another hour at the end of the first stage i was strongly inclined to order the postillion to drive back i had recollected much and that methought of moment too to say  but i found it was only lingering nature reluctant to let go its object and would have amounted to nothing more than tender repetition it would but have enseebled both and deepened in each bosom the poignancy of sorrow again my dear emma farewell may heaven bring us once more within reach of each other  you such as i wish you me such as you would have me i shall now seek the bed or rather the hammock it is somewhat awkward to me the sea is not you know a soldiers element and it will take a little time ere i can fit myself to the fatigues of it  henry hammond ps o be very tender to my beloved louisa supply a brothers absence nurse her declining health draw as if by stealth the softest images over the solemn sadness of her soul and let not so much beauty elegance and virtue drop untimely into the grave    letter xxviii to henry hammond esquire the wind stirs not there is not a breath of air moving in the atmosphere under favor of this idea i am writing a hasty line just to wrap up with the enclosed which my heart recollected since your departure let it lie o my beloved henry upon yours and may it have all the tender power which i wish to give it ah that i could crowd into a few words every thing sweet and comfortable to supply the defect of this brevity and to soften the ills and misfortunes which poor humanity is doomed to bear  emma  letter xxix to louisa hammond ohow tenderly you have spoken to a brothers feelings my beautiful sister it is a nice subject you have glanced upon but what is there in your henrys power that he will not seek to do for louisa yet it was hard to withdraw your hand from me  i missed the pressure even while emma was weeping on my bosom and i had much very much for your private ear which i would have contrived to impart preserve the enclosed papers which in case of accident you will unseal and act in conformity to their contents they are the last desires of your affectionate brother  henry hammond  letter xxx to emma corbett the wind is still insufficient and the little which stirs is adverse which has given me an opportunity to receive the only part of your person that could consistently attend me on the ocean do you know that this dear locket has made me poetical you must allow for verses written upon the waves yet i hate apology they have soothed a pensive hour for me and may do the same for you  that they may answer this good purpose is the fondest desire of  henry hammond  address to a locket with a braid of emmas hair  i come thou soft and sacred favor the remembrance chaste impart take thy station on my bosom lightly lodging near the heart ii while that tender thing shall flutter thou the secret cause shall know whether pleasure or disaster thou will see what stirs it so iii when the hope of happy tidings shall the sweet sensations move when the white and winged agents whisper friendship whisper love iv then all sympathetic thrilling thou the rosy stream shall guide while as runs the ruddy treasure you are the genius of the tide v happily when this heart is sinking thou shall soothe the rising sigh when with woe surcharged it is heaving thou will see the reason why vi every curious eye escaping here securely shall thou rest though the universe were searching thine the secrets of my breast vii come then dear and decent favor learn what thou will never impart fix thy throne and fix it ever on the regions of my heart viii over these delicate dominions cast a monarchs careful view render every subject passion worthy me and worthy you ix let not realms so rich so tender suffer rebel weeds to grow but the flowers  ah do not crush them in sweet vision let them blow x gentlest sighs shall serve for breezes softly aid them auburn friend silent tears like dews descending shall the lovely growth attend xi thou shall watch them night and morning thou shall see the nurselings rise thou with me shall tremble for them thou with me invoke the skies xii if at length alas they wither if they sicken if they die in one grave  oh dear companion still embosomd will we lie letter xxxi to c corbett esquire the prospect corbett is not clear i find but something impels me to try whether it may not be improved i suspect however that a youth of twentyfive in scarlet will leave an impression scarce to be erased by a middleaged man in a suit of snuffcolour with slash sleeves after the manner of our ancestors and it is too late now charles to throw off a custom that has hung on my back for more than twenty years yet i will come for i want the stability of domestic comfort after all my migrations  your daughter strikes me as the very woman and has in my eye no other fault than that of being too young which i quarrel with chiefly because i strongly suspect she will think me too old no matter i will put the best foot forward and be with you in a day or two mean time i will get me a new wig and to show you how much i am in earnest will try to deceive your emma as much as conveniently may be by ordering it to be made so as to resemble a responsible head of hair for i find since i came home from india there is nothing in a young ladys eyes so ridiculous as a wig and when i left my native land a flowing peruke was a cupid in full dress o tempora but we will see what can be done  dear friend i am yours and remember i have been so twentyeight years  robert raymond  letter xxxii to henry hammond esquire what a return have you made for the trifle i sent you o most dear and ingenious friend ever directing the current of that rich stream which knows no diminution but scatters fertility and fragrance as it flows to comfort to amuse or to instruct me how i rejoice that the bagatelle pleased you it was my first intention to have the hair disposed into an ornament for the shirt but i considered the nature of that delicate sentiment you feel for emma i reflected that it was retired that it shunned every thing obtrusive that it could ill brook the idle and perhaps the wanton curiosity of those cockaded heroes who imagine tenderness incompatible with bravery on these accounts therefore i chose to suit my locket to that situation only in which your delicate partiality would be most likely to place it  round your neck my dear henry let it ever hang impervious to every eye but that of the proprietor  a sacred talisman may it prove  a soft shield thrown over your bosom by the trembling hand of a friend  o that i could breathe upon it all the virtues that were supposed to be in possession of the most benevolent genii  that it had strength of charm sufficient to preserve you as securely from sickness sorrow and mischance  from the bullet and the sword  as i do firmly believe the sight and touch of it will arm your heart against the impression of every error and the practice of every irregularity  your letter with its fair and tuneful enclosure found me upon my pillow from which i hastened with a rapidity which is the spontaneous impulse of unaffected tenderness like a much wishedfor and much wanted cordial it found me in an affecting moment i read and recovered wept and was well oh wondrous power of virtuous affection yes thou admirable and honorable friend the die is cast your invaluable love shall be the sustaining taining solace of my future existence ah may no jarring word or discordant thought ever rise up to disturb an amity so sacred and so pure the fine spirit of our esteem my henry shall extend its delicate influence over all the rougher passages on a sea far more stormy than that whose bosom is now pressed by your vessel  over every troubled moment our affection shall softly diffuse itself  like the sweet breezes of the south stealing and giving odor oh henry my heart dilates as i write and the soft drops descend in a pathetic and sweet assurance of our future felicity but do not be uneasy that i weep  such tears will not hurt me they are precious drops that invigorate virtue and freshen as they fall oh those sacred hours we have passed together in friendship in converse in books no divided attention thought saluting thought the mutual tear every thing or dear or elegant included in every moment carry the remembrance of such intercourse over the world of waters call to mind the time when our lengthened attention to the moral page instead of relaxing grew stronger and more fixed when our understandings and our hearts seemed equally to refine and to expand  yes henry i will try to adopt that gentle spirit of prophecy which breathes so beautiful an ardour over your consolatory pages i do not expect to gather the bloom of the rose without feeling the puncture of the surrounding thorn i gratefully take it with all its little wounding appendages  i place it in my bosom   i have promised not to repine yet if a gentle murmur sometimes escapes let me i prithee find indulgence for it and do not chide me oh how often have i wished since your departure to be the companion of your voyage and all its consequences however multiplied however menacing and after all henry your situation is more tolerable than mine the traveling friend has the advantage of those who are left in solitude behind the very velocity of the motion is favorable in passing rapidly along the freshness of the air and the change of objects engage and divert the mind insensibly while the poor forlorn one that remains fixed to the former residence has only to mark the present period to look in vain around for what is lost to cast a longing lingering eye upon the past and in the torture of reflection to confess that such things were but are alas no more  it was my fortune to pass through the street where you resided more than once since your departure o think with what emotions i viewed those windows which belonged to an apartment so lately yours the sight of your grave could scarcely have produced any thing more affecting and yet i feel that i shall like to pass often by them i do not pretend to account for these little touches i only simply relate them will not your feeling nature easily explain them  and now confess hammond that i have arrived at the due degree of heroism confess that i am sufficiently soldierd for i can hold the pen and impress the quietseeming sentiment with my eyes full of tears and my heart full of sorrow what more can you expect from female philosophy what more can you expect from a friend who has been used to regret the absence of an hour as a misfortune  i shall send off this on the slight chance of its reaching you if it should not  what then  what will be its fate  i care not gross as is the world were every sentiment of my soul laid open to its view i could support the scrutiny i still could boast the graceful weakness if indeed it be a weakness of my heart the possibility of your receiving my letter is worth the hazard of dispatching it and as every moment is now at the caprice of the wind i will no longer delay sealing adieu  emma  letter xxxiii to emma corbett your dear favor like a parting blessing comes to hand while the breezes are rising and the whole crew are engaged in the bustle of preparation we have already weighed anchor the sails will soon cease to flap against the mast for i perceive the mariners are climbing the shrouds to square the canvass to the gale which is at length favorable all hands are aloof  all hearts are panting with various passions  i feel that we are in motion  i can hear the cleaving keel cut the waves  the wind blows fresher as we clear the calms that brood in the harbor and as i turn my eye astern of the vessel i behold the billows whiten into foam alas the shore seems to go back and we are getting into a wider sea the watermen who have followed us thus far in their boat on some necessary business now tack about and prepare again to fetch the harbor  brief let me be  many of my fellow officers are standing idle on the deck and some are roaring catches in the cabin while henry hammond is writing an adieu to one dear woman who is the pride and pleasure of his life i confess also that a sigh is heaving from my heart and a tear is running along my cheek the officers look at me as if they suspected an infirmity let them in the day of battle we shall see whether tenderness or dissipation inspire the truer courage and magnanimity i have a little bribed the boatmen who are rowing laboriously after us but the last last moment is come and the last last adieus the finishing farewell must be given  farewell then i leave you in full possession of my heart i leave you to your own virtue and to the providence of god  henry hammond  letter xxxiv to emma corbett my brother and your friend then is gone how fares it with you my dear emma are the conflicting pangs of a parting so poignant somewhat subsided the tender spirits somewhat composed the fluttered agitated heart more still i ask you these questions in the bosom of my retreat i date from my sanctuary where my widowed heart for that has been long wedded is retired to muse upon the dead of the living you one other person and henry are the only objects of my care for your welfare and for your distress i can yet feel and while you remain in it the world will have something that ties me to it  the rest is edwards  fifteen months of desperation are gone by my friend and five more have followed those less clamorous but more deep the frenzy of my soul is succeeded by the still small sigh and silent tear of settled sorrow it is not now the passion but the principle of grief here i sit under the dark umbrage of these sepulchral boughs  ah shade most satred and invoke piety to consecrate my grief  she comes  she comes my emma   amidst the modest shadings of the evening i behold her celestial form deseending on a moonbeam even now she diffuses a holy melancholy into my heart  she fits me for the contemplations that are most dear  she utters the name of edward in tones of heavenly eloquence  she touches the tender strain  she echoes the penfive sigh in softest cadence and increases the stream of woe with cherub drops of sympathy the lovely enthusiasm is complete  it is now twilight my emma the bat is taking its circles in the air and poor fidelio is sleeping at my feet  i use the days last moment to write supporting the paper on my lap  the owl which shrinks from sunshine has left his ivy and flits by me  the village bell is tolling  this night departed the soul of a widow  it is the passing bell then that i hear  oh heavens  alas i meant to comfort you and i shall infect you with my gloom   the present sombre sweets be mine  adieu  i lay down the pen till i can use it to a more soothing purpose  in continuation it is particularly unlucky emma for you that i should have contracted this sequestered habit when my soothing cares might be so particularly acceptable to my friend  yet in the present situation of her heart all attuned as it is to gentle emotions i am much inclined to ask her society  the retreat is tender the weather is fair close upon my cot simplicity seems to have fixed her seat of dearest residence she has sequestered herself in a bower of shrubs at whose roots rambles the fertilizing rill my shades are formed to receive and to embrace the gentle spirit of acquiescence reposed in the thickest foliage the saintly form of melancholy also is there listening to the plaint of the stock dove and to the soft gradations of the waterfall is not this an asylum for the heart of emma even louisa ah how preeminently wretched  finds some consolation amongst these pensive sweets of nature in her solitudes  solitudes my friend not to annihilate but compose not to extinguish the generous flame but to attemper it ah come then  come to the woman who esteems you  come to the sister of henry  come to the mourner of edward retirement is the nurse of love it is hereabouts she dwells virtuous affection is blooming here amidst roses friendship ah surely i might say kindred friendship in the form of your louisa attends what of fost of sacred of serene is there wanting to invite you here as farther removed from the tumults of busy life you will be drawn more near to henry directing the telescope of imagination only toward him you will seem to approximate almost all of life that is most precious to us both the pure air itself will assist the softness of morn and the serenity of eve will be alike auspicious  the sigh will become more soft  the violent agitations will subside  the tempestuous passions will sink into a delicate calm like the smooth sea when not a breath of wind blows over the sursace  a little time passed in a recess so soothing will answer a thousand good purposes at present i know the tender heart must feel and the feeble frame will suffer with it my own misery is not noisy and it will not interrupt yours the tears of sympathy which happily you may bestow upon louisa shall be gratefully repaid in this way we will be at once indebted and discharged  attain therefore your fathers assent and hasten to the cottager  louisa hammond nb i return the verses which henry sent with the packet of pens because i cannot bear to keep any thing that is comfortable from you at this period especially any thing from our beloved hammond whom we divide in dear affections between us    verses from mr hammond to emma with a present of some pens given at parting  ii go ingenious artists to her all ambitious to be pressed dear

this charge upon you passing tender passing dear oh the charge you bear is wondrous gentle agents be sincere letter xxxv to frederick berkley esquire frederick he is set off but i have no reason to imagine his embarkation a good omen as far as the fathers interest goes i am safe but that does not go very far to tell you the truth i am myself somewhat an odd kind of a fellow in this respect i should not choose to accept an alienated or reluctant hand nor could i sit quiet under the idea of possessing a woman who gave her person as an equivalent for a title and a fortune these niceties you will say are at my age some what out of date and i ought not to expect such etiquettes will be attended to by afine young woman whom perhaps you imagine i might jump at on any terms looky frederick leave me to settle my own singularies and do you settle yours i think fit for old acquaintance sake to unbosom to you a very foolish secret the least you can do is to hear my story and to let me tell it my own way i am now in love nolens volens you may laugh but i feel it is not in my power to extricate myself would the wench had not fallen in my way these are what i call cross incidents when a man is jogging on and has got soberly to the resting place then to have a slap on the shoulder from such an urchin as cupid then to be attacked bow and arrow in hand  is not this too bad  is not this too ridiculous  too humiliating  after you have uttered the sarcastic yes i shall proceed to acquaint you that this mighty ridiculous thing is the most serious torment and what renders it the more perplexing is that old fellow as i am it is a circumstance wholly new to me  not more so to the veriest stripling when he wastes from him the maiden sighs for a tripping chit of fifteen i am not in my dotage am i berkley at fortythree no hang it that is not what they call being wellstricken  is it i have some terms to keep with myself too i should not choose to be too absurd  but this young adventurer this happy hero the parts of his character that i have been able to pick up  such as health agreeableness genius spirit courage and animation are not absolutely in my favor are they frederick  let us see what i have got to put in the balance against them the gout  smallpox pits  not the ninetieth part of a muse  less courage than caution and spirits somewhat harrassed out in the real wear and tear of worldly events i dont like it frederick it will not do my lighter scale is hurled aloof and i am bouncing my head against the beam most abominably o frederick  is there then nothing to throw in by way of bringing a middleaged gentleman on the equilibrium yes a lusty lump of money the golden makeweight of fifty thousand pounds fair force of metal frederick our cockaded spark has not any thing to poise that in the opinion of the world and yet if this should happen to be emmas opinion i am so whimsical a mortal that i should esteem her less for the very circumstance which would make my suit more successful the the fortune of henry hammond i find is small he has not much money but he has what does a thousand times more execution in a delicate bosom he has sentiment o that cursed sentiment  a term frederick of late invention to express old emotions in a new way  a term which many use more affect few understand and still fewer feel  a term which  which  in short  curse that sentiment  we deceive ourselves my friend and in my next i will tell you how good by for the present  yours robert raymond  letter xxxvi to the same i said i would tell you how we deceive ourselves i will the slender circumstances and even the great misfortunes of a lover are no kind of objection in the eyes of a sentimental mistress embarassments of the world call forth the finer sentiments and those excite sympathy now sympathy frederick is in the female breast a very tender sensation it is a strange thing but a true that this same adorable sentiment has ever had with indeed very few exceptions a most sore quarrel with solid silver and gold and with the coin current of a country in the account of young english women who are the greatest worshippers of the fair idol it really circulates as most sterling and the prevailing charms of a pathetic poetical poverty is a more welcome draft to them than any which mere matteroffact wealth could draw upon his banker thus it is that fathers sacrifice to plutus and children especially daughters to a beggarly deity whom plutus laughs to scorn and hence the source of tenthousand family feuds  hence the rise of separate maintenance and the fall of domestic confidence sentimental love is torn almost to tatters in his way to the altar and when in this effort his robe is most ragged then is his glory the most distinguished for thus beggarly as he is he shall laugh at the labors of a rich passion and as he passes povertystruck as it should seem through files of females he will flaunt his famine in your face and sentimentally tell you it is his letter of recommendation and all this frederick while plain affection in a snuffcoloured coat for instance throws in vain the massy money bag across his shoulders and seeks hymens temple by the path that is obvious and unentangled nowadays the broad highway is deserted and the women rather choose to stick those roses in the bosom that are encompassed by thorns than accept the richest boquet in the garden that lies open to the view ready to the hand and that may be collected without any difficulty  difficulty there it is again that is another cursed thing which enters into the spirit of a modern attachment it is the first cousin of sentiment or as i have heard its parent a sly old neighbor of mine who has looked shrewdly and silently at human nature and whom i sometimes used to consult on that subject tells me that difficulty is the happiest thing in the world to sentimental lovers i hinted to my friend in reply to this that i then might consider my age my dark complexion my wig and my fair round body as so many points in my favor since they would no doubt throw a respectable quantity of the aforesaid difficulty in the way of my wishes meaning my overtures to emma corbett aye quoth my friend  but they are not the right sort of difficulties there are continued he difficulties which impede and difficulties which advance of the former yours sir robert happen to be the most substantial to which you might have added many more that have the kindness to attend you of the latter you sir robert to my recollection have not one for you are too rich to experience an objection on the side of cash which by incurring the contempt of the father might possibly recommend you to the child you are too sleek and too plump to make a young lady mistake your countenance for the seat of sentiment and there is so terrible an air of plenty all over you that you are in my opinion an unwise baronet to address any thing but one of those prudent young ladies which in a matrimonial bargain cling to the solid comforts and will not like you the worse for being so abundantly provided with the goods of this life  but to attempt a woman of sentiment an attached woman of sentiment the mistress of a young soldier who loves a man of poverty  a man of poetry  and to crown all who loves a man that is not the present choice of her father  alas poor sir robert you may think yourself well off if she does not conceive toward you a generous kind of aversion and order you to assume a genteel size to wear your own hair and to adopt the melting mood before she suffers a second visit thus spoke my friend  and i dont know what to think of his doctrine give her up i positively cannot gain her is not a little improbable yet i have met her several times since my arrival and she has not yet ordered me to assume a genteel size nor to wear my own hair i design to make some little alterations in the headway it is true but this is more in frolic than seriousness for i love to adopt little drolleries they belong to my temper and have accompanied me to a very good end through life  which i really find requires many little lifts to go pleasantly through  it is on this account frederick that i regret having seen the fair emma corbett my partiality is not i find such a one as i can accommodate to my old habit of quaint jocularity it has a little jarred the harmony of my little system already i do not enjoy the passing scene quite so carefree  and why should i disguise any thing from frederick berkley  i feel an earnest desire to touch the heart of this girl so that i should be as necessary to her felicity as she is to mine and the fear of not being able to accomplish this makes me at times most peculiarly miserable thank discretion however she knows as yet nothing of the matter and i shall have the advantage soon of being under the same roof i could treat her with great tenderness indeed i could frederick  before i quite accede to the invitation  though i have written to corbett  i will consider about it and shall be glad to hear from you in the mean time but you need not write any of your objections to my pursuit lest you inspire me with a love of difficulty and i should like a sentimental lover exert myself to oppose them in proportion as they appear insurmountable but you may send me word i am engaged in a hazardous undertaking not doubting my success if you please so i am  yours robert raymond  letter xxxvii to emma corbett ah my friend you must not come  i am not now fit to receive you i am too gloomy and too sick my constitution will not keep pace with my mind  the physician summons me from hence o i would willingly live and die here but a certain something which at this crisis i am not at liberty to tell even to thee my emma makes it a duty for me to protract life if it be possible and even to love it i can say no more and you are too generous to torture me with an enquiry  adieu  louisa hammond ps i shall see you in town soon    letter xxxviii to mrs arnold your billet o caroline is arrived  surely the agony which threatens will not be added to the rest if it be the shortness of its continuance will soften its severity for in that case the tender mercies of god will be upon me and i shall die ere this letter reaches you i will myself embrace all that remains of   o caroline caroline  tears and terror prevent me from proceeding  the post is setting out and i have time only to announce the journey of  louisa hammond  letter xxxix to louisa hammond prior to the receipt of the above  by all that is valuable to you i enjoin the utmost expedition since i wrote in the morning the causes of apprehension are increased if the memory of edward be dear to you lose not a moment  c arnold  letter xl to louisa hammond previous to receiving the   th letter  we differ about the rural shades my friend i adopt the poets opinion concerning them  what are the falling rills the pendent shades the morning bowers the evening colornades but soft recesses for the uneasy mind to sigh unheard in to the passing wind so the struck deer in some sequestered part lies down to die the arrow in his heart there hid in shades and wasting day by day inly he bleeds and pants his soul away but were i even to suppose with you that solitude my dear louisas pathetically precious solitude would woo to it the tender form of patience it would at this period be impossible to take refuge like the hapless deer amongst the branches i have not been allowed a minutes breathingtime since the news of henrys embarkation reached me it seems now the great point of my father to dislodge entirely all traces of mr hammond a fathers heart engages in this endeavor and though i know it to be hopeless i forbear to disturb his plan by unavailing contest and am passive to the projects which surround ah how vainly the honorable affiction of my bosom the acute pang my friend is subsided but my affection is only the more fixed upon that account all places being now pretty much alike i suffer myself to be drawn about from one silly circle to another yet how should my father thus mistake my temper this affection is no impromptu  no enthusiastic flight of folly fancy or of passion it has been the slow progressive course of various combining and irresistible circumstances  circumstances which unfolding themselves trait by trait have discovered to me the merit of a most amiable character and on the basis of experience fixed me to it beyond all possibility of change so very complex peculiar and precious louisa has been every movement in the series of events which have contributed to cement and fasten the faith  the holy faith established between emma and your brother that though no particular predestinarian nor easily yielding to the wild images of superstition i am strongly inclined to think  and there is my hope  that something more powerful than the mere random agency of chance must have interfered i am not of the light or fickle tribe nor am i tumultuous extreme violence i dread that pathetic sobriety which is separated on the one hand from the darkness of despair and on the other from the perilous furor of extacy if i at all know myself discriminates my character to the fortunes of mr hammond i am tied by those fine bonds of sympathy upon which time and chance can have no influence wherefore then should i not give way to the generous instinct you have often heard me say that i respect and venerate every rule which reason has prescribed to render female conduct correctly amiable and to preserve that beauteous decorum without whose graces woman is both despicable and wretched but does reason bid us withhold the mitigating balm which is given us to heal the wounds of life no my friend your own heart virtuously attached to the memory of a most lovely and most lamented youth will plead in my behalf and justify my constancy heaven itself will justify it and so will the unchangeable god who inhabits that heaven  to delicacy i grant much to qustom all which she ought to expect but to nature chastened and regulated by real virtue i devote my heart in devoting it to them i dedicate it to henry and it is with equal pride and pleasure i am able to inform the sister of my dear hammond that such has been the delicacy of his manners so uniformly pure his sentiments his tenderness so adorned by dignity so becoming a man to offer and a woman to accept  ardent yet steady and soft yet bright  that i do not recollect one word either spoken or written which dying i could wish to blot from the tablature of my memory if this was the praise of the poet what shall it be of the lover  of the lover young interesting approved of the most susceptible heart and a soldier and is ones affection for such a man to obey the motion of wheels and fly off as they roll along or is it to be buried in the grave of everyday society or is it even to be given up for the gaudiest trappings of tinsel life which never even at the most unengaged moment could fafcinate the eyes or sway the opinions of emma  o vain thought o impotent exertion would my father have me flutter into forgetfulness it is impossible let him rather present to me a man more amiable more perfect more tender more engaging and more ingenious than hammond let him introduce to me a second henry superior to the first or let him forbear attempting to erase that lovely leaf whereon the virtues of that first are inscribed yet i hold myself not at liberty to oppose the system of my father i maintain the modest purpose of my soul and cherish the vow which in the presence of an attesting god i have registered in my heart but i do not set myself avowedly against the pursuits of a parent at the same time i should esteem myself the lightest as well as the most unworthy of women were such pursuits to have any influence upon my faith time may convince my father of the propriety of a constancy so inflexible and to that i trust  may heaven augment the comforts of us both louisa  adieu  letter xli to c corbett esquire help me corbett for i am a poor plain soul to conquer a little scruple or rather to obviate it that done but first that must be done i am at your service and will be at your house for i am tired of this tavern life in two hours now then for it  be honest  how stands the matter betwixt you and young hammond is he gone under the seal of any promise received from you i do not ask what emma has declared she will answer me herself when i venture to refer to her but i want to know whether you as her father have given him at parting any mark of approbation i must not be considered by these young folks as an impertinent old fellow who presumes upon sum of money and a paltry piece of titleship and so in the end become the object of derision to a whole family i understand that during my long residence abroad this hammond was under your guardianship that he lived with you and emma some years in the very house called castleberry which i have purchased of you that there the young man was countenanced by you and his addresses to your daughter not disapproved now as i do not hear of his having done any thing to forseit your affections i cannot not conceive why you have as you say resolved against him  to be ingenuous i am afraid you think i am a better match looky charles i am no hero but an honest man and you shall not break your word as many a very honest man has done in compliance with certain rigorous circumstances  let us talk like old friends newly met  on my leaving england i was poor and you was rich in the roll of human affairs perhaps now that i am returned rich you may be comparatively poor  that is you may have somewise scheme to carry and cannot well bring it about i can no otherway account for this sudden change in disfavour of hammond  for you used to be fixed in your opinions  than that impelled to an alteration by distressing incidents you  in short is there any hard part in your situation which you imagine an alliance with me might remove and but for this would not hammond be as much the object of your choice as he is that of your daughter  corbett speak plain what cash do you want let not your necessities violate your engagements condescend to be a borrower where you may so safely rely upon your lender and where by contracting a debt you may confer an obligation to plead for a rival would be unnatural  but to save a friend from error and myself from disgrace is not amiss  an old and intimate friend of yours happened to step in just as i was directing my servant to carry my luggage to your house your name was no sooner mentioned than he exclaimed  poor corbett how miserable must he be at the departure of young hammond who is betrothed to his daughter emma the youth is just gone a volunteer to america and if in that enterprise he be not shot he is to marry on his return corbett doats upon him and a fine young spirited fellow he is   this startled me but i said nothing i apply for explanation to you dear charles let neither your preference of me nor your private affairs aught avail i had rather be very unhappy than at all ridiculous my friendship is at your service just as you have occasion to shape it only i am sure on a little reflection you will not offer to give it the inhospitable form of infringing the rights of another farewell  robert raymond  letter xlii to sir robert raymond you force me into a very unwelcome explanation unwelcome because precipitate and which i designed to have opened at a proper opportunity in the hour of confidence  however as the circumstance is thus hastened on i must suit myself to it  i am not by any means so rich as i was at your departure from this country for india yet i am too rich  and should think myself so had i only one guinea upon the earth  to many emma to your fortune to mend mine i did love hammond even with a fathers love and in a legal sense to be his father was my favorite intention yet that idea is now of all others the farthest from my mind and never can be revived it is a little hard that you have got me into such an exigence as to make it impossible for me with any credit to keep the great secret of my life  henry hammond is against all advice and persuasion violently attached to those cruel spoilers who have gone sword in hand into the bowels of a country where my dear son has fallen a victim  a country which is most barbarously butchered and to whose welfare i am bound by ties the most tender and interesting i would reject you i would reject an emperor that should pretend to the hand of emma and yet sacrilegiously pollute his own hand in the lifeblood of america oh thou hapless land thou art precious to me beyond the breath which i am now drawing  beyond every hope that i can form on this side heaven  beyond my daughter  yes even beyond emma because thou art equally the object of my love and more of my pity the rapacious henry is gone to plunge another poignard in thy bosom  the bosom of my country  the tomb of emmas brother and the vault of every generous affection nature herself lies bleeding on thy shore and there the inhuman mother has plunged the dagger with her own barbarous hand into the bowels of her child   but oh the deep and tremendous restitutions are at hand i see them with a prophetic eye this moment before me horrors shall be repaid with accumulation of horror the wounds in america shall be succeeded by deepmouthed gashes in the heart of britain the chain of solemn consequences advance yet yet my friend a little while and the poor forlorn one who has fought and fallen at the gate of her proper habitation for freedom  for the common privileges of life  for all the sweet and binding principles in humanity  for father son and brother  for the cradled infant the wailing widow and the weeping maid yet yet a little while and she shall find an avenger indignant nations shall arm in her defense  thrones and dominions shall make her cause their own and the fountains of blood which have run from her exhausted veins shall be answered by a yet fuller measure of the horrible effusion blood for blood and desolation for desolation o my poor edward  my buried property  my massacred america  you remember it was amongst my first questions that i desired to know your opinion of the war i received the answer which soothed my heart and it was not till after that moment i suffered my full tide of ancient tenderness again to flow  to henry i break no promise emmas attachment i think may be subdued by gentle means o if she still unites her heart even her secret heart to that volunteer murderer these silver hairs shall descend in sudsden sorrow to the grave but indeed i do not apprehend it she is all duty she loves the source of her existence come then discover to her your virtues and try to save me from the distress of her preferring a rash boy who is bent upon destroying those which are so valuable to  your charles corbett  letter xliii to c corbett esquire you astonish me i imagined you were like myself a citizen of the earth and of no particular party for my own part i have traveled away all enthusiasm of the sort you mention there is indeed something like a natural affection which one bears to the place of ones nativity because there our beings were first linked to the chain of society  there first shot up our ideas  there grew our connexions our affections our hopes and our wishes  there our little loves were first formed and our little wants first accommodated it is upon these accounts that i am more happy to contemplate the scenes of england than those of india  that i rate more highly my own than i do a foreign language  that i look with fondest partiality at the spot which is marked in everlasting traces on the memory devoted to the pastimes of my infancy and that i continue some sort of grateful tenderness for the very trees whose shades so often soothed me in the summer of my childhood my predilection for my native country friend corbett hath this extent  no more it has been my fate to travel  i had almost said  wherever europeans are dispersed i have traveled too where civil society has yet made no progress but i have never traveled and oh may i never where the human face divine did not meet my eye however varied by color by tint and by feature i saw enough to discover my kind and to acknowledge it i disputed not about the white or black the tawny or the yellow nor about the different mixture shade or distinction of these  i saw beings of the same erect form  i saw my species and in this very serious moment i declare to you that i felt attachment to the general figures of men and women wherever i beheld them even before i knew any thing of their particular dispositions in looking more close i beheld amongst every people whether savage or civilized many things to like and many to dislike but not one to cut them wholly from my tenderness foremost of those points corbett which hurt me were the bickerings that subsisted between one state and another in passing through a variety of countries and seeing them all either engaging preparing to engage or healing the wounds of an engagement past i began to think the passion for honorable death ie cutting throats and lopping limbs for subsistence or for glory for pride or pique was universally peculiar to these ages of iron and steel till devoting a cool hour to examine the map of the world and perceiving that from the creation or very soon after even unto this day to shed blood in this manner has been the constant practice i gave up the idea of calling my fellow creatures cruel or sanguinary upon this account and deplored a custom which i could not approve yet in every army are characters to be loved and the human affections spread themselves more or less over every clime in considering the causes of wars between different proportions of the same species of whom numbers without number have been slain i have found them so wretchedly inadequate to the horrible effects that i have often melted into tears but never have been inflamed with anger tens of thousands my friend have been sacrificed to the frown of a favorite the whim of a prince or the smile of a prostitute the occasions are contemptible but the event is murder what can a goodnatured man do but commiserate the abuse of power and the madness of ambition in point of propriety there is seldom a pin to choose on either side and even when it is justice herself that draws the sword and heads the phalanx the blood of many an innocent is shed in the contest and in the warmest moment of success while victory is enjoying her jubilee  if all the milk of human kindness were not drained out of the heros bosom  there is as much cause for him to sorrow as to rejoice oh mr corbett were he to retire after the shout of acclamation to some quiet solitude and there think on the means by which the conquest has been gained  were he to consider that heaps of his countrymen as well as of the enemy all of whom were human beings lie cut to pieces upon the plain  while another heap yet more to be regretted are groaning in hospitals  would not the laurel wither on his brow would not the sense of rapture be checked sympathy stream from his eye and recoiling horror freeze up the blood about his heart such are my opinions i caught them my friend from the fountainhead of a most touching experience they flowed immediately from the wounds of my fellow creatures appointed to the office of surgeon at a period of war in the earlier part of my life it was the fortune of our ship more than once to feel the shocks of public hostility i had so much business upon my hands that it was almost too much for my heart at the conclusion of the voyage an opportunity offered to quit my cruel station and i readily embraced it since that time i have kept myself unengaged from scenes for which nature did not form me and i am not of any party i detest war and the thoughts of war but i sincerely wish well to every human creature that england is at variance with her colonies is unhappy in both countries i have friends who are dear to me in both i have property but i dare not lean either way lest i should unsettle that system of general loving kindness which for a great while has been the basis of my happiness i assiduously avoid political conversation and it is a certain prudence in your conduct which seldom suffers you to mention these things that makes me so pleased my dear corbett with your society i am now too far advanced in life to begin the cares of a partizan but as i have some feelings i cut out some more congenial employment for them i love my jest i love my friend i love you and i love your daughter your ardent principles now convince me that an alliance with hammond would be to unite fire with fire i will therefore try for her fathers sake and for mine how far emma may be brought to like a man of peace i have only to desire that you will consider me as one who remains neuter upon the same principle that you take a side viz because i think it is right and because i feel it to be happy this condition observed our ancient friendship will stand firm and i shall ever be  yours robert raymond  letter xliv to sir robert raymond agreed had hammond remained neuter on motives of like benevolence i should still have loved a name which is now detestable so i beg you will not utter it again for my own part i cannot remain neuter my soul is on fire  i breathe generous vengeance against barbarous britain i own it and could i move this lacerated body out of england without immediate peril of a life on which my emma has a claim i would not continue in a soil so accursed we now know each others opinion and the subject disorders me so much when it is brought forward that i most readily acquiesce in your wishes to drop it for ever my feelings must ever remain but it kills me to give them language come directly i have prepared emma for the society of an amiable man and have explained our long and intimate connection adieu  c corbett  letter xlv to louisa hammond you alarm and check my curiosity in the same moment oh beautiful unfortunate yet is it not a little hard to have any concealments with the sister of edward and the avowed admirer of henry particular circumstances however justify what in general ones would be an unkindness and these i am convinced sanctify the silence of louisa sacred and embosomed beyond the reach of any participation be all that you desire to keep so i wait in patient tenderness the moment of fuller confidence and till that arrives will only assure you that i am connected with every turn of your life and with every stroke of your fortunes but will suffer myself to make no more the premature enquiry all this i owe you in return for the solicitude you express for the welfare of emma whose chief pleasure on this side the separating sea consists in the correspondence which she maintains with louisa  after several days of tedious revelry the hurry into which my heart has been precipitated somewhat subsides we have left the vapors of london and got into a serener system the house of a very old friend of my fathers lately landed from india is now our residence and it was once the residence of emma and of henry for it is that very castlebury where my father who has since sold it to the present proprietor had used to pass with his elected friends some months of every summer since his american misfortunes  o pardon me the mention of them  he detests the country and has i find sold the whole property to the agent employed to provide a country house and some pleasure grounds for sir robert raymond that is his name previous to his arrival in england the agent fixed upon this spot and it became the seat of sir robert before my father knew that it was to be inhabited by a friend sir robert is delighted with the purchase and my father rejoices to see a domain that he once loved so properly disposed of you also remember this retreat for was you not the associate of our flowery infancy  louisa and edward henry and emma formed the dear family groupe  you tell me it soothes you to indulge these sentiments but perhaps they may be too great a trial for the present state of your spirits and i forbear  sir robert raymond our host is a broad set brown faced good natured very sensible man with some not disagreeable particularities a large fortune some time since bequeathed him and no sort of impertinence in consequence of it humor serious sense and observation divide his character he was bred to physic and in the earlier part of his life practiced as a seasurgeon he is replete with anecdote and extremely assiduous to animate conversation without engrossing it i am particularly the object of his notice chiefly no doubt because he perceives i stand most in need of comfort and i return his civilities as well as the situation of my heart will allow  yet with respect to the country i was somewhat mistaken my friend i happen to be fixed in a spot where every leaf of every tree appears consecrated an holy inspiration seems to breathe about me  wherever i look i behold a trait of henry  i tread the paths where arm in arm we have walked together and i sleep in the very apartment which was formerly devoted to his repose these are small circumstances louisa but they cling close to the heart  yes my dearest friend this place is not without some softnesses some seducing sweets agreeable to the present distress which bears upon my spirits however depressed however exhausted i am in proper feeling to enjoy such a retreat the tender lapse of the streams the balmy lightness of the air the serene quietude of shade the freshness of that verdure which at once charms and cherishes the eye the carol of the gentler kind of birds the unobtrusive bloom of the softer kind of flowers  each and all of these conspire to produce that weeping resignation which louisa has described and which is the natural effect of a virtuous heart in disappointment  but still i am unhappy since i am not permitted to talk of the dear cause of my grief i feel more some part of the sorrow which used to vent itself in language is now doubled by solitude and silence like brooks which murmur least when they are most profound i write this in a little rocky cavity that stands in the garden where at your beloved hour of twilights soberest gray i have stepped forth amidst the fanning fragrance of eve to meditate and to mourn but while i write of my sequestration it is about to be disturbed for the tread of an intruder assails my ear  it is sir robert raymond  adieu oh louisa adieu  emma ps if i too much affect you check my pen    letter xlvi to emma corbett ah no my charming sister i will not quit the claim  i can bear it now  i wish to weep  to weep plenteously for i am happy  oh the proud word i had lately such prospects of horror before my eyes that to find them thus unexpectedly removed makes me able to look at the light of the sun with a smile and that though but of a moments continuance is happiness to a wretch like me  go on therefore go on  proceed to amuse to affect to touch me all hail the varied emotions which your pen inspires ah emma emma think what a bright beam of bliss must break on the bosom of her whose chief surviving treasure is rescued from the jaws of death think o think what a parent feels when wounded in every finer nerve and then healed again  alas what have i said how wild is transport into what flights does extacy carry the heart which is unused to a visitor so radiant oh emma edward is dead and yet existence is at this instant accounted precious to his and to your  louisa hammond  letter xlvii to louisa hammond a parent feels  i understand you not and yet such sentiments at such a time can surely spring from but one sacred source a parent feel o great god louisa how am i to interpret this  what am i to think i pause from my own feelings in sympathy of yours  yet what am i to think consider my suspense consider what you owe a faithful longtried friend consider i am your own  emma  letter xlviii to emma corbett you are emma you are my friend you are to me and i to you all which is comprised in the sweet description that both have a thousand times repeated  we emma like two artificial gods have with our needles created both one flower both on one sampler sitting on one cushion both warbling of one song both in one key as if our hands and sides voices and minds had been incorporate so we grew together like to a double cherry seeming parted two lovely berries molded on one stem so with two seeming bodies and one heart and shall i longer withhold from you the new claims  claims which yet you know not of  to love me  what shall you think o think of every thing that is most tender  think that i have a title to all your pity to all your affection  think that the sole pledge of honorable love is just snatched from the grave and think too that you behold the widow of the hapless edward in lousia   letter xlix to louisa hammond a wife a widow and the mother of an orphan  at least of a dear fatherless child married to my brother and this the first difclosure i am all amazement all terror and all tears o explain the mystery since you have begun suffer me to continue the same sweet language and to reproach you softly  is all the council that we two have shared the sister vows the hours that we have spent when we have chid the hasty footed time for parting us  oh and is all forgot no no you will tell me all and be indeed the sister of  emma  letter l to emma corbett i have gone too far to recede and you shall know all though i have broken a trust and my conscience smites me i am used to misery but the novelty of joy was too much to bear and has betrayed me to a very dear and gentle bosom i confess even to the sister of the man who had bound me in the bonds of honor and made secrecy a double duty yet i will go on without reserve so soon as a firmer state of health will permit  the exertion of my spirits is now succeeded by a worse languor than i have ever before experienced and i am reduced once more to the necessity of addressing you from my pillow suspend therefore your curiosity pity my weakness and pray for my recovery  but do not on any account come to me even should you hear no more from me for some time i know how to nurse my disorder and till all matters are explained i would not wish you again to see the sister of emma and the widow of edward o let my secret sleep in the innermost sanctuary of your bosom  farewell  louisa corbett  letter li to frederick berkley esquire be so obliging as to tell me whether it is madness or dotage to which i am now reduced that it is one or the other provided it be not a mixture of both is now past question i cannot suffer corbett to propose me to his daughter nor have i the confidence to propose myself and indeed the more frequently i converse with her which i take all decent occasions of doing the more i see her hear her voice and perceive the sense distinct and clear that is falling from her lips whenever she opens them the less am i able to speak nay the less assurance have i to believe that so much merit youth and beauty will have any thing to say seriously to a fellow with so sunburnt a form and unsentimental a set of features as the middleaged robert raymond  she has an affecting trick of shedding tears frederick and of sighing bitterly which burst upon one so unpreparedly that though i knew them to be the effusions of her friendship for the young volunteer i could not find it in my heart to check them but let a few of the same kind steal down my own cheek in very fellowship of sympathy i should upon my word i feel that i should and i have not sported with my emotions enough to disguise them  yet i have never heard her mention the name of hammond since her arrival at castleberry from whence you see i am how dating is not this strange i always thought the tongue was a traitor upon these occasions she looks hammond methinks but she speaks him not i think i can interpret her eyes but they are indeed the seat of every fine sentiment and seem made to express every thing that is gentle and tender so that it is no wonder you friend frederick are an adept in these matters inform me  little of this great world can i speak more than pertains to feats of salves and plasters and therefore little shall i grace my cause in judging for myself  i do really think i am engaged in a very unthrifty undertaking  a lookingglass that happens to hang near the table on which i am now writing confirms me in this opinion there is such a palpable air of confidence in supposing i should succeed that had not the torrid zone scorched all the graces cf the blood out of my countenance i should certainly blush  i write you see in my old way but i am put sorely out of my old road for all that it is after all a droll sort of defect i possess that of really thinking i am too old and ugly to be an object of a young womans attachment yet there is nothing very preposterous in this idea either speak to emma says passion dread a repulse replies common sense then give up the point and think no more about it cries prudence ah teach me how i should forget to think answers love in the language of romeo a pretty struggle this for a grave man of fortythree frederick is it not between ourselves i fancy that when i have procrastinated as much as possible played the fool with my feelings and made myself sufficiently miserable i shall 0see the propriety of escaping an explanation and so make a match of it in the temple of fancy only where a man chooses his own mistress and can dread no disappointment after all i cannot but apprehend there is some little delicacy in this conduct it proceeds from a quick terror of becoming ridiculous tender attachments and all the train of the sensations they produce are extremely graceful at five and twenty but when one has reached the wrong side of forty i do truly think the belle passion somewhat outre yet hitherto having mixed but little with amiable young women and never with immodest ones the ardours of eighteen can scarce exceed my own and i am in this first affection this first love for it is absolutely such as bashful and as awkward as a boy just ushered into the society of the sex it is passing strange and perhaps passing pitiful but however you may enjoy the confession i fully feel all the tremors of tenderness  robert raymond  letter lii to louisa corbett pray for your recovery oh how servently do i pour the petitionary prayer to the great restorer dear as is the name of hammond much as i love to write it and sweet as are the sensations which agitate my heart so often as i see it marked upon the paper there is methinks something more dear more lovely and more sweet in that of louisa corbett at least her title to use it seems to bring the sister so close upon my bosom and so soft upon my soul that i feel uncommon joy at the tidings a child too  a little edward  is it not so but i will restrain the torrent  i will forbear i will pray for your recovery and then  ah then will you not have perfect confidence in your sister  letter liii to frederick berkley esquire of bodily disorders i know the symptoms but cannot decide with equal skill or precision about those of the mind pray thou child of refinement tell me what are we to think of a young lady when she seeks occasion to converse with you when she chooses rather to chat and walk with a man of fortythree than with several younger and handsomer visitors who are now at my house and above all when she makes advances to pupillage and desires to become a scholar yes yes laugh away but assure yourself that i have hopes for emma has proposed by way of country amusement during her stay at my place to    faith frederick you are such a grinner that i am almost afraid to speak    during her stay as i said at castleberry to study the art of  surgery  now as this branch of knowledge can be of no real service to her i will let you know how i choose to interpret it  choose i say so dont you put me out of favor with the conceit nor the conceit out of favor with me  i choose therefore to consider it as a decent way of telling me my friendship ship is not disagreeable and this idea soothes me so once again i entreat you will not be such a raven as to crock the comfort from my bosom alas dear friend half the hopes of this little life are delusive but while they delude us into happiness let us not affect to despise them imagination is only a gayer name for matter of fact in many cases  think so and it is so if felicity be seated in the mind it must often depend upon the fair shadows of opinion and one may say without a paradox that these are frequently substantiol adieu  robert raymond  end of the first volume
