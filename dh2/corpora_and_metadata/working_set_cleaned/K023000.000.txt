portrait of alexander pope mr pope   mr popes literary correspondence for thirty years from   0  to      being a collection of letters which passed between him and several eminent persons  volume the first  london printed for e curll in rosestreet covent garden mdccxxxv  preface we presume we want no apology to the reader for this publication but some may be thought needful to mr pope however he cannot think our offense so great as theirs who first separately published what we have here but collected in a better form and order as for the letters we have procured to be added they serve but to complete explain and sometimes set in a true light those others which it was not in the writers or our power to recall  this collection has been owing to several cabinets some drawn from thence by accidents and others even of those to ladies voluntarily given it is to one of that sex we are beholden for the whole correspondence with h c esquire which letters being lent her by that gentleman she took the liberty to print as appears by the following which we shall give at length both as it is something curious and as it may serve for an apology for our selves  to henry cromwell esquire june         after so long a silence as the many and great oppressions i have sighed under has occasioned one is at a loss how to begin a letter to so kind a friend as your self but as it was always my resolution if i must sink to do it as decently that is as silently as i could so when i found my self plunged into unforeseen and unavoidable ruin i retreated from the world and in a manner buried my self in a dismal place where i knew none nor none knew me in this dull unthinking way i have protracted a lingering death for life it cannot be calld ever since you saw me sequestered from company deprived of my books and nothing left to converse with but the letters of my dead or absent friends amongst which latter i always placed yours and mr popes in the first rank i lent some of them indeed to an ingenious person who was so delighted with the specimen that he importuned me for a sight of the rest which having obtained he conveyed them to the press i must not say altogether with my consent nor wholly without it i thought them too good to be lost in oblivion and had no cause to apprehend the disobliging of any the public viz all persons of taste and judgment would be pleased with so agreeable an amusement mr cromwell could not be angry since it was but justice to his merit to publish the solemn and private professions of love gratitude and veneration made him by so celebrated an author and surely mr pope ought not to resent the publication since the early pregnancy of his genius was no dishonor to his character and yet had either of you been asked common modesty would have obliged you to refuse what you would not be displeased with if done without your knowledge and besides to end all dispute you had been pleased to make me a free gift of them to do what i pleased with them and every one knows that the person to whom a letter is addressed has the same right to dispose of it as he has of goods purchased with his money i doubt not but your generosity and honor will do me the right of owning by a line that i came honestly by them i flatter my self in a few months i shall again be visible to the world and whenever through good providence that turn shall happen i shall joyfully acquaint you with it there being none more truly your obliged servant than sir  your faithful and most humble servant e thomas p s a letter sir directed to mrs thomas to be left at my house will be safely transmitted to her by  yours etc e curll     to mr pope epsom july        when these letters were first printed i wondred how curll could come by em and could not but laugh at the pompous title since whatever you wrote to me was humor and familiar raillery as soon as i came from epsom i heard you had been to see me and i writ you a short letter from wills that i longed to see you mr ds about that time charged me with giving em to a mistress which i positively denied not in the least at that time thinking of it but some time after finding in the newspapers letters from lady packington lady chudleigh and mr norris to the same sapho or e t i began to fear that i was guilty i have never seen these letters of curlls nor would go to his shop about them i have not seen this sapho alias e t these seven years  her writing that i gave her em to do what she would with em is straining the point too far i thought not of it nor do i think she did then but severe necessity which catches hold of a twig has produced all this which has lain hid and forgot by me so many years curll sent me a letter last week desiring a positive answer about this matter but finding i would give him none he went to e t and writ a postscript in her long romantic letter to direct my answer to his house but they not expecting an answer sent a young man to me whose name it seems is pattisson i told him i should not write any thing but i believed it might be so as she writ in her letter i am extremely concerned that my former indiscretion in putting em into the hands of this pretieuse should have given you so much disturbance for the last thing i should do would be to disoblige you for whom i have ever preserved the greatest esteem and shall ever be sir  your faithful friend and most humble servant henry cromwell   to mr pope august        though i writ my long narrative from epsom till i was tired yet was i not satisfied lest any doubt should rest upon your mind i could not make protestations of my innocence of a grievous crime but i was impatient till i came to town that i might send you those letters as a clear evidence that i was a perfect stranger to all their proceeding should i have protested against it after the printing it might have been taken for an attempt to decry his purchase and as the little exception you have taken has served him to play his game upon us for these two years a new incident from me might enable him to play it on for two more  the great value she expresses for all you write and her passion for having em i believe was what prevailed upon me to let her keep em by the interval of twelve years at least from her possession to the time of printing em it is manifest that i had not the least ground to apprehend such a design but as people in great straits bring forth their hoards of old gold and most valued jewels so sapho had recourse to her hid treasure of letters and played off not only yours to me but all those to herself as the ladys laststake into the press  as for me i hope when you shall cooly consider the many thousand instances of our being deluded by the females since that great original of adam by eve you will have a more favorable thought of the undesigning error of  your faithful friend and humble servant henry cromwell   now should our apology for this publication be as ill received as the ladys seems to have been by the gentlemen concerned we shall at least have her comfort of being thanked by the rest of the world nor has mr p himself any great cause to think it much offense to his modesty or reflection on his judgment when we take care to inform the public that there are few letters of his in this collection which were not written under twenty years of age on the other hand we doubt not the reader will be much more surpised to find at that early period so much variety of style affecting sentiment and justness of criticism in pieces which must have been writ in haste very few perhaps ever reviewd and none intended for the eye of the public  letters of sir william trumbull mr steel mr addison and mr pope from      to      portrait of joseph addison mr addison   secretary of state to king william the third sir william trumbull to mr pope i have this moment received the favor of yours of the  th instant and will make you a true excuse though perhaps no very good one that i deferred the troubling you with a letter when i sent back your papers in hopes of seeing you at binfield before this time if i had met with any fault in your performance i should freely now as i have done too presumptuously in conversation with you tell you my opinion which i have frequently ventured to give you rather in compliance with your desires than that i could think it reasonable for i am not yet satisfied upon what grounds i can pretend to judge of poetry who never have been practiced in the art there may possibly be some happy geniuss who may judge of some of the natural beauties of a poem as a man may of the proportions of a building without having read vitruvius or knowing any thing of the rules of architecture but this though it may sometimes be in the right must be subject to many mistakes and is certainly but a superficial knowledge without entering into the art the methods and the particular excellencies of the whole composure in all the parts of it  besides my want of skill i have another reason why i ought to suspect my self by reason of the great affection i have for you which might give too much biass to be kind to every thing that comes from you but after all i must say and i do it with an oldfashioned sincerity that i entirely approve of your translation of those pieces of homer both as to the versification and the true sense that shines through the whole nay i am confirmed in my former application to you and give me leave to renew it upon this occasion that you would proceed in translating that incomparable poet to make him speak good english to dress his admirable characters in your proper significant and expressive conceptions and to make his works as useful and instructive to this degenerate age as he was to our friend horace when he read him at praeneste qui quid sit pulchrum quid turpe quid utile quid non etc i break off with that quid non with which i confess i am charmed  upon the whole matter i entreat you to send this presently to be added to the miscellanies and i hope it will come time enough for that purpose  i have nothing to say of my nephew bs observations for he sent them to me so late that i had not time to consider them i dare say he endeavored very faithfully though he told me very hastily to execute your commands  all i can add is that if your excess of modesty should hinder you from publishing this essay i shall only be sorry that i have no more credit with you to persuade you to oblige the public and very particularly dear sir  your most faithful humble servant w trumbull april     0  mr pope to the hon j c esquire june         i send you denniss remarks on the on criticism essay which equally abound in just criticisms and fine railleries the few observations in my hand in the margins are what a mornings leisure permitted me to make purely for your perusal for i am of opinion that such a critic as you will find him by the latter part of his book is but one way to be properly answered and that way i would not take after what he informs me in his preface that he is at this time persecuted by fortune this i knew not before if i had his name had been spared in the essay for that only reason i cannot conceive what ground he has for so excessive a resentment nor imagine how those but appius reddens at each word you speak and stares tremendous with a threatening eye like some fierce tyrant in old tapestry  three lines can be called a reflection on his person which only describe him subject a little to anger on some occasions i have heard of combatants so very furious as to fall down themselves with that very blow which they designed to lay heavy on their antagonists but if mr denniss rage proceeds only from a zeal to discourage young and unexperienced writers from scribbling he should frighten us with his verse not prose for i have often known that when all the precepts in the world would not reclaim a sinner some very sad example has done the business this thought we find afterward put into verse in the dunciad book   yet to give this man his due he has objected to one or two lines with reason and i will alter em in case of another edition i will make my enemy do me a kindness where he meant an injury and so serve instead of a friend what he observes at the bottom of page  0th of his reflections was objected to by yourself and had been mended but for the haste of the press it is right hibernian and i confess it what the english call a bull in the expression though the sense be manifest enough mr denniss bulls are seldom in the expression they are always in the sense  i shall certainly never make the least reply to him not only because you advise me but because i have ever been of opinion that if a book cannot answer for itself to the public it is to no sort of purpose for its author to do it if i am wrong in any sentiment of that essay i protest sincerely i dont desire all the world should be deceived which would be of very ill consequence merely that i my self may be thought right which is of very little consequence i would be the first to recant for the benefit of others and the glory of my self for as i take it when a man owns himself to have been in an error he does but tell you in other words that he is wiser than he was but i have had an advantage by the publishing that book of dss which otherwise i should never have known it has been the occasion of making me friends and open abetters of several gentlemen of known sense and wit and of proving to me what i have till now doubted that my writings are taken some notice of by the world in general or i should never be attacked thus in particular i have read that twas a custom among the romans while a general rode in triumph to have common soldiers in the streets that railed at him and reproached him to put him in mind that though his services were in the main approved and rewarded yet he had faults enough to keep him humble  you will see by this that whoever sets up for wit in these days ought to have the constancy of a primitive christian and be prepared to suffer martyrdom in the cause of it but sure this is the first time that a wit was attacked for his religion as you will find i am most zealously in this treatise and you know sir what alarms i have had from the sea the ensuing letters opposite side on this account have i not reason to cry out with the poor fellow in virgil quid jam misero mihi denique restat cui neque apud danaos usquam locus and super ipsi dardanidae infensi paenas cum sanguine poscunt   it is however my happiness that you sir are impartial jove was alike to latian and to phrygian for you well know that wits of no religion   the manner in which mr d takes to pieces several particular lines detached from their natural places may show how easy it is to a caviller to give a new sense or a new nonsense to any thing and indeed his constructions are not more wrested from the genuine meaning than theirs who objected to the heterodox parts as they called em  our friend the abbe is not of that sort who with the utmost candor and freedom has modestly told me what others thought and shown himself one as he very well expresses it rather of a number than a party the only difference between us in relation to the monks is that he thinks most sorts of learning flourished among em and i am of opinion that only some sort of learning was barely kept alive by em he believes that in the most natural and obvious sense that line  a second deluge learning overrun will be understood of learning in general and i fancy twill be understood only as it is meant of polite learning criticism poetry etc which is the only learning concerned in the subject of the essay it is true that the monks did preserve what learning there was about nicholas the fifths time but those who succeeded fell into the depth of barbarism or at least stood at a stay while others rose from thence insomuch that even erasmus and reuchlin could hardly laugh them out of it i am highly obliged to the abbes zeal in my commendation and goodness in not concealing what he thinks my error and his testifying some esteem for the book just at a time when his brethren raised a clamor against it is an instance of great generosity and candor which i shall ever acknowledge  your etc  to the same june         in your last you informed me of the mistaken zeal of some people who seem to make it no less their business to persuade men they are erroneous than doctors do that they are sick only that they may magnify their own cure and triumph over an imaginary distemper the simile objected to in my essay thus wit like faith by each man is applied to one small sect and all are damned beside plainly concludes at this second line where stands a full stop and what follows  meanly they seek etc speaks only of wit which is meant by that blessing and that sun for how can the sun of faith be said to sublime the southern wits and to ripen the geniuss of northern climates i fear these gentlemen understand grammar as little as they do criticism and perhaps out of good nature to the monks are willing to take from em the censure of ignorance and to have it to themselves the word they refers as i am sure i meant and as i thought every one must have known to those critics there spoken of who are partial to some particular set of writers to the prejudice of all others and the very simile it self if twice read may convince them that the censure here of damning lies not on our church at all unless they call our church one small sect and the cautious words  by each man manifestly show it a general reflection on all such whoever they are who entertain those narrow and limited notions of the mercy of the almighty which the reformed ministers and presbyterians are as guilty of as any people living  yet after all i promise you sir if the alteration of a word or two will gratify any man of sound faith though weak understanding i will though it were from no other principle than that of common good nature comply with it and if you please but to particularize the spot where their objection lies for it is in a very narrow compass that stumbling block though it be but a little pebble shall be removed out of their way if the heat of these good disputants who i am afraid being bred up to wrangle in the schools cannot get rid of the humor all their lives should proceed so far as to personal reflections upon me i assure you notwithstanding i will do or say nothing however provoked for some people can no more provoke than oblige that is unbecoming the character of a true catholic i will set before me the example of that great man and great saint erasmus who in the midst of calumny proceeded with all the calmness of innocence and the unrevenging spirit of primitive christianity however i would advise them to suffer the mention of him to pass unregarded lest i should be forced to do that for his reputation which i would never do for my own i mean to vindicate so great a light of our church from the malice of past times and the ignorance of the present in a language which may extend farther than that in which the trifle about criticism is written i wish these gentlemen would be contented with finding fault with me only who will submit to em right or wrong as far as i only am concerned i have a greater regard to the quiet of mankind than to disturb it for things of so little consequence as my credit and my sense a little humility can do a poet no hurt and a little charity would do a priest none for as st austin finely says ubi charitas ibi humilitas ubi humilitas ibi pax  yours etc  to the same july         the concern which you more than seem to be affected with for my reputation by the several accounts you have so obligingly given of what reports and censures the holy vandals have thought fit to pass upon me makes me desirous of telling so good a friend my whole thoughts of this matter and of letting before you in a clear light the true state of it  i have ever believed the best piece of service one could do to our religion was openly to express our detestation and scorn of all those mean artifices and piae frauds which it stands so little in need of and which have laid it under so great a scandal among its enemies  nothing has been so much a scarecrow to them as that too peremptory and seeminglyuncharitable assertion of an utter impossibility of salvation to all but ourselves invincible ignorance excepted which indeed some people define under so great limitations and with such exclusions that it seems as if that word were rather invented as a salvo or expedient not to be thought too bold with the thunderbolts of god which are hurled about so freely on almost all mankind by the hands of ecclesiastics than as a real exception to almostuniversal damnation for besides the small number of the truly faithful in our church we must again subdivide the jansenist is damned by the jesuit the jesuit by the jansenist the scotist by the thomist and so forth  there may be errors i grant but i cannot think em of such consequence as to destroy utterly the charity of mankind the very greatest bond in which we are engaged by god to one another therefore i own to you i was glad of any opportunity to express my dislike of so shocking a sentiment as those of the religion i profess are commonly charged with and i hoped a slight insinuation introduced so easily by a casual similitude only could never have given offense but on the contrary must needs have done good in a nation and time where we are the smaller party and consequently most misrepresented and most in need of vindication  for the same reason i took occasion to mention the superstition of some ages after the subversion of the roman empire which is too manifest a truth to be denied and does in no sort reflect upon the present professors of our faith who are free from it our silence in these points may with some reason make our adversaries think we allow and persist in those bigottries which yet in reality all good and sensible men despise though they are persuaded not to speak against em i cannot tell why since now it is no way the interest even of the worst of our priesthood as it might have been then to have them smothered in silence for as the opposite sects are now prevailing it is too late to hinder our church from being slandered it is our business now to show it is slandered unjustly and to vindicate ourselves from being thought abettors of what they charge us with this cannot so well be brought about with serious faces we must laugh with them at what deserves it and then we need not doubt of being cleared even in their opinions  as to particulars you cannot but have observed that at first the whole objection against the simile of wit and faith lay to the word they when that was beyond contradiction removed the very grammar serving to confute em then the objection lies against the simile itself or if that simile will not be objected to sense and common reason being indeed a little stubborn and not apt to give way to every body next the mention of superstition must become a crime as if religion and she were sisters or that it were a scandal upon the family of christ to say a word against the devils bastard afterward more mischief is discovered in a place that seemed innocent at first the two lines about schismatics at the bottom of page    an ordinary man would imagine the author plainly declared against those schismatics for quitting the true faith out of contempt of the understanding of some few of its believers but these believers are called dull and because i say that those schismatics think some believers dull therefore these charitable interpreters of my meaning will have it that i think all believers dull i was telling lately mr  these objections who assured me i had said nothing which a catholic need to disown and i have cause to know that gentlemans fault if he has any is not want of zeal he put a notion into my head which i confess i cannot but perfectly acquiesce in that when a set of people are piqud at any truth which they think to their own disadvantage their method of revenge on the truthspeaker is to attack his reputation a byway and not openly to object to the place they are really galled by what these therefore in his opinion are in earnest angry at is that erasmus whom their tribe oppressed and persecuted should be vindicated after an age of obloquy by one of their own people willing to utter an honest truth in behalf of the dead whom no man sure will flatter and to whom few will do justice others you know were as angry that i mentioned mr walsh with honor who as he never refused to any one of merit of any party the praise due to him so honestly deserved it from all others though of ever so different interests or sentiments may i be ever guilty of this sort of liberty and latitude of principle which gives us the hardiness of speaking well of those whom envy oppresses even after death as i would always speak well of my living friends when they are absent nay because they are absent so would i much more of the dead in that eternal absence and the rather because i expect no thanks for it  thus sir you see i do in my conscience persist in what i have written yet in my friendship i will recant and alter whatever you please in case of a second edition which i think the book will not so soon arrive at for tonsonss printer told me he drew off a thousand copies in this first impression and i fancy a treatise of this nature which not one gentleman in threescore even of a liberal education can understand can hardly exceed the vent of that number you shall find me a true trojan in my faith and friendship in both which i will presevere to the end  your etc  to general upon his having translated into french verse the essay on criticism if i could as well express or if you will allow me to say it translate the sentiments of my heart as you have done those of my head in your excellent version of my essay i should not only appear the best writer in the world but what i much more desire to be thought the most your servant of any man living it is an advantage very rarely known to receive at once a great honor and a great improvement this sir you have afforded me having at the same time made others take my sense and taught me to understand my own if i may call that my own which is indeed more properly yours your verses are no more a translation of mine than virgils are of homer but are like his the justest imitation and the noblest commentary  in putting me into a french dress you have not only adorned my outside but mended my shape and if i am now a good figure i must consider you have naturalized me into a country which is famous for making every man a fine gentleman it is by your means that contrary to most young travelers i am come back much better than i went out  i cannot but wish we had a bill of commerce for translation established the next parliament we could not fail of being gainers by that nor of making our selves amends for all we have lost by the war nay though we should insist upon the demolishing of boileaus works the french as long as they have writers of your form might have as good an equivalent  upon the whole i am really as proud as our ministers can be of the terms i have gained from abroad and i design like them to publish speedily to the world the benefits accruing from them for i cannot resist the temptation of printing your admirable translation here this was never done for the two printed french versions are neither of this hand the one was the work of monsieur roboton private ecretary to king george the first printed in  o at amsterdam and at london      the other by the abbe resnel in  o with a large preface and notes at paris    0  to which if you will be so obliging to give me leave to prefix your name it will be the only addition you can make to the honor already done me i am  your etc  the hon j c to mr pope may         i am very glad for the sake of the widow and for the credit of the deceased that a translation of some part of chaucers canterbury tales the prologues etc printed in a miscellany with some works of mr pope in   vol   o by b lintot bettertons remains are fallen into such hands as may render em reputable to the one and beneficial to the other besides the public acquaintance i long had with that poor man i also had a slender knowledge of his parts and capacity by private conversation and ever thought it pity he was necessitated by the straitness of his fortune to act and especially to his latest hours an imaginary and fictitious part who was capable of exhibiting a real one with credit to himself and advantage to his neighbor  i hope your health permitted you to execute your design of giving us an imitation of pollio i am satisfied twill be doubly divine and i shall long to see it i ever thought churchmusick the most ravishing of all harmonious compositions and must also believe sacred subjects well handled the most inspiring of all poetry  but where hangs the lock now though i know that rather than draw any just reflection upon your self of the least shadow of ill nature you would freely have suppressed one of the best of poems i hear no more of it  will it comee out in lintots miscellany or not i wrote to lord petre upon the subject of the lock some time since but have as yet had no answer nor indeed do i know when he will be in london i have since i saw you corresponded with mrs w i hope she is now with her aunt and that her journey thither was something facilitated by my writing to that lady as pressingly as possible not to let any thing whatsoever obstruct it i sent her obliging answer to the party it most concerned and when i hear mrs w is certainly there i will write again to my lady to urge as much as possible the effecting the only thing that in my opinion can make her niece easy i have run out my extent of paper and am  your etc  mr popes answer may         it is not only the disposition i always have of conversing with you that makes me so speedily answer your obliging letter but the apprehension lest your charitable intent of writing to my lady a on mrs ws affair should be frustrated by the short stay she makes there she went thither on the   th with that mixture of expectation and anxiety with which people usually go into unknown or halfdiscoverd countries utterly ignorant of the dispositions of the inhabitants and the treatment they are to meet with the unfortunate of all people are the most unfit to be left alone yet we see the world generally takes care they shall be so whereas if we took a considerate prospect of human nature the business and study of the happy and easy should be to divert and humor as well as comfort and pity the distressed i cannot therefore excuse some near allies of mine for their conduct of late toward this lady which has given me a great deal of anger as well as sorrow all i shall say to you of em at present is that they have not been my relations these two months the consent of opinions in our minds is certainly a nearer tie than can be contracted by all the blood in our bodies and i am proud of finding i have something congenial with you will you permit me to confess to you that all the favors and kind offices you have shown toward me have not so strongly cemented me yours as the discovery of that generous and manly compassion you manifested in the case of this unhappy lady i am afraid to insinuate to you how much i esteem you flatterers have taken up the style which was once peculiar to friends and an honest man has now no way left to express himself besides the common one of knaves so that true friends nowadays differ in their address from flatterers much as right mastiffs do from spniels and show themselves by a dumb surly sort of fidelity rather than by their complaisant and open kindness  will you never leave commending my poetry in fair truth sir i like it but too well myself already  expose me no more i beg you to the great danger of vanity the rock of all men but most of young men and be kindly content for the future when you would please me thoroughly to say only you like what i write  your etc  mr steel to mr pope june        i am at a solitude an house between hampstead and london wherein sir charles sedley died this circumstance set me a thinking and ruminating upon the employments in which men of wit exercise themselves it was said of sir charles who breathed his last in this room sedley has that prevailing gentle art which can with a resistless charm impart the loosest wishes to the chastest heart raise such a conflict kindle such a fire between declining virtue and desire till the poor vanquished maid dissolves away in dreams all night in sighs and tears all day this was an happy talent to a man of the town but i dare say without presuming to make uncharitable conjectures on the authors present condition he would rather have had it said of him that he had prayed  oh thou my voice inspire who touched isaiahs ballowd lips with fire   i have turned to every verse and chapter and think you have preserved the sublime heavenly spirit throughout the whole especially at  hark a glad voice  and  the lamb with wolves shall graze  there is but one line which i think below the original he wipes the tears for ever from our eyes   you have expressed it with a good and pious but not with so exalted and poetical a spirit as the prophet the lord god will wipe away tears from off all faces if you agree with me in this alter it by way of paraphrase or otherwise that when it comes into a volume it may be amended your poem is already better than the pollio i am  your etc  mr pope to mr steel june         you have obliged me with a very kind letter by which i find you shift the seen of your life from the town to the country and enjoy that mixed state which wise men both delight in and are qualified for methinks the moralists and philosophers have generally run too much into extremes in commending entirely either solitude or public life in the former men for the most part grow useless by too much rest and in the latter are destroyed by too much precipitation as waters lying still putrify and are good for nothing and running violently on do but the more mischief in their passage to others and are swallowed up and lost the sooner themselves those indeed who can be useful to all states should be like gentle streams that not only glide through lonely valleys and forests amidst the flocks and the shepherds but visit populous towns in their course and are at once of ornament and service to them but there are another sort of people who seem designed for solitude such i mean as have more to hide than to show as for my own part i am one of those of whom seneca says tam umbratiles sunt ut putent in turbido esse quicquid in luce est some men like some pictures are fitter for a corner than a full light and i believe such as have a natural bent to solitude to carry on the former similitude are like waters which may be forced into fountains and exalted into a great height may make a noble figure and a louder noise but after all they would run more smoothly quietly and plentifully in their own natural course upon the ground the consideration of this would these foregoing similitudes our author had put into verse some years before and inserted into mr wycherleyss poem on mixed life we find him apparently in the versification of them as they are since printed in wycherleys eosthumous works  o page   d and   th make me very well contented with the possession only of that quiet which cowley calls the companion of obscurity but whoever has the muses too for his companions can never be idle enough to be uneasy thus sir you see i would flatter myself into a good opinion of my own way of living plutarch just now told me that it is in human life as in a game at tables where a man may wish for the highest cast but if his chance be otherwise he is even to play it as well as he can and to make the best of it i am  your etc  mr pope to mr steel june         you formerly observed to me that nothing made a more ridiculous figure in a mans life than the disparity we often find in him sick and well thus one of an unfortunate constitution is perpetually exhibiting a miserable example of the weakness of his mind and of his body in their turns i have had frequent opportunities of late to consider myself in these different views and i hope have received some advantage by it if what mr waller says be true that the souls dark cottage battered and decayed lets in new light through chinks that time has made   then surely sickness contributing no less than old age to the shaking down this scaffolding of the body may discover the inward structure more plainly sickness is a sort of early old age it teaches us a diffidence in our earthly state and inspires us with the thoughts of a future better than a thousand volumes of philosophers and divines it gives so warning a concussion to those props of our vanity our strength and youth that we think of fortifying ourselves within when there is so little dependence upon our outworks youth at the very best is but a betrayer of human life in a gentler and smoother manner than age it is like a stream that nourishes a plant upon a bank and causes it to flourish and blossom to the sight but at the same time is undermining it at the root in secret my youth has dealt more fairly and openly with me it has afforded several prospects of my danger and given me an advantage not very common to young men that the attractions of the world have nor dazzled me very much and i begin where most people end with a full conviction of the emptiness of all sorts of ambition and the unsatisfactory nature of all human pleasures when a smart fit of sickness tells me this scurvy tenement of my body will fall in a little time i am even as unconcerned as was that honest hibernian who being in bed in the great storm some years ago and told the house would tumble over his head made answer what care i for the house i am only a lodger i fancy it is the best time to die when one is in the best humor and so excessively weak as i now am i may say with conscience that i am not at all uneasy at the thought that many men whom i never had any esteem for are likely to enjoy this world after me when i reflect what an inconsiderable little atome every single man is with respect to the whole creation methinks it is a shame to be concerned at the removal of such a trivial animal as i am the morning after my exit the sun will rise as bright as ever the flowers smell as sweet the plants spring as green the world will proceed in its old course people will laugh as heartily and marry as fast as they were used to do the memory of man as it is elegantly expressed in the wisdom of solomon passes away as the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth but one day there are reasons enough in the fourth chapter of the same book to make any young man contented with the prospect of death for honorable age is not that which stands in length of time or is measured by number of years but wisdom is the gray hair to men and an unspotted life is old age he was taken away speedily lest wickedness should alter his understanding or deceit beguile his soul etc i am  your etc  mr pope to mr steel nov        i was the other day in company with five or six men of some learning where chancing to mention the famous verses which the emperor adrian spoke on his deathbed they were all agreed that twas a piece of gaiety unworthy of that prince in those circumstances i could not but differ from this opinion methinks it was by no means a gay but a very serious soliloquy to his soul at the point of his departure in which sense i naturally took the verses at my first reading them when i was very young and before i knew what interpretation the world generally put upon them  animula vagula blandula hospes comesque corporis quae nune abibis in loca pallidula rigida nudula nec ut soles dabis joca alas my soul thou pleasing companion of this body thou fleeting thing that art now deserting it whither art thou flying to what unknown scene all trembling fearful and pensive now what is become of thy former wit and humor thou shall jest and be gay no more  i confess i cannot apprehend where lies the trifling in all this it is the most natural and obvious reflection imaginable to a dying man and if we consider the emperor was a heathen that doubt concerning the future fate of his soul will seem so far from being the effect of want of thought that twas scarce reasonable he should think otherwise not to mention that here is a plain confession included of his belief in its immortality the diminutive epithets of vagula blandula and the rest appear not to me as expressions of levity but rather of endearment and concern such as we find in catullus and the authors of hendecasyllabi after him where they are used to express the utmost love and tenderness for their mistresses  if you think me right in my notion of the last words of adrian be pleased to insert it in the spectator if not to suppress it i am  your etc adriani morientis ad animam translated ah fleeting spirit wandering fire that long have warmed my tender breast must thou no more this frame inspire no more a pleasing cheerful guest whither ah whither art thou flying to what dark undiscovered shore thou seem all trembling shivering dying and wit and humor are no more   mr steel to mr pope nov         i have read over your temple of fame twice and cannot find any thing amiss of weight enough to call a fault but see in it a thousand thousand beauties mr addison shall see it to morrow after his perusal of it i will let you know his thoughts i desire you would let me know whether you are at leisure or not i have a design which i shall open a month or two hence with the assistance of the few like yourself if your thoughts are unengaged i shall explain myself further i am  your etc  mr pope to mr steel nov         you oblige me by the indulgence you have shown the poem i sent you but will oblige me much more by the kind severity i hope for from you no errors are so trivial but they deserve to be mended but since you say you see nothing that may be called a fault can you but think it so that i have confined the attendance of this is not now to be found in the temple of fame of which poem he speaks here guardian spirits to heavens favorites only i could point you to several but it is my business to be informed of those faults i do not know and as for those i do not to talk of em but to correct em you speak of that poem in a style i neither merit nor expect but i assure you if you freely mark or dash out i shall look upon your blots to be its greatest beauties i mean if mr addison and yourself should like it in the whole otherwise the trouble of correction is what i would not take for i was really so diffident of it as to let it lie by me these hence it appears this poem was wait before the author was    years old two years just as you now see it i am afraid of nothing so much as to impose any thing on the world which is unworthy of its acceptance  as to the last period of your letter i shall be very ready and glad to contribute to any design that tends to the advantage of mankind which i am sure all yours do i wish i had but as much capacity as leisure for i am perfectly idle a sign i have not much capacity  if you will entertain the best opinion of me be pleased to think me your friend assure mr addison of my most faithful service of every ones esteem he must be assured already i am  your etc  mr pope to mr steel nov         i am sorry you published that notion about adrians verses as mine shad i imagined you would use my name i should have expressed my sentiments with more modesty and diffidence i only sent it to have your opinion and not to publish my own which i distrusted but i think the supposition you draw from the notion of adrians being addicted to magic is a little uncharitable that he might fear no sort of deity good or bad since in the third verse he plainly testifies his apprehension of a future state by being sollicitous whither his soul was going as to what you mention of his using gay and ludicrous expressions i have owned my opinion to be that the expressions are not so but that diminutives are often in the latin tongue used as marks of tenderness and concern  anima is no more than my soul animula has the force of my dear soul to say virgo bella is not half so endearing as virguncula bellula and had augustus only called horace lepidum hominem it had amounted to no more than that he thought him a pleasant fellow twas the homunciolum that expressed the love and tenderness that great emperor had for him and perhaps i should myself be much better pleased if i were told you called me your little friend than if you complimented me with the title of a great genius or an eminent hand as jacob does all his authors i am  your etc  mr pope to december        you have at length complied with the request i have often made you for you have shown me i must confess several of my faults in the sight of those letters upon a review of them i find many things that would give me shame if i were not more desirous to be thought honest than prudent so many things freely thrown out such lengths of unreservd friendship thoughts just warm from the brain without any polishing or dress the very dishabille of the understanding you have proved yourself more tender of anothers embryos than the fondest mothers are of their own for you have preserved every thing that i miscarried of since i know this i shall in one respect be more afraid of writing to you than ever at this careless rate because i see my evil works may again rise in judgment against me yet in another respect i shall be less afraid since this has given me such a proof of the extreme indulgence you afford to my slightest thoughts the revisal of these letters has been a kind of examination of conscience to me so fairly and faithfully have i set down in em from time to time the true and undistinguished state of my mind but i find that these which were intended as sketches of my friendship give as imperfect images of it as the little landscapes we commonly see in black and white do of a beautiful country they can represent but a very small part of it and that deprived of the life and luster of nature i perceive that the more i endeavored to render manifest the real affection and value i ever had for you i did but injure it by representing less and less of it as glasses which are designed to make an object very clear generally contract it yet as when people have a full idea of a thing first upon their own knowledge the least traces of it serve to refresh the remembrance and are not displeasing on that score so i hope the foreknowledge you had of my esteem for you is the reason that you do not dislike my letters  they will not be of any great service i find in the design i mentioned to you i believe i had better steal from a richer man and plunder your letters which i have kept as carefully as i would letters patents since they entitle me to what i more value than titles of honor you have some cause to apprehend this usage from me if what some say be true that i am a great borrower however i have hitherto had the luck that none of my creditors have challenged me for it and those who say it are such whose writings no man ever borrowed from so have the least reason to complain their works are granted on all hands to be but too much their own  another has been pleased to declare that my verses are corrected by other men i verily believe theirs were never corrected by any man but indeed if mine have not twas not my fault i have endeavored my utmost that they should but these things are only whispherd and i will not encroach upon bayss province and pen whispers so hasten to conclude  your etc  sir william trumbull to mr pope march        i think a hasty scribble shows more what flows from the heart than a letter after balzacs manner in studied phrases therefore i will tell you as fast as i can that i have received your favor of the   th past with your kind present of the rape of the lock you have given me the truest satisfaction imaginable not only in making good the just opinion i have ever had of your reach of thought and my idea of your comprehensive genius but likewise in that pleasure i take as an engglish man to see the french even boileau himself in his lutrin outdone in your poem for you descend leviore plectro to all the nicer touches that your own observation and wit furnish on such a subject as requires the finest strokes and the liveliest imagination but i must say no more though i could a great deal on what pleases me so much and henceforth i hope you will never condemn me of partiality since i only swim with the stream and approve what all men of good taste notwithstanding the jarring of parties must and do universally applaud i now come to what is of vast moment i mean the preservation of your health and beg of you earnestly to get out of all taverncompany and fly away tanquam ex incendio what a misery it is for you to be destroyed by the foolish kindness it is all one whether real or pretended of those who are able to bear the poison of bad wine and to engage you in so unequal a combat as to homer by all i can learn your business is done therefore come away and take a little time to breathe in the country i beg now for my own sake but much more for yours methinks mr  has said to you more than once heu fuge nate dea teque his ait eripe flammis   i am your etc  mr pope to sir william trumbull march         though any thing you write is sure to be a pleasure to me yet i must own your last letter made me uneasy you really use a style of compliment which i expect as little as i deserve it i know it is a common opinion that a young scribler is as ill pleased to hear truth of a young lady from the moment one sets up for an author one must be treated as ceremoniously that it is as unfaithfully as a kings favorite or as a king this proceeding joined to that natural vanity which first makes a man an author is certainly enough to render him a coxcomb for life but i must grant it is but a just judgment upon poets that they whose chief pretense is wit should be treated just as they themselves treat fools that is be cajoled with praises and i believe poets are the only poor fellows in the world whom any body will flatter  i would not be thought to say this as if the obliging letter you sent me deserved this imputation only it put me in mind of it and i fancy one may apply to ones friend what caesar said of his wife it was not sufficient that he knew her to be chaste himself but she should not be so much as suspected by others  as to the wonderful discoveries and all the good news you are pleased to tell me of myself i treat it as you who are in the secret treat common news groundless reports of things at a distance which i who look into the true springs of the affair at home in my own breast know to have no foundation at all for fame though it be as milton finely calls it the last infirmity of noble minds is scarce so strong a temptation as to warrant our loss of time here it can never make us lie down contentedly on a deathbed as some of the ancients are said to have done with that thought you sir have yourself taught me that an easy situation at that hour can proceed from no ambition less noble than that of an eternal felicity which is unattainable by the strongest endeavors of the wit but may be gained by the sincere intentions of the heart only as in the next world so in this the only solid blessings are owing to the goodness of the mind not the extent of the capacity friendship here is an emanation from the same source as beatitude there the same benevolence and grateful disposition that qualifies us for the one if extended farther makes us partakers of the other the utmost point of my desires in my present state terminates in the society and good will of worthy men which i look upon as no ill earnest and foretaste of the society and alliance of happy souls hereafter  the continuance of your favors to me is what not only makes me happy but causes me to set some value upon myself as a part of your care the instances i daily meet with of these agreeable awakenings of friendship are of too pleasing a nature not to be acknowledged whenever i think of you i am  your etc  to the same april  0      i have been almost every day employed in following your advice and amusing myself in painting in which i am most particularly obliged to mr jervas who gives me daily instructions and examples as to poetical affairs i am content at present to be a bare lookeron and from a practitioner turn an admirer which is as the world goes not very usual cato was not so much the wonder of rome in his days as he is of britain in ours and though all the foolish industry possible has been used to make it thought a partyplay yet what the author once said of another may the most properly in the world be applied to him on this occasion envy itself is dumb in wonder lost and factions strive who shall applaud him most   the numerous and violent claps of the whigparty on the one side of the theater were echoed back by the tories on the other while the author sweated behind the scenes with concern to find their applause proceeding more from the hand than the head this was the case too of the prologuewriter who was clapped into a stanch whig at almost every two lines i believe you have heard that after all the applauses of the opposite faction my lord bolingbroke sent for booth who played cato into the box between one of the acts and presented him with fifty guineas in acknowledgment as he expressed it for defending the cause of liberty so well against a perpetual dictator the whigs are unwilling to be distancd this way as it is said and therefore design a present to the same cato very speedily in the mean time they are getting ready as good a sentence as the former on their side so betwixt them it is probable that cato as dr garth expressed it may have something to live upon after he dies i am  your etc  mr pope to mr addison july  0      i am more joyd at your return than i should be at that of the sun so much as i wish for him this melancholy wet season but it is his fate too like yours to be displeasing to owls and obscene animals who cannot bear his luster what put me in mind of these nightbirds was john dennis whom i think you are best revenged upon as the sun was in the fable upon those batts and beastly birds abovementioned only by shining on i am so far from esteeming it any misfortune that i congratulate you upon having your share in that which all the great men and all the good men that ever lived have had their part of envy and calumny to be uncensurd and to be obscure is the same thing you may conclude from what i here say that twas never in my thoughts to have offered you my pen in any direct reply to such a critic but only in some little raillery not in defense of you but in contempt of him this relates to the paper occasioned by denniss remarks upon cato called dr norriss narrative of the frenzy of john den but indeed your opinion that it is entirely to be neglected would have been my own had it been my own case but i felt more warmth here than i did when first i saw his book against myself though indeed in two minutes it made me heartily merry he has written against every thing the world has approved these many years i apprehend but one danger from denniss disliking our sense that it may make us think so very well of it as to become proud and conceited upon his disapprobation  i must not here omit to do justice to mr  whose zeal in your concern is worthy a friend and honourer of you he writ to me in the most pressing terms about it though with that just contempt of the critic that he deserves i think in these days one honest man is obliged to acquaint another who are his friends when so many mischievous insects are daily at work to make people of merit suspicious of each other that they may have the satisfaction of seeing them looked upon no better than themselves i am  your etc  mr addison to mr pope october         i was extremely glad to receive a letter from you but more so upon reading the contents of it the the translation of the iliad work you mention will i dare say very sufficiently recommend itself when your name appears with the proposals and if you think i can any way contribute to the forwarding of them you cannot lay a greater obligation upon me than by employing me in such an office as i have an ambition of having it known that you are my friend i shall be very proud of showing it by this or any other instance i question not but your translation will enrich our tongue and do honor to our country for i conclude of it already from those performances with which you have obliged the public i would only have you consider how it may most turn to your advantage excuse my impertinence in this particular which proceeds from my zeal for your ease and happiness the work would cost you a great deal of time and unless you undertake it will i am afraid never be executed by any other at least i know none of this age that is equal to it besides yourself  i am at present wholly immersed in country business and begin to take delight in it i wish i might hope to see you here sometime and will not despair of it when you engage in a work that will require solitude and retirement i am  your etc  mr addison to mr pope nov        i have received your letter and am glad to find that you have laid so good a scheme for your great undertaking i question not but the prose will require as much care as the poetry but the variety will give your self some relief and more pleasure to your readers  you gave me leave once to take the liberty of a friend in advising you not to content your self with one half of the nation for your admirers when you might command them all if i might take the freedom to repeat it i would on this occasion i think you are very happy that you are out of the fray and i hope all your undertakings will turn to the better account for it  you see how i presume on your friendship in taking all this freedom with you but i already fancy that we have lived many years together in an unreserved conversation and that we may do many more is the sincere wish of  your etc  mr pope to mr addison your last is the more obliging as it hints at some little niceties in my conduct which your candor and affection prompt you to recommend to me and which so trivial as things of this nature seem are yet of no slight consequence to people whom every body talks of and every body as he pleases it is a sort of tax that attends an estate in parnassus which is often rated much higher than in proportion to the small possession an author holds for indeed an author who is once come upon the town is enjoyed without being thanked for the pleasure and sometimes illtreated by those very persons that first debauched him yet to tell you the bottom of my heart i am no way displeased that i have offended the violent of all parties already and at the same time i assure you conscientiously i feel not the least malevolence or resentment against any of those who misrepresent me or are dissatisfied with me this frame of mind is so easy that i am perfectly content with my condition  as i hope and would flatter myself that you know me and my thoughts so entirely as never to be mistaken in either so it is a pleasure to me that you guessed so right in regard to the author of that guardian you mentioned but i am sorry to find it has taken air that i have some hand in those papers because i write so very few as neither to deserve the credit of such a report with some people nor the disrepute of it with others an honest jacobite spoke to me the sense or nonsense of the weak part of his party very fairly that the good people took it ill of me that i writ with steel though upon never so indifferent subjects  this i know you will laugh at as well as i do yet i doubt not but many little calumniators and persons of sower dispositions will take occasion hence to bespatter me i confess i scorn narrow souls of all parties and if i renounce my reason in religious matters i will hardly do it in any other  i cannot imagine whence it comes to pass that the few guardians i have written are so generally known for mine that in particular which you mention i never discovered to any man but the publisher till very lately yet almost every body i met told me of it  the true reason that mr steel laid down the paper was a quarrel between him and jacob tonson he stood engaged to his bookseller in articles of penalty for all the guardians and by desisting two days and altering the title of the paper to that of the englishman was quit of his obligation these papers being printed by buckley  as to his taking a more politic turn i cannot any way enter into that secret nor have i been let into it any more than into the rest of his politics though it is said he will take into these papers also several subjects of the politic kind as before but i assure you as to myself i have quite done with em for the future the little i have done and the great respect i bear mr steel as a man of wit has rendered me a suspected whig to some of the violent but as old dryden said before me it is not the violent i design to please  i generally employ the mornings in painting with mr jervas see mr popes epistle to him in verse writ about this time  and the evenings in the conversation of such as i think can most improve my mind of whatever party or denomination they are i ever must set the highest value upon men of truly great that is honest principles with equal capacities the best way i know of overcoming calumny and misconstruction is by a vigorous perseverance in every thing we know to be right and a total neglect of all that can ensue from it it is partly from this maxim that i depend upon your friendship because i believe it will do justice to my intention in every thing and give me leave to tell you that as the world goes this is no small assurance i repose in you i am  your etc  to the same dec         i have been lying in wait for my own imagination this week and more and watching what thoughts came up in the whirl of the fancy that were worth communicating to you in a letter but i am at length convinced that my rambling head can produce nothing of that sort so i must even be contented with telling you the old story that i love you heartily i have often found by experience that nature and truth though never so low or vulgar are yet pleasing when openly and artlessly represented it would be diverting to me to read the very letters of an infant could it write its innocent inconsistencies and tautologies just as it thought em this makes me hope a letter from me will not be unwelcome to you when i am conscious i write with more unreservedness than ever man wrote or perhaps talked to another i trust your good nature with the whole range of my follies and really love you so well that i would rather you should pardon me than esteem me since one is an act of goodness and benevolence the other a kind of constrained deference  you cannot wonder my thoughts are scarce consistent when i tell you how they are distracted every hour of my life my mind is strangely divided this minute perhaps i am above the stars with a thousand systems round about me looking forward into a vast abyss and losing my whole comprehension in the boundless space of creation in dialogues with w and the astronomers the next moment i am below all trifles grovelling with t in the very center of nonsense now i am recreated with the brisk sallies and quick turns of wit which mr steel in his liveliest and freest humors darts about him and now levelling my application to the insignificant observations and quirks of grammar of mr  and d  good god what an incongruous animal is man how unsettled is his best part his soul and how changing and variable in his frame of body the constancy of the one shook by every notion the temperament of the other affected by every blast of wind what is man altogether but one mighty inconsistency sickness and pain is the lot of one half of us doubt and fear the portion of the other what a bustle we make about passing our time when all our space is but a point what aims and ambitions are crowded into this little instant of our life which as shakespeare finely words it is rounded with a sleep our whole extent of being no more in the eyes of him who gave it than a scarce perceptible moment of duration those animals whose circle of living is limited to three or four hours as the naturalists assure us are yet as longlived and possess as wide a scene of action as man if we consider him with an eye to all space and all eternity who knows what plots what achievements a mite may perform in his kingdom of a grain of dust within his le of some minutes and of how much less consideration than even this is the life of man in the sight of that god who is from ever and for ever  who that thinks in this train but must see the world and its contemptible grandeurs lessen before him at every thought it is enough to make one remain stupifyd in a poize of inaction void of all desires of all designs of all friendships  but we must return through our very condition of being to our narrow selves and those things that affect our selves our passions our interests flow in upon us and unphilosophize us into mere mortals for my part i never return so much into myself as when i think of you whose friendship is one of the best comforts i have for the insignificancy of myself i am  your etc  to the same jan  0       your letter found me very busy in my grand undertaking to which i must wholly give myself up for some time unless when i snatch an hour to please myself with a distant conversation with you and a few others by writing it is no comfortable prospect to be reflecting that so long a siege as that of troy lies upon my hands and the campaign above half over before i have made any progress indeed the greek fortification upon a nearer approach does not appear so formidable as it did and i am almost apt to flotter myself that homer secretly seems inclined to a correspondence with me in letting me into a good part of his intentions there are indeed a sort of underling auxiliars to the difficulty of a work called commentators and critics who would frighten many people by their number and bulk and perplex our progress under pretense of fortifying their author these lie very low in the trenches and ditches they themselves have dug encompassed with dirt of their own heaping up but i think there may be found a method of coming at the main works by a more speedy and gallant way than by mining under ground that is by using the poetical engines wings and flying over their heads  while i am engaged in the fight i find you are concerned how i shall be paid and are sollicitous that i may not have the ill fate of many discarded generals to be first envied and malignd then perhaps praised and lastly neglected the former the constant attendant upon all great and laudable enterprises i have already experienced some have said i am not a master in the greek who either are so themselves or are not if they are not they cannot tell and if they are they cannot without having catechized me but if they can read for i know some critics can and others cannot there are fairly lying before them some specimens of my translation from this author in the miscellanies which they are heartily welcome to i have met with as much malignity another way some calling me a tory because the heads of that party have been distinguishingly favorable to me some a whig because i have been favored with yours mr congreves and mr craggs his friendship and of late with my lord hallifaxs patronage how much more natural a conclusion might be formed by any goodnatured man that a person who has been well used by all sides has been offensive to none this miserable age is so sunk between animosities of party and those of religion that i begin to fear most men have politics enough to make through violence the best scheme of government a bad one and faith enough to hinder their own salvation i hope for my own part never to have more of either than is consistent with common justice and charity and always as much as becomes a christian and honest man though i find it an unfortunate thing to be bred a papist here where one is obnoxious to four parts in five as being so too much and to the fifth part as being so too little i shall yet be easy under both their mistakes and be what i more than seem to be for i suffer for it god is my witness that i no more envy you protestants your places and possessions than i do our priests their charity or learning i am ambitious of nothing but the good opinion of good men on both sides for i know that one virtue of a free spirit is more worth than all the virtues put together of all the narrowsould people in the world i am  your etc  the reverend dean berkley to mr pope leghorne may        as i take ingratitude to be a greater crime than impertinence i choose rather to run the risque of being thought guilty of the latter than not to return you my thanks for a very agreeable entertainment you just now gave me i have accidentally met with your rape of the lock here having never seen it before style painting judgment spirit i had already admired in others of your writings but in this i am charmed with the magic of your invention with all those images allusions and inexplicable beauties which you raise so surprizingly and at the same time so naturally out of a trifle and yet i cannot say that i was more pleased with the reading of it than i am with the pretext it gives me to renew in your thoughts the remembrance of one who values no happiness beyond the friendship of men of wit learning and good nature  i remember to have heard you mention some halfformed design of coming to italy what might we not expect from a muse that sings so well in the bleak climate of england if she felt the same warm sun and breathed the same air with virgil and horace  there are here an incredible number of poets that have all the inclination but want the genius or perhaps the art of the ancients some among them who understand english begin to relish our authors and i am informed that at florence they have translated milton into italian verse if one who knows so well how to write like the old latin poets came among them it would probably be a means to retrieve them from their cold trivial conceits to an imitation of their predecessors  as merchants antiquaries men of pleasure etc have all different views in traveling i know not whether it might not be worth a poets while to travel in order to store his mind with strong images of nature  green fields and groves flowery meadows and purling streams are no where in such perfection as in england but if you would know lightsome days warm suns and blue skies you must come to italy and to enable a man to describe rocks and precipices it is absolutely necessary that he pass the alps  you will easily perceive that it is selfinterest makes me so fond of giving advice to one who has no need of it if you came into these parts i should fly to see you i am here by the favor of my good friend the dean of st patricks in quality of chaplain to the earl of peterborough who about three months since left the greatest part of his family in this town god knows how long we shall stay here i am  your etc  mr pope to the honorable june        the question you ask in relation to mr ad and philips i shall answer in a few words mr philips did express himself with much indignation against me one evening at buttons coffeehouse as i was told saying that i was entered into a cabal with dean swift and others to write against the whiginterest and in particular to undermine his own reputation and that of his friends steel and addison but mr philips never opened his lips to my face on this or any like occasion though i was almost every night in the same room with him nor ever offered me any indecorum mr addison came to me a night or two after philips had talked in this idle manner and assured me of his disbelief of what had been said of the friendship we should always maintain and desired i would say nothing further of it my lord hallifax did me the honor to stir in this matter by speaking to several people to obviate a false aspersion which might have done me no small prejudice with one party however philips did all he could secretly to continue the report with the hanover club and kept in his hands the subscriptions paid for me to him as secretary to that club the heads of it have since given him to understand that they take it ill but upon the terms i ought to be with a man whom i think a scoundrel i would not even ask him for this money but commissioned one of the players his equals to receive it this is the whole matter but as to the secret grounds of philipss malignity they will make a very pleasant history when we meet mr congreve and some others have been much diverted with it and most of the gentlemen of the hanover club have made it the subject of their ridicule on their secretary it is to this management of philips that the world owes mr gays pastorals the ingenious author is extremely your servant and would have complied with your kind invitation but that he is just now appointed secretary to my lord clarendon in his embassy to hanover  i am sensible of the zeal and friendship with which i am sure you will always defend your friend in his absence from all those little tales and calumnies which a man of any genius or merit is born to i shall never complain while i am happy in such noble defenders and in such contemptible opponents may their envy and ill nature ever increase to the glory and pleasure of those they would injure may they represent me what they will as long as you think me what i am  your etc  to the same july         you mention the account i gave you some time ago of the things which philips said in his foolishness but i cannot tell from any thing in your letter whether you received a long one from me about a fortnight since it was principally intended to thank you for the last obliging favor you did me and perhaps for that reason you pass it in silence i there launched into some account of my temporal affairs and intend now to give you some hints of my spiritual the conclusion of your letter draws this upon you where you tell me you prayed for me your proceeding sir is contrary to that of most other friends who never talk of praying for a man after they have done him a service but only when they will do him none nothing can be more kind than the hint you give me of the vanity of human sciences which i assure you i am daily more and more convined of and indeed i have for some years past looked upon all of em no better than amusements to make them the ultimate end of our pursuit is a miserable and short ambition which will drop from us at every little disappointments here and even in case of no disappointmentr here will infallibly desert us hereafter the utmost fame they are capable of bestowing is never worth the pains they cost us and the time they lose us if you attain the top of your desires that way all those who envy you will do you harm and of those who admire you few will do you good the unsuccessful writers are your declared enemies and probably the successful your secret ones for those hate not more to be excelled than these to be rivalled and at the upshot after a life of perpetual application to reflect that you have been doing nothing for yourself and that the same or less industry might have gained you a friendship that can never deceive or end a satisfaction which praise cannot bestow nor vanity feel and a glory which though in one respect like same not to be had till after death yet shall be felt and enjoyed to eternity these dear sir are unfeignedly my sentiments whenever i think at all for half the things that employ our heads deserve not the name of thoughts they are only stronger dreams or impressions upon the imagination our schemes of government our systems of philosophy our golden worlds of poetry are all but so many shadowy images and airy prospects which arise to us but so much the livelier and more frequent as we are more overcast with the darkness and disturbed with the fumes of human vanity  the same thing that makes old men willing to leave this world makes me willing to leave poetry long habit and weariness of the same track homer will work a cure upon me fifteen thousand verses are equivalent to fourscore years to make one old in rhyme and i should be sorry and ashamed to go on jingling to the last step like a waggoners horse in the same road and so leave my bells to the next silly animal that will be proud of em that man makes a mean figure in the eyes of reason who is measuring syllables and coupling rhimes when he should be mending his own soul and securing his own immortality if i had not this opinion i should be unworthy even of those small and limited parts which god has given me and unworthy of the friendship of such a man as you i am  your etc  to the same july         i have no better excuse to offer you that i have omitted a task naturally so pleasing to me as conversing upon paper with you but that my time and eyes have been wholly employed upon homer whom i almost fear i shall find but one way of imitating which is in his blindness i am perpetually afflicted with headachs that very much affect my sight and indeed since my coming hither i have scarce passed an hour agreeably except that in which i read your letter i would seriously have you think you have no man who more truly knows to place a right value on your friendship than he who least deserves it on all other accounts than his due sense of it but let me tell you you can hardly guess what a task you undertake when you profess your self my friend there are some tories who will take you for a whig some whigs who will take you for a tory some protestants who will esteem you a rank papist and some papists who will account you a heretic  i find by dear experience we live in an age where it is criminal to be moderate and where no one man can be allowed to be just to all men the notions of right and wrong are so far strained that perhaps to be in the right so very violently may be of worse consequence than to be easily and quietly in the wrong i really wish all men so well that i am satisfied but few can wish me so but if those few are such as tell me they do i am content for they are the best people i know while you believe me what i profess as to religion i can bear any thing the bigoted may say while mr congreve likes my poetry i can endure dennis and a thousand more like him while the most honest and moral of each party think me no ill man i can easily support it though the most violent and mad of all parties rose up to throw dirt at me  i must expect an hundred attacks upon the publication of my homer whoever in our times would be a professor of learning above his fellows ought at the very first to enter the world with the constancy and resolution of a primitive christian and be prepared to suffer all sorts of public persecution it is certainly to be lamented that if any man does but endeavor to distinguish himself or gratify others by his studies he is immediately treated as a common enemy instead of being looked upon as a common friend and assaulted as generally as if his whole design were to prejudice the state and ruin the public i will venture to say no man ever rose to any degree of perfection in writing but through obstinacy and an inveterate resolution against the stream of mankind so that if the world has received any benefit from the labors of the learned it was in its own despite for when first they essay their parts all people in general are prejudiced against new beginners and when they have got a little above contempt then some particular persons who were before unfortunate in their own attempts are sworn foes to them only because they succeed  upon the whole one may say of the best writers that they pay a severe fine for their fame which it is always in the power of the most worthless part of mankind to levy upon them when they please  i am etc  to mr jervas july         i am just entered upon the old way of life again sleep and musing it is my employment to revive the old of past ages to the present as it is yours to transmit the young of the present to the future i am copying the great master in one art with the same love and diligence with which the painter hereafter will copy you in another  thus i should begin my epistle to you if it were a dedicatory one but as it is a friendly letter you are to find nothing mentioned in your own praise but what only one in the world is witness to your particular goodnatured offices to me whatever mankind in general would allow you that i am not to give you to your face and if i were to do it in your absence the world would tell me i am too partial to be permitted to pass any judgment of you  so you see me cut out from any thing but common acknowledgments or common discourse the first you would take ill though i told you but half what i ought so in short the last only remains  and as for the last what can you expect from a man who has not talked these five days who is withdrawing his thoughts as far as he can from all the present world its customs and its manners to be fully possessed and absorpt in the past when people talk of going to church i think of sacrifices and libations when i see the parson i address him as chryses priest of apollo and instead of the lords prayer i begin  god of the silver bow etc while you in the world are concerned about the protestant succession i consider only how menelaus may recover helen and the trojan war be put to a speedy conclusion i never inquire if the queen be well or not but heartily wish to be at hectors funeral the only things i regard in this life are whether my friends are well whether my translation go well on whether dennis be writing criticisms whether any body will answer him since i dont and whether lintott be not yet broke  i am etc  to the same august         i thank you for your good offices which are numberless homer advances so fast that he begins to look about for the ornaments he is to appear in like a modish modern author   picture in the front with bays and wicked ryme upon it   i have the greatest proof in nature at present of the amusing power of poetry for it takes me up so entirely that i scarce see what passes under my nose and hear nothing that is said about me to follow poetry as one ought one must forget father and mother and cleave to it alone my reverie has been so deep that i have scarce had an interval to think myself uneasy in the want of your company i now and then just miss you as i step into bed this minute indeed i want extremely to see you the next i shall dream of nothing but the taking of troy or the recovery of briseis  i fancy no friendship is so likely to prove lasting as ours because i am pretty sure there never was a friendship of so easy a nature we neither of us demand any mighty things from each other what vanity we have expects its gratification from other people it is not i that am to tell you what an artist you are nor is it you that are to tell me what a poet i am but it is from the world abroad we hope piously hope to hear these things at home we follow our business when we have any and think and talk most of each other when we have none it is not unlike the happy friendship of a stayed man and his wife who are seldom so fond as to hinder the business of the house from going on all day or so indolent as not to find consolation in each other every evening thus wellmeaning couples hold in amity to the last by not expecting too much from human nature while romantic friendships like violent loves begin with disquiets proceed to jealousies and conclude in animosities i have lived to see the fierce advancement the sudden turn and the abrupt period of three or four of these enormous friendships and am perfectly convinced of the truth of a maxim we once agreed in that nothing hinders the constant agreement of people who live together but mere vanity a secret insisting upon what they think their dignity or merit and an inward expectation of such an overmeasure of deference and regard as answers to their own extravagant false scale and which no body can pay because none but themselves can tell exactly to what pitch it amounts  i am etc  mr pope to edward blount esquire aug         whatever studies on the one hand or amusements on the other it shall be my fortune to fall into i shall be equally incapable of forgetting you in any of em the task i undertook the translation of homers iliad  though of weight enough in itself has had a voluntary increase by the enlarging my design of the notes and the necessity of consulting a number of books has carried me to oxford but i fear through my lord harcourts and dr clarks means i shall be more conversant with the pleasures and company of the place than with the books and manuscripts of it  i find still more reason to complain of the negligence of the geographers in their maps of old greece since i looked upon two or three more noted names in the public libraries here but with all the care i am capable of i have some cause to fear the engraver will prejudice me in a few situations i have been forced to write to him in so high a style that were my epistle intercepted it would raise no small admiration in an ordinary man there is scarce an order in it of less importance than to remove such and such mountains alter the course of such and such rivers place a large city on such a coast and raze another in another country i have set bounds to the sea and said to the land thus far shall thou advance and no further this relates to the map of ancient greece laid down by our author in his observations on the second iliad  in the mean time i who talk and command at this rate am in danger of loosing my horse and stand in some fear of a country justice to disarm me indeed may be but prudential considering what armies i have at present on foot and in my service a hundred thousand grecians are no contemptible body for all that i can tell they may be as formidable as four thousand priests and they seem proper forces to send against those in barcelona that siege deserves as fine a poem as the iliad and the machining part of poetry would be the juster in it as they say the inhabitants expect angels from heaven to their assistance may i venture to say who am a papist and to say to you who are a papist that nothing is more astonishing to me than that people so greatly warmed with a sense of liberty should be capable of harboring such weak superstition and that so much bravery and so much folly can inhabit the same breasts  i could not but take a trip to london on the death of the queen moved by the common curiosity of mankind who leave their own business to be looking upon other mens i thank god that as for myself i am below all the accidents of statechanges by my circumstances and above them by my philosophy common charity of man to man and universal good will to all are the points i have most at heart and i am sure those are not to be broken for the sake of any governors or government i am willing to hope the best and what i more wish than my own or any particular mans advancement is that this turn may put an end entirely to the divisions of whig and tory that the parties may love each other as well as i love them both or at least hurt each other as little as i would either and that our own people may live as quietly as we shall certainly let theirs that is to say that want of power itself in us may not be a surer prevention of harm than want of will in them i am sure if all whigs and all tories had the spirit of one roman catholic that i know it would be well for all roman catholics and if all roman catholics had always had that spirit it had been well for all others and we had never been charged with so wicked a spirit as that of persecution  i agree with you in my sentiment of the state of our nation since this change i find myself just in the same situation of mind you describe as your own heartily wishing the good that is the quiet of my country and hoping a total end of all the unhappy divisions of mankind by partyspirit which at best is but the madness of many for the gain of a few  i am etc  mr jervas to mr pope aug  0      i have a particular to tell you at this time which pleases me so much that you must expect a more than ordinary alacrity in every turn you know i could keep you in suspense for twenty lines but i will tell you directly that mr addison and i have had a conversation that it would have been worth your while to have been placed behind the wainscot or behind some halflength picture to have heard he assured me that he would make use not only of his interest but of his art to do you some service he did not mean his art of poetry but his art at court and he is sensible that nothing can have a better air for himself than moving in your favor especially since insinuations were spread that he did not care you should prosper too much as a poet he protests that it shall not be his fault if there is not the best intelligence in the world and the most hearty friendship etc he owns he was afraid dr swift might have carried you too far among the enemy during the heat of the animosity but now all is safe and you are escaped even in his opinion i promised in your name like a good godfather not that you should renounce the devil and all his works but that you would be delighted to find him your friend merely for his own sake therefore prepare yourself for some civilities  i have done homers head shadowed and heightened carefully and i enclose the outline of the same size that you may determine whether you would have it so large or reduced to make room for a feuillage or laurel round the oval or about the square of the busto perhaps there is something more solemn in the image itself if i can get it well performed  if i have been instrumenal in bringing you and mr addison together with all sincerity i value myself upon it as an acceptable piece of service to such a one as i know you to be  your etc  mr popes answer aug         i am just arrived from oxford very well diverted and entertained there  all very honest fellows  much concerned for the queens death no panegyricks ready yet for the king  i admire your whigprinciples of resistance exceedingly in the spirit of the barcelonians i join in your wish for them mr addisons verses on liberty in his letter from italy would be a good form of prayer in my opinion o liberty thou goddess heavenly bright etc  what you mentioned of the friendly office you endeavored to do betwixt mr addison and me deserves acknowledgments on my part you thoroughly know my regard to his character and my propensity to testify it by all ways in my power you as thoroughly know the scandalous meanness of that proceeding which was used by philips to make a man i so highly value suspect my dispositions toward him but as after all mr addison must be the judge in what regards himself and has seemed to be no very just one to me so i must own to you i expect nothing but civility from him how much soever i wish for his friendship and as for any offices of real kindness or service which it is in his power to do me i should be ashamed to receive em from any man who had no better opinion of my morals than to think me a partyman nor of my temper than to believe me capable of maligning or envying anothers reputation as a poet so i leave it to time to convince him as to both to show him the shallow depths of those halfwitted creatures who misinformd him and to prove that i am incapable of endeavoring to lessen a person whom i would be proud to imitate and therefore ashamed to flatter in a word mr addison is sure of my respect at all times and of my real friendship whenever he shall think fit to know me for what i am  for all that passed betwixt dr swift and me you know the whole without reserve of our correspondence the engagements i had to him were such as the actual services he had done me in relation to the subscription for homer obliged me to i must have leave to be grateful to him and to any one who serves me let him be never so obnoxious to any party nor did the toryparty ever put me to the hardship of asking this leave which is the greatest obligation i owe to it and i expect no greater from the whigparty than the same liberty  a curse on the word party which i have been forced to use so often in this period i wish the present reign may put an end to the distinction that there may be no other for the future than that of honest and knave fool and men of sense these two sorts must always be enemies but for the rest may all people do as you and i believe what they please and be friends  i am etc  mr pope to mr addison october  0      i have been acquainted by one of my friends who omits no opportunities of gratifying me that you have lately been pleased to speak of me in a manner which nothing but the real respect i have for you can deserve may i hope that some late malevolencies have lost their effect indeed it is neither for me nor my enemies to pretend to tell you whether i am your friend or not but if you would judge by probabilities i beg to know which of your poetical acquaintance has so little interest in pretending to be so methinks no man should question the real friendship of one who desires no real service i am only to get as much from the whigs as i got by the tories that is to say civility being neither so proud as to be insensible of any good office nor so humble as not to dare heartily to despise any man who does me an injustice  i will not value myself upon having ever guarded all the degrees of respect for you for to say the truth all the world speaks well of you and i should be under a necessity of doing the same whether i cared for you or not  as to what you have said of me i shall never believe that the author of cato can speak one thing and think another as a proof that i account you sincere i beg a favor of you it is that you would look over the two first books of my translation of homer which are now in the hands of my lord halifax i am sensible how much the reputation of any poetical work will depend upon the character you give it it is therefore some evidence of the trust i repose in your good will when i give you this opportunity of speaking ill of me with justice and yet expect you will tell me your truest thoughts at the same time that you tell others your most favorable ones  i have a farther request which i must press with earnestness my bookseller is reprinting the essay on criticism to which you have done too much honor in your spectator of no     the period in that paper where you say i have admitted some strokes of ill nature into that essay is the only one i could wish omitted of all you have written but i would not desire it should be so unless i had the merit of removing your objection i beg you but to point out those strokes to me and you may be assured they shall be treated without mercy  since we are upon proofs of sincerity which i am pretty confident will turn to the advantage of us both in each others opinion give me leave to name another passage in the same spectator which i wish you would alter it is where you mention an observation upon homers verses of sysiphuss stone these words are since lest out in mr tickels edition but were extant in all during mr addisons life never having been made before by any of the critics i happened to find the same in dyonisius of halicarnassuss treatise  who treats very largely upon these verses i know you will think fit to soften your expression when you see the passage which you must needs have read tho it be since slipped out of your memory i am with the utmost esteem  your etc  mr pope to the earl of halifax dec        my lord i am obliged to you both for the favors you have done me and for those you intend me i distrust neither your will nor your memory when it is to do good and if ever i become troublesome or sollicitous it must not be out of expectation but out of gratitude your lordship may either cause me to live agreeably in the town or contentedly in the country which is really all the difference i set between an easy fortune and a small one it is indeed a high strain of generosity in you to think of making me easy all my life only because i have been so happy as to divert you some few hours but if i may have leave to add it is because you think me no enemy to my native country there will appear a better reason for i must of consequence be very much as i sincerely am  my lord etc portrait of william congreve mr william congreve m vdr gucht sculp    mr pope to mr congreve jan           methinks when i write to you i am making a confession i have got i cannot tell how such a custom of throwing myself out upon paper without reserve you were not mistaken in what you judged of my temper of mind when i writ last my faults will not be hid from you and perhaps it is no dispraise to me that they will not the cleanness and purity of ones mind is never better proved than in discovering its own faults at first view as when a stream shows the dirt at its bottom it shows also the transparency of the water  my spleen was not occasioned however by any thing an dennis who writ an abusive pamphlet this year entitled remarks on mr pope s homer abusive angry critic could write of me i take very kindly your heroic manner of congratulation upon this scandal for i think nothing more honorable than to be involved in the same fate with all the great and the good that ever lived that is to be envied and censured by bad writers  you do no more than answer my expectations of you in declaring how well you take my freedom in sometimes neglecting as i do to reply to your letters so soon as i ought those who have a right taste of the substantial part of friendship can wave the ceremonial a friend is the only one that will bear the omission and one may find who is not so by the very trial of it  as to any anxiety i have concerning the fate of my homer the care is over with me the world must be the judge and i shall be the first to consent to the justice of its judgment whatever it be i am not so arrant an author as even to desire that if i am in the wrong all mankind should be so  i am mightily pleased with a saying of monsieur tourreil when a man writes he ought to animate himself with the thoughts of pleasing all the world but he is to renounce that desire or hope the very moment the book goes out of his hands  i write this from binfield whither i came yesterday having past a few days in my way with my lord bolingbroke i go to london in three days time and will not fail to pay a visit to mr m whom i saw not long since at my lord halifaxs i hoped from thence he had some hopes of advantage from the present administration for few people i think but i pay respects to great men without any prospects i am in the fairest way in the world of being not worth a groat being born both a papist and a poet this puts me in mind of reacknowledging your continued endeavors to enrich me but i can tell you it is to no purpose for without the opes aequum animum mi ipse parabo  i am your etc  mr pope to mr congreve march           the farce of the whatdyecall it has occasioned many different speculations in the town some looked upon it as mere jest upon the tragic poets others as a satire upon the late war mr cromwell hearing none of the words and seeing the action to be tragical was much astonished to find the audience laugh and says the prince and princess must doubtless be under no less amazement on the same account several templers and others of the more vociferous kind of critics went with a resolution to hiss and confessed they were forced to laugh so much that they forgot the design they came with the court in general has in a very particular manner come into the jest and the three first nights notwithstanding two of them were courtnights were distinguished by very full audiences of the first quality the common people of the pit and gallery received it at first with great gravity and sedateness some few with tears but after the third day they also took the hint and have ever since been very loud in their claps there are still some sober men who cannot be of the general opinion but the laughers are so much the majority that one or two critics seem determined to undeceive the town at their proper cost by writing grave dissertations against it to encourage them in which laudable design it is resolved a preface shall be prefixed to the farce in vindication of the nature and dignity of this new way of writing  yesterday mr steeles affair was decided i am sorry i can be of no other opinion than yours as to his whole carriage and writings of late but certainly he has not only been punished by others but suffered much even from his own party in the point of character nor i believe received any amends in that of interest as yet whatever may be his prospects for the future  this gentleman among a thousand others is a great instance of the fate of all who are carried away by partyspirit of any side i wish all violence may succeed as ill but am really amazed that so much of that sower and pernicious quality should be joined with so much natural good humor as i think mr steel is possessed of  i am etc  to mr congreve april        mr pope is going to mr jervass where mr addison is sitting for his picture in the mean time amidst clouds of tobacco at a coffeehouse i write this letter there is a grand revolution at wills morris has quitted for a coffeehouse in the city and titcomb is restored to the great joy of cromwell who was at a great loss for a person to converse with upon the fathers and church history the knowledge i gain from him is entirely in painting and poetry and mr pope owes all his skill in astronomy to him and mr whiston so celebrated of late for his discovery of the longitude in an extraordinary copy of verses called an ode on the longitude in swift s and pope s miscellanies mr rowes jane gray is to be played in easterweek when mrs oldfield is to personate a character directly opposite to female nature for what woman ever despised sovereignty you know chaucer has a tale where a knight saves his head by discovering it was the thing which all women most covered mr popes homer is retarded by the great rains that have fallen of late which causes the sheets to be long a drying this gives mr lintot great uneasiness who is now endeavoring to corrupt the curate of his parish to pray for fair weather that his work may go on there is a sixpenny criticism lately published upon the tragedy of the whatdyecallit wherein he with much judgment and learning calls me a blockhead and mr pope a knave his grand charge is against the pilgrims progress being read which he says is directly levelled at catos reading plato to back his censure he goes on to tell you that the pilgrims progress being mentioned to be the eighth edition makes the reflection evident the tragedy of cato having just eight times as he quaintly expresses it visited the press he has also endeavored to show that every particular passage of the play alludes to some fine part of tragedy which he says i have injudiciously and profanely abused this curious piece was entitled a complete key to the whatdyecallit it was written by one griffin a player assisted by lewis theobald sir samuel garths poem upon my lord clares house i believe will be published in the easterweek  thus far mr gay  who has in his letter forestalled all the subjects of diversion unless it should be one to you to say that i sit up till two aclock over burgundy and champagne and am become so much a rake that i shall be ashamed in a short time to be thought to do any sort of business i fear i must get the gout by drinking purely for a fashionable pretense to sit still long enough to translate four books of homer i hope you will by that time be up again and i may succeed to the bed and couch of my predecessor pray cause the stuffing to be repaired and the crutches shortened for me the calamity of your gout is what all your friends that is to say all that know you must share in we desire you in your turn to condole with us who are under a persecution and much afflicted with a distemper which proves grievous to many poets a criticism we have indeed some relieving intervals of laughter as you know there are in some diseases and it is the opinion of diverse good guessers that the last fit will not be more violent than advantageous for poets assailed by critics are like men bitten by tarantulas they dance on so much the faster  mr thomas burnet has played the precursor to the coming of homer in a treatise called homerides he has since risen very much in his criticisms and after assaulting homer made a daring attack upon the in one of his papers called the grumbler long since dead whatdyecallit yet is there not a proclamation issued for the burning of homer and the pope by the common hangman nor is the what do you callit yet silenced by the lord chamberlain they shall survive the conflagration of his fathers works and live after they and he are damned for that the bp of s already is so is the opinion of dr sacheverel and the church of rome  i am etc  mr pope to the earl of b   my lord if your mare could speak she would give you an account of the extraordinary company she had on the road which since she cannot do i will  it was the enterprizing mr lintott the redoubtable rival of mr tonson who mounted on a stonehorse no disagreeable companion to your lordships mare overtook me in windsorforest he said he heard i designed for oxford the seat of the muses and would as my bookseller by all means accompany me thither  i asked him where he got his horse he answered he got it of his publisher for that rogue my printer said he disappointed me i hoped to put him in good humor by a treat at the tavern of a brown fricassee of rabbits which cost two shillings with two quarts of wine besides my conversation i thought myself cocksure of his horse which he readily promised me but said that mr tonson had just such another design of going to cambridge expecting there the copy of a comment upon the revelations and if mr tonson went he was preingaged to attend him being to have the printing of the said copy  so in short i borrowed this stonehorse of my publisher which he had of mr oldmixon for a debt he lent me too the pretty boy you see after me he was a smutty dog yesterday and cost me near two hours to wash the ink off his face but the devil is a fairconditiond devil and very forward in his catechize if you have any more bags he shall carry them  i thought mr lintotts civility not to be neglected so gave the boy a small bagg containing three shirts and an elvezir virgil and mounting in an instant proceeded on the road with my man before my courteous stationer beside and the aforesaid devil behind  mr lintott began in this manner now damn them what if they should put it into the newspaper how you and i went together to oxford why what would i care if i should go down into sussex they would say i was gone to the speaker but what of that if my son were but big enough to go on with the business by gd i would keep as good company as old jacob  hereupon i inquired of his son the lad says he has fine parts but is somewhat sickly much as you are  i spare for nothing in his education at westminster pray dont you think westminster to be the best school in england most of the late ministry came out of it so did many of this ministry i hope the boy will make his fortune  dont you design to let him pass a year at oxford to what purpose said he the universities do but make pedants and i intend to breed him a man of business  as mr lintott was talking i observed he sat uneasy on his saddle for which i expressed some solicitude nothing says he i can bear it well enough but since we have the day before us methinks it would be very pleasant for you to rest a while under the woods when we were alighted see here what a mighty pretty horace i have in my pocket what if you amused yourself in turning an ode till we mount again lord if you pleased what a clever miscellany might you make at leisure hours perhaps i may said i if we ride on the motion is an aid to my fancy a round trot very much awakens my spirits then jog on apace and i will think as hard as i can  silence ensued for a full hour after which mr lintott luggd the reins stepped short and broke out well sir how far have you gone i answered seven miles zds sir said lintott i thought you had done seven stanzas oldsworth in a ramble round wimbletonhill would translate a whole ode in half this time i will say that for oldsworth though i lost by his timothys he translates an ode of horace the quickest of any man in england i remember dr king would write verses in a tavern three hours after he could nt speak and there is sir richard in that rumbling old chariot of his between fleetditch and st giless pound shall make you half a job  pray mr lintott said i now you talk of translators what is your method of managing them sir replied he those are the saddest pack of rogues in the world in a hungry fit they will swear they understand all the languages in the universe i have known one of them take down a greek book upon my counter and cry ay this is hebrew i must read it from the latter end by gd i can never be sure in these fellows for i neither understand greek latin french nor italian myself but this is my way i agree with them for ten shillings per sheet with a proviso that i will have their doings corrected by whom i please so by one or other they are led at last to the true sense of an author my judgment giving the negative to all my translators but how are you secure that those correctors may not impose upon you why i get any civil gentleman especially any scotchman that comes into my shop to read the original to me in english by this i know whether my first translator be deficient and whether my corrector merits his money or no  i will tell you what happened to me last month i bargained with s for a new version of lucretius to publish against tonsons agreeing to pay the author so many shillings at his producing so many lines he made a great progress in a very short time and i gave it to the corrector to compare with the latin but he went directly to creechs translation and found it the same word for word all but the first page now what do you think i did i arrested the translator for a cheat nay and i stopped the correctors pay too upon this proof that he had made use of creech instead of the original  pray tell me next how you deal with the critics sir said he nothing more easy i can silence the most formidable of them the rich ones for a sheet a piece of the blotted manuscript which costs me nothing they will go about with it to their acquaintance and pretend they had it from the author who submitted to their correction this has given some of them such an air that in time they come to be consulted with and dedicated too as the top critics of the town  as for the poor critics i will give you one instance of my management by which you may guess at the rest a lean man that looked like a good scholar came to me the other day he turned over homer shook his head shruggd up his shoulders and pishd at every line of it one would wonder says he at the strange presumption of men homer is no such easy task that every stripling every versisier  he was going on when my wife called to dinner sir said i will you please to eat a piece of beef with me mr lintott said he i am sorry you should be at the expense of this great book i am really concerned on your account  sir i am much obliged to you if you can dine upon a piece of beef together with a slice of pudding  mr lintott i do not say but mr pope if he would condescend to advise with men of learning  sir the pudding is upon the table if you please to go in  my critic complies he comes to a taste of your poetry and tells me in the same breath that the book is commendable and the pudding excellent  now sir concluded mr lintott in return to the frankness i have shown pray tell me is it the opinion of your friends at court that my lord l will be brought to the bar or not i told him i heard not and i hoped it my lord being one i had particular obligations to that may be replied mr lintott but by gd if he is not i shall lose the printing of a very good trial  these my lord are a few traits by which you may discern the genius of my friend mr lintott which i have chosen for the subject of a letter i dropped him as soon as i got to oxford and paid a visit to my lord carlton at middleton  the conversations i enjoy here are not to be prejudiced by my pen and the pleasures from them only to be equaled when i meet your lordship i hope in a few days to cast myself from your horse at your feet  i am etc  dr parnelle to mr pope jun         i am writing you a long letter but all the tediousness i feel in it is that it makes me during the time think more intently of my being far from you i fancy if i were with you i could remove some of the uneasiness which you may have felt from the opposition of the world and which you should be ashamed to feel since it is but the testimony which one part of it gives you that your merit is unquestionable what would you have otherwise from ignorance envy or those tempers which vie with you in your own way i know this in mankind that when our ambition is unable to attain its end it is not only wearied but exasperated too at the vanity of its labors then we speak ill of happier studies and sighing condemn the excellence which we find above our reach   my printed for b lintott       o under this title zoilus which you used to write about i finished last spring and left in town i waited till i came up to send it you but not arriving here before your book was out imagined it a lost piece of labor if you will still have it you need only write me word  i have here seen the first book of homer which came out at a time when it could not but appear as a kind of setting up against you my opinion is that you may if you please give them thanks who writ it neither the numbers nor the spirit have an equal mastery with yours but what surprises me more is that a scholar being concerned there should happen to be some mistakes in the authors sense such as putting the light of pallass eyes into the eyes of achilles making the taunt of achilles to agamemnon that he should have spoils when troy should be taken to be a cool and serious proposal the translating what you call ablution by the word offals and so leaving water out of the rite of lustration etc but you must have taken notice of all this before i write not to inform you but to show i always have you at heart  i am etc  from a letter of the reverend doctor berkley dean of londonderry july         some days ago three or four gentlemen and myself exerting that right which all readers pretend to over authors sat in judgment upon the two new translations of the first iliad without partiality to my countrymen i assure you they all gave the preference where it was due being unanimously of opinion that yours was equally just to the sense with mr s and without comparison more easy more poetical and more sublime but i will say no more on such a threadbare subject as your late performance is at this time  i am etc  extract from a letter from mr gay to mr pope july         i have just set down sir samuel garth at the opera he bid me tell you that every body is pleased with your translation but a few at buttons and that sir richard steel told him that mr addison said tickels translation was the best that ever was in any language sir richard steel afterward in his preface to an edition of the drummer a comedy by mr addison shows it to be his opinion that  not mr tickel but mr addison himself was the person that translated this book  he treated me with extreme civility and out of kindness gave me a squeeze by the sore finger  i am informed that at buttons your character is made very free with as to morals etc and mr a says that your translation and tickels are both very well done but that the latter has more of homer  i am etc  extract from a letter of dr arbuthnot to mr pope july         i congratulate you upon mr tickels first book it does not indeed want its merit but i was strangely disappointed in my expectation of a translation nicely true to the original whereas in those parts where the greatest exactness seems to be demanded he has been the least careful i mean the history of ancient ceremonies and rites etc in which you have with great judgment been exact  i am etc  mr pope to the honorable james craggs esquire july         i lay hold of the opportunity given me by my lord duke of shrewsbury to assure you of the continuance of that esteem and affection i have long borne you and the memory of so many agreeable conversations as we have passed together i wish it were a compliment to say such conversations as are not to be found on this side of the water for the spirit of dissension is gone forth among us nor is it a wonder that buttons is no longer buttons when old england is no longer old england that region of hospitality society and good humor party affects us all even the wits though they gain as little by politics as they do by their wit we talk much of fine sense refined sense and exalted sense but for use and happiness give me a little common sense i say this in regard to some gentlemen professed wits of our acquaintance who fancy they can make poetry of consequence at this time of day in the midst of this raging fit of politics for they tell me the busy part of the nation are not more divided about whig and tory than these idle fellows of the feather about mr tickels and my translation i like the tories have the town in general that is the mob on my side but it is usual with the smaller party to make up in industry what they want in number and that is the case with the little senate of cato however if our principles be well considered i must appear a brave whig and mr tickel a rank tory i translated homer for the public in general he to gratify the inordinate desires of one man only we have it seems a great turk in poetry who can never bear a brother on the throne and has his mutes too a set of nodders winkers and whisperers whose business is to strangle all other offsprings of wit in their birth the new translator of homer is the humblest slave he has that is to say his first minister let him receive the honors he gives him but receive them with fear and trembling let him be proud of the approbation of his absolute lord i appeal to the people as my rightful judges and masters and if they are not inclined to condemn me i fear no arbitrary highflying proceedings from the small courtfaction at buttons but after all i have said of this great man there is no rupture between us we are each of us so civil and obliging that neither thinks he is obliged and i for my part treat with him as we do with the grand monarch who has too many great qualities not to be respected though we know he watches any occasion to oppress us  when i talk of homer i must not forget the early present you made me of monsieur de la mottes book and i cannot conclude this letter without telling you a melancholy piece of news which affects our very entrails  is dead and soupes are no more you see i write in the old familiar way this is not to the minister but to the friend  however it is some mark of uncommon regard to the minister that i steal an expression from a secretary of state  i am etc  mr pope to sir william trumbull dec         it was one of the enigmas of pythagoras when the winds rise worship the echo a modern writer explains this to signify  when popular tumults begin retire to solitudes or such places where echos are commonly found rocks woods etc i am rather of opinion it should be interpreted when rumors increase and when there is abundance of noise and clamor believe the second report this i think agrees more exactly with the echo and is the more natural application of the symbol however it be either of these precepts is extremely proper to be followed at this season and i cannot but applaud your resolution of continuing in what you call your cave in the forest this winter and preferring the noise of breaking ice to that of breaking statesmen the rage of storms to that of parties and fury and ravage of floods and tempests to the precipitancy of some and the ruins of others which i fear will be our daily prospect in london  i sincerely wish myself with you to contemplate the wonders of god in the firmament rather than the madness of men on the earth but i never had so much cause as now to complain of my poetical star that fixes me at this tumultuous time to attend the gingling of rhymes and the measuring of syllables to be almost the only trifler in the nation and as ridiculous as the poet in petronius who while all the rest in the ship were either laboring or praying for life was scratching his head in a little room to write a fine description of the tempest  you tell me you like the sound of no arms but those of achilles for my part i like them as little as the others i listed myself in the battles of homer and i am no sooner in war but like most other folks i wish myself out again  i heartily join with you in wishing quiet to our native country quiet in the state which like charity in religion is too much the perfection and happiness of either to be broken or violated on any pretense or prospect whatsoever fire and sword and fire and faggot are equally my aversion i can pray for opposite parties and for opposite religions with great sincerity i think to be a lover of ones country is a glorious elogy but i do not think it so great an one as to be a lover of mankind  mr j and i sometimes celebrate you under these denominations and join your health with that of the whole world a truly catholic health which far excels the poor narrowspirited ridiculous healths now in fashion to this church or that church whatever our teachers may say they must give us leave at least to wish generously these dear sir are my general dispositions but whenever i pray or wish for particulars you are one of the first in the thoughts and affections of  your etc  sir w trumbulls answer jan           i should be ashamed of my long idleness in not acknowledging your kind advice about echo and your most ingenious explanation of it relating to popular tumults which i own to be very useful and yet give me leave to tell you that i keep myself to a shorter receipt of the same pythagoras which is silence and this i shall observe if not the whole time of his discipline yet at least till your return into this country i am obliged further to this method by the most severe weather i ever felt when though i keep as near by the fire as may be yet gelidus concrevit frigore sanguis and often i apprehend the circulation of the blood begins to be stopped i have further great losses to a poor farmer of my poor oxen  intereunt pecudes slant circumfusa pruinis corpora magna boum etc  pray comfort me if you can by telling me that your second volume of homer is not frozen for it must be expressed very poetically to say now that the presses sweat  i cannot forbear to add a piece of artifice i have been guilty of on occasion of my being obliged to congratulate the birthday of a friend of mine when finding i had no materials of my own i very frankly sent him your imitation of martials epigram on antonius primus jam numerat placido felix antonius aevo etc sir william trumbull was born at easthamsted in berkshire he was fellow of all souls college in oxford followed the study of the civil law and was sent by king charles the second judgeadvocate to tangier thence envoy to florence turin etc and in his way back envoy extraordinary to france from thence sent by king james the second ambassador to the ottoman port afterward he was made lord of the treasury then secretary of state with the duke of shrewsbury which office he resigned in      he retired to easthamsted in windsor forest and died in the place of his nativity in december      aged    bears our author celebrated that retirement in his poem on the forest and addressed to him his first pastoral at    years of age  this has been applauded so much that i am in danger of commencing poet perhaps laureat pray desire my good friend mr row to enter a caveat provided you will further increase my stock in this bank in which proceeding i have laid the foundation of my estate and as honestly as many others have begun theirs but now being a little tender as young beginners often are i offer to you for i have concealed the true author whether you will give me orders to declare who is the father of this fine child or not whatever you determine my fingers pen and ink are so frozen that i cannot thank you more at large you will forgive this and all other faults of dear sir  your etc  to mr jervas in ireland july        though as you rightly remark i pay my tax but once in half a year yet you shall see by this letter upon the neck of my last that i pay a double tax as we nonjurors ought to do your acquaintance on this side the sea are under terrible apprehensions from your long stay in ireland that you may grow too polite for them for we think since the great success of so damned a play as the nonjuror that politeness is gone over the water but others are of opinion it has been longer among you and was introduced much about the same time with frogs and with equal success poor poetry the little that is left of it here longs to cross the seas and leave eusden in full and peaceable possession of the british laurel and we begin to wish you had the singing of our poets as well as the croaking of our frogs to yourselves in saecula saeculorum it would be well in exchange if parnelle and two or three more of your swans would come hither especially that swan who like a true modern one does not sing at all dr swift i am like the rest of the world a sufferer by his idleness indeed i hate that any man should be idle while i must translate and comment and i may the more sincerely wish for good poetry from others because i am become a person out of the question for a translator is no more a poet than a tailor is a man  you are doubtless persuaded of the validity of that famous verse it is expectation makes a blessing dear but why would you make your friends fonder of you than they are there is no manner of need of it  we begin to expect you no more than antichrist a man that has absented himself so long from his friends ought to be put into the gazette  every body here has great need of you many faces have died for ever for want of your pencil and blooming ladies have withered in expecting your return even frank and betty that constant pair cannot console themselves for your absence i fancy they will be forced to make their own picture in a pretty babe before you come home twill be a noble subject for a family piece come then and having peopled ireland with a world of beautiful shadows come to us and see with that eye which like the eye of the world creates beauties by looking on them see i say how england has altered the airs of all its heads in your absence and with what sneaking city artitudes our most celebrated personages appear inthe mere mortal works of our painters  mr fortescue is much yours gay commemorates you and lastly to climb by just steps and degrees my lord burlington desires you may be put in mind of him his gardens flourish his structures rise his pictures arrive and what is far nobler and more valuable than all his own good qualities daily extend themselves to all about him whereof i the meanest next to some italian chemists fiddlers bricklayers and operamakers am a living instance  to the same nov         if i had not done my utmost to lead my life so pleasantly as to forget all misfortunes i should tell you i reckoned your absence no small one but i hope you have also had many good and pleasant reasons to forget your friends on this side the world if a wish could transport me to you and your present companions i could do the same dr swift i believe is a very good landlord and a cheerful host at his own table i suppose he has perfectly learnt himself what he has taught so many others rupta non insanire lagena else he would not make a proper host for your humble servant who you know though he drinks a glass as seldom as any man contrives to break one as often but it is a consolation to me that i can do this and many other enormities under my own roof  but that you and i are upon equal terms of all friendly laziness and haven take an inviolable oath to each other always to do what we will i should reproach you for so long a silence the best amends you can make for saying nothing to me is by saying all the good you can of me which is that i heartily love and esteem the dean and dr parnelle  gay is yours and theirs his spirit is awakened very much in the cause of the dean which has broke forth in a courageous couplet or two upon sir richard bl he has printed it with his name to it and bravely assigns no other reason than that the said sir richard has abused dr swift i have also suffered in the like cause and shall suffer more unless parnelle sends me his zoilus and bookworm which the bishop of clogher i hear greatly extols it will be shortly concurrere bellum atque virum  i love you all as much as i despise most wits in this dull country ireland has turned the tables upon england and if i have no poetical friend in my own nation i will be as proud as scipio and say since i am reduced to skin and bone ingrata patria ne ossa quidem habeas  to the same nov         that you have not heard from me of late ascribe not to the usual laziness of your correspondent but to a ramble to oxford where your name is mentioned with honor even in a land flowing with tories i had the good fortune there to be often in the conversation of doctor clarke he entertained me with several drawings and particularly with the original designs of inigo joness whitehall i there saw and reverenced some of your first pieces which future painters are to look upon as we poets do on the culex of virgil and batrachom of homer  having named this latter piece give me leave to ask what is become of dr parnelle and his frogs oblitusque meorum obliviscendus and illis might be horaces wish but will never be mine while i have such meorums as dr parnelle and dr swift i hope the spring will restore you to us and with you all the beauties and colors of nature not but i congratulate you on the pleasure you must take in being admired in your own country which so seldom happens to prophets and poets but in this you have the advantage of poets you are master of an art that must prosper and grow rich as long as people love or are proud of themselves or their own persons however you have stayed long enough methinks to have painted all the numberless histories of old ogygiae if you have begun to be historical i recommend to your hand the story which every pious irishman ought to begin with that of st patrick to the end you may be obliged as dr p was when he translated the batrachomuomachia to come into england to copy the frogs and such other vermin as were never seen in that land since the time of that confessor  i long to see you a history painter you have already done enough for the private do something for the public and be not confined like the rest to draw only such silly stories as our own faces tell of us the ancients too expect you should do them right those statues from which you learned your beautiful and noble ideas demand it as a piece of gratitude from you to make them truly known to all nations in the account you intend to write of their characters i hope you think more warmly than ever of that noble design  as to your enquiry about your house when i come within the walls they put me in mind of those of carthage where your friend like the wandering trojan animum pictura pascit inani for the spacious mansion like a turkish caravanserah entertains the vagabond with only bare lodging i rule the family very ill keep bad hours and lend out your pictures about the town see what it is to have a poet in your house frank indeed does all he can in such a circumstance for considering he has a wild beast in it he constantly keeps the door chained every time it is opened the links rattle the rusty hinges roar the house seems so sensible that you are its support that it is ready to drop in your absence but i still trust my self under its roof as depending that providence will preserve so many raphaels titian and guidos as are lodged in your cabinet surely the sins of one poet can hardly be so heavy as to bring an old house over the heads of so many painters in a word your house is falling but what of that i am only a lodger  mr secretary craggs to mr pope paris sept        last post brought me the favor of your letter of the  0th aug o s it would be taking too much upon me to decide that twas a witty one i never pretend to more judgment than to know what pleases me and can assure you it was a very agreeable one the proof i can give you of my sincerity in this opinion is that i hope and desire you would not stop at this but continue more of them  i am in a place where pleasure is continually flowing the princes set the example and the subjects follow at a distance the ladies are of all parties by which means the conversation of the men is very much softened and fashioned from those blunt disputes on politics and rough jests we are so guilty of while the freedom of the women takes away all formality and constraint i must own at the same time these beauties are a little too artificial for my taste you have seen a french picture the original is more painted and such a crust of powder and essence in their hair that you can see no difference between black and red by disusing stays and indulging themselves at a table they are run out of all shape but as to that they may give a good reason they prefer convenience to parade and are by this means as ready as they are generally willing to be charitable  i am surpised to find i have wrote so much scandal i fancy i am either setting up for a wit or imagine i must write in this style to a wit i hope you will prove a good natured one and not only let me hear from you sometimes but forgive the small encouragement you meet with if you will complete your favors pray give my humble services to lords wck st and hy i have had my hopes and fears they would have abused me before this time i am sure it is not my business to meddle with a nest of bees i speak only of the honey i will not trouble my self to finish finely a true compliment is better than a good one and i can assure you without any that i am very sincerely  sir yours etc  the revd dean afterward bishop of cloyne in ireland a celebrated metaphysician author of the dialogues of hylas and philonnses the minute philosopher etc berkley to mr pope naples oct    n s      i have long had it in my thoughts to trouble you with a letter but was discouraged for want of something that i could think worth sending fifteen hundred miles italy is such an exhausted subject that i dare say you would easily forgive my saying nothing of it and the imagination of a poet is a thing so nice and delicate that it is no easy matter to find out images capable of giving pleasure to one of the few who in any age have come up to that character i am nevertheless lately returned from an island where i passed three or four months which were it set out in its true colors might methinks amuse you agreeably enough for a minute or two the island inarime is an epitome of the whole earth containing within the compass of eighteen miles a wonderful variety of hills vales ragged rocks fruitful plains and barren mountains all thrown together in a most romantic confusion the air is in the hottest season constantly refreshed by cool breezes from the sea the vales produce excellent wheat and indian corn but are mostly covered with vineyards intermixed with fruit trees besides the common kinds as cherries apricots peaches etc they produce oranges limes almonds pomegranates figs water melons and many other fruits unknown to our climates which lie every where open to the passenger the hills are the greater part covered to the top with vines some with chestnut groves and others with thickets of myrtle and lentiscus the fields on the northern side are divided by hedgerows of myrtle several fountains and rivulets add to the beauty of this landscape which is likewise set off by the variety of some barren spots and naked rocks but that which crowns the scene is a large mountain rising out of the middle of the island once a terrible volcano by the ancients called mons epomeus its lower parts are adorned with vines and other fruits the middle affords pasture to flocks of goats and sheep and the top is a sandy pointed rock from which you have the finest prospect in the world surveying at one view besides several pleasant islands lying at your feet a tract of italy about three hundred miles in length from the promontory of antium to he cape of palinurus the greater part of which has been sung by homer and virgil as making a considerable part of the travels and adventures of their two heroes the islands caprea prochyta and parthenope together with cajeta cumae monte miseno the habitations of circe the sirens and the lestrigones the bay of naples the promontory of minerva and the whole campagnia felice make but a part of this noble landscape which would demand an imagination as warm and numbers as flowing as your own to describe it the inhabitants of this delicious isle as they are without riches and honors so are they without the vices and follies that attend them and were they but as much strangers to revenge as they are to avarice or ambition they might in fact answer the poetical notions of the golden age but they have got as an alloy to their happiness an ill habit of murdering one another on flight offenses we had an instance of this the second night after our arrival a youth of eighteen being shot dead by our door and yet by the sole secret of minding our own business we found a means of living securely among these dangerous people would you know how we pass the time at naples our chief entertainment is the devotion of our neighbors besides the gayety of their churches where folks go to see what they call una bella devotione i e a sort of religious opera they make fireworks almost every week out of devotion the streets are often hung with arras out of devotion and what is still more strange the ladies invite gentlemen to their houses and treat them with music and sweetmeats out of devotion in a word were it not for this devotion of its inhabitants naples would have little else to recommend it beside the air and situation learning is in no very thriving state here as indeed no where else in italy however among many pretenders some men of taste are to be met with a friend of mine told me not long since that being to visit salvini at florence he found him reading your homer he liked the notes extremely and could find no other fault with the version but that he thought it approached too near a paraphrase which shows him not to be sufficiently acquainted with our language i wish you health to go on with that noble work and when you have that i need not wish you success you will do me the justice to believe that whatever relates to your welfare is sincerely wished by  yours etc  portrait of jonathan swift ionat swift  and dean st pat in hib non pareil    mr pope to dec         the old project of a window in the bosom to render the soul of man visible is what every honest friend has manifold reason to wish for yet even that would not do in our case while you are so far separated from me and so long i begin to fear you will die in ireland and that the denunciation will be fulfilled upon you hibernus es and in hiberniam reverteris  i should be apt to think you in sanchos case some duke has made you governor of an island or wet place and you are administering laws to the wild irish but i must own when you talk of building and planting you touch my string and i am as apt to pardon you as the fellow that thought himself jupiter would have pardoned the other madman who called himself his brother neptune alas sir do you know whom you talk to one that had been a poet was degraded to a translator and at last through mere dullness is turned an architect you know martials censure  praeconem facito vel architectum however i have one way left to plan to elevate and to surprise as bays says the next you may expect to hear is that i am in debt  the history of my transplantation and settlement which you desire would require a volume were i to enumerate the many projects difficulties vicissitudes and various fates attending that important part of my life much more should i describe the many draughts elevations profiles perspectives etc of every palace and garden proposed intended and happily raised by the strength of that faculty wherein all great geniuss excel imagination at last the gods and fate have fixed me on the borders of the thames in the districts of richmond and twickenham it is here i have passed an entire year of my life without any fixed abode in london or more than casting a transitory glance for a day or two at most in a month on the pomps of the town it is here i hope to receive you sir returned in triumph from eternizing the ireland of this age for you my structures rise for you my colonades extend their wings for you my groves aspire and roses bloom and to say truth i hope posterity which no doubt will be made acquainted with all these things will look upon it as one of the principal motives of my architecture that it was a mansion prepared to receive you against your own should fall to dust which is destined to be the tomb of poor  and  and the immortal monument of the fidelity of two such servants who have excelled in constancy the very rats of your family  what more can i tell you of my self so much and yet all put together so little that i scarce care or know how to do it but the very reasons that are against putting it upon paper are as strong for telling it you in person and i am uneasy to be so long denied the satisfaction of it  at present i consider you bound in by the irish sea like the ghosts in virgil  tristi palus inamabilis unda alligat and novies styx circumfusa coercet and i cannot express how i long to renew our old intercourse and conversation our morning conferences in bed in the same room our evening walks in the park our amusing voyages on the water our philosophical suppers our lectures our dissertations our gravities our reveries our fooleries our what not  this awakens the memory of some of those who have made a part in all these poor parnelle garth row you justly reprove me for not speaking of the death of the last parnelle was too much in my mind to whose memory i am erecting the best monument i can what he gave me to publish was but a small part of what he left behind him but it was the best and i will not make it worse by enlarging it i would fain know if he be buried at chester or dublin and what care has been or is to be taken for his monument etc yet i have not neglected my devoirs to mr row i am writing this very day his epitaph for westminsterabbey  after these the best natured of men sir samuel garth has left me in the truest concern for his loss his death was very heroical and yet unaffected enough to have made a saint or a philosopher famous but ill tongues and worse hearts have branded even his last moments as wrongfully as they did his life with irreligion you must have heard many tales on this subject but if ever there was a good christian without knowing himself to be so it was dr garth  i am etc  letters of mr wycherley and mr pope from the year   0  to    0 the authors age then sixteen mr pope to mr wycherley december      0  it was certainly a great satisfaction to me to see and converse with a man whom in his writings i had so long known with pleasure but it was a high addition to it to hear you at our very first meeting doing justice to your dead friend mr dryden i was not so happy as to know him virgilium tantum vidi  had i been born early enough i must have known and loved him for i have been assured not only by your self but by mr congreve and sir william trumbul that his personal qualities were as amiable as his poetical notwithstanding the many libellous misrepresentations of them against which the former of these gentlemen has told me he will one day vindicate him he since did so in his dedication to the duke of newcastle prefixed to tonsons duodecimo edition of drydens plays       i suppose those injuries were begun by the violence of party but it is no doubt they were continued by envy at his success and fame and those scriblers who attacked him in his latter times were only like gnats in a summers evening which are never very troublesome but in the finest and most glorious season for his fire like the suns shined clearest toward its setting  you must not therefore imagine that when you told me of my own performances that they were above those critics i was so vain as to believe it and yet i may not be so humble as to think my self quite below their notice for critics as they are birds of prey have ever a natural inclination to carrion and though such poor writers as i are but beggars however no beggar is so poor but he can keep a cur and no author is so beggarly but he can keep a critic so i am sar from thinking the attacks of such people either any honor or dishonor even to me much less to mr dryden i think with you that whatever lesser wits have risen since his death are but like stars appearing when the sun is set that twinkle only in his absence and with the rays they have borrowed from him our wit as you call itis but reflection or imitation therefore scarce to be called ours true wit i believe may be defined justness of thought and a facility of expression or in the midwives phrase a perfect conception with an easy delivery however this is far from a complete definition pray help me to a better as i doubt not you can  i am etc  mr wycherley to mr pope jan      0   i have been so busy of late in correcting and transcribing some of my madrigals for a great man or two who desired to see them that i have with your pardon omitted to return you an answer to your most ingenious letter so scriblers to the public like bankers to the public are profuse in their voluntary loans to it whilst they forget to pay their more private and particular as more just debts to their best and nearest friends however i hope you who have as much goodnature as good sense since they generally are companions will have patience with a debtor who you think has an inclination to pay you his obligations if he had wherewithal ready about him and in the mean time should consider when you have obliged me beyond my present power of returning the favor that a debtor may be an honest man if he but intends to be just when he is able though late but i should be less just to you the more i thought i could make a return to so much profuseness of wit and humanity together which though they seldom accompany each other in other men are in you so equally met i know not in which you most abound but so much for my opinion of you which is that your wit and ingenuity is equaled by nothing but your judgment or modesty which though it be to please my self i must no more offend than i can do either right  therefore i will say no more now of them than that your good wit never forfeited your good judgment but in your partiality to me and mine so that if it were possible for a hardened scribler to be vainer than he is what you write of me would make me more conceited than what i scribble my self yet i must confess i ought to be more humbled by your praise than exalted which commends my little sense with so much more of yours that i am disparaged and disheartened by your commendations who give me an example of your wit in the first part of your letter and a definition of it in the last to make writing well that is like you more difficult to me than ever it was before thus the more great and just your example and definition of wit are the less i am capable to follow them then the best way of showing my judgment after having seen how you write is to leave off writing and the best way to show my friendship to you is to put an end to your trouble and to conclude  your etc  mr popes answer march      0  when i write to you i foresee a long letter and ought to beg your patience beforehand for if it proves the longest it will be of course the worst i have troubled you with yet to express my gratitude at large for your obliging letter is not more my duty than my interest as some people will abundantly thank you for one piece of kindness to put you in mind of bestowing another the more favorable you are to me the more distinctly i see my faults spots and blemishes you know are never so plainly discovered as in the brightest sunshine thus i am mortified by those commendations which were designed to encourage me for praise to a young wit is like rain to a tender flower if it be moderately bestowed it chears and revives but if too lavishly overcharges and depresses him most men in years as they are generally discouragers of youth are like old trees that being past bearing themselves will suffer no young plants to flourish beneath them but as if it were not enough to have outdone all your coaevals in wit you will excel them in goodnature too as for my his pastorals written at    years of age green essays if you find any pleasure in em it must be such as a man naturally takes in observing the first shoots and buddings of a tree which he has raised himself and it is impossible they should be esteemed any otherwise than as we value fruits for being early which nevertheless are the most insipid and the worst of the year in a word i must blame you for treating me with so much compliment which is at best but the smoke of friendship i neither write nor converse with you to gain your praise but your affection be so much my friend as to appear my enemy and tell me my faults if not as a young man at least as an unexperienced writer  i am etc  mr wycherley to mr pope march      0  your letter of the twentyfifth of march i have received which was more welcome to me than any thing could be out of the country though it were ones rent due that day and i can find no fault with it but that it charges me with want of sincerity or justice for giving you your due who should not let your modesty be so unjust to your merit as to reject what is due to it and call that compliment which is so short of your desert that it is rather degrading than exalting you but if compliment be the smoke only of friendship as you say however you must allow there is no smoke but there is some fire and as the sacrifice of incense offered to the gods would not have been half so sweet to others if it had not been for its smoke so friendship like love cannot be without some incense to perfume the name it would praise and immortalize but since you say you do not write to me to gain my praise but my affection pray how is it possible to have the one without the other we must admire besore we love you affirm you would have me so much your friend as to appear your enemy and find out your faults rather than your perfections but my friend that would be so hard to do that i who love no difficulties cannot be persuaded to it besides the vanity of a scribler is such that he will never part with his own judgment to gratify anothers especially when he must take pains to do it and though i am proud to be of your opinion when you talk of any thing or man but your self i cannot suffer you to murder your fame with your own hand without opposing you especially when you say your last letter is the worst since the longest you have favored me with which i therefore think the best as the longest life if a good one is the best as it yields the more variety and is more exemplary as a cheerful summers day though longer than a dull one in the winter is less tedious and more entertaining therefore let but your friendship be like your letter as lasting as it is agreeable and it can never be tedious but more acceptable and obliging to  your etc  mr wycherley to mr pope april     0  i have received yours of the fifth wherein your modesty refuses the just praises i give you by which you lay claim to more as a bishop gains his bishopric by saying he will not episcopate but i must confess whilst i displease you by commending you i please my self just as incense is sweeter to the offerer than the deity to whom it is offered by his being so much above it for indeed every man partakes of the praise he gives when it is so justly given  as to my enquiry after your intrigues with the muses you may allow me to make it since no old man can give so young so great and able a favorite of theirs jealousy i am in my enquiry like old sir bernard gascoign who used to say that when he was grown too old to have his visits admitted alone by the ladies he always took along with him a young man to ensure his welcome to them who had he come alone had been rejected only because his visits were not scandalous to them so i am like an old rook who is ruined by gaming forced to live on the good fortune of the pushing young men whose fancies are so vigorous that they ensure their success in their adventures with the muses by their strength of imagination   your papers are safe in my custody you may be sure from any ones theft but my own for it is as dangerous to trust a scribler with your wit as a gamester with the custody of your money  if you happen to come to town you will make it more difficult for me to leave it who am dear mr pope  your etc  mr popes answer april  0   0  i cannot contend with you you must give me leave at once to wave all your compliments and to collect only this in general from em that your design is to encourage me but i separate from all the rest that paragraph or two in which you make me so warm an offer of your friendship were i possessed of that it would put an end to all those speeches with which you now make me blush and change them to wholesome advices and free sentiments which might make me wiser and happier i know it is the general opinion that friendship is best contracted betwixt persons of equal age but i have so much interest to be of another mind that you must pardon me if i cannot forbear telling you a few notions of mine in opposition to that opinion  in the first place it is observable that the love we bear to our friends is generally caused by our finding the same dispositions in them which we feel in our selves this is but selflove at the bottom whereas the affection betwixt people of different ages cannot well be such the inclinations of such being commonly various the friendship of two young men is often occasioned by love of pleasure or voluptuousness each being desirous for his own sake of one to assist or encourage him in the courses he pursues as that of two old men is frequently on the score of some profit lucre or design upon others now as a young man who is less acquainted with the ways of the world has in all probability less of interest and an old man who may be weary of himself less of selflove so the friendship between them is the more likely to be true and unmixed with too much selfregard one may add to this that such a friendship is of greater use and advantage to both for the old man will grow more gay and agreeable to please the young one and the young man more discreet and prudent by the help of the old one so it may prove a cure of those epidemical diseases of age and youth sourness and madness i hope you will not need many arguments to convince you of the possibility of this one alone abundantly satisfies me and convinces to the very heart which is that i am etc mr wycherley was at this time about seventy years old mr pope under seventeen   mr pope to mr wycherley june      0  i should believe my self happy in your good opinion but that you treat me so much in a style of compliment it has been observed of women that they are more subject in their youth to be touched with vanity than men on account of their being generally treated this way but the weakest women are not more so than that weak class of men who are thought to pique themselves upon their wit the world is never wanting when a coxcomb is accomplishing himself to help to give him the finishing stroke  every man is apt to think his neighbor overstockd with vanity yet i cannot but fancy there are certain times when most people are in a disposition of being informed and it is incredible what a vast good a little truth might do spoken in such seasons a very small alms will do a great kindness to people in extreme necessity  i could name an acquaintance of yours who would at this time think himself more obliged to you for the information of his faults than the confirmation of his follies if you would make those the subject of a letter it might be as long as i could wish your letters always were  i do not wonder you have hitherto found some difficulty as you are pleased to say in writing to me since you have always chosen the task of commending me take but the other way and i dare engage you will find none at all  as for my verses which you praise so much i may truly say they had never been the cause of any vanity in me except what they gave me when they first occasioned my acquaintance with you but i have several times since been in danger of this vice as often i mean as i received any letters from you  it is certain the greatest magnifying glasses in the world are a mans own eyes when they look upon his own person yet even in those i cannot fancy my self so extremely like alexander the great as you would persuade me if i must be like him it is you will make me so by complimenting me into a better opinion of my self than i deserve they made him think he was the son of jupiter and you assure me i am a man of parts but is this all you can say to my honor you said ten times as much before when you called me your friend after having made me believe i possessed a share in your affection to treat me with compliments and sweet sayings is like the proceeding with poor sancho panca they had persuaded him that he enjoyed a great dominion and then gave him nothing to subsist upon but wafers and marmalade in our days the greatest obligation you can lay upon a wit is to make a fool of him for as when madmen are found incurable wise men give them their way and please them as well as they can so when those incorrigible things poets are once irrecoverably bemusd the best way both to quiet them and secure your selves from the effects of their frenzy is to feed their vanity which indeed for the most part is all that is fed in a poet  you may believe me i could be heartily glad that all you say were as true applied to me as it would be to your self for several weighty reasons but for none so much as that i might be to you what you deserve whereas i can now be no more than is consistent with the small though utmost capacity of  dear sir your ever affectionate servant  mr pope to mr wycherley oct      0  i have now changed the scene from the town to the country from wills coffeehouse to windsor forest i find no other difference than this betwixt the common townwits and the downright country fools that the first are pertly in the wrong with a little more flourish and gaiety and the last neither in the right nor the wrong but confirmed in a stupid settled medium betwixt both however methinks these are most in the right who quietly and easily resign themselves over to the gentle reign of dullness which the wits must do at last though after a great deal of noise pother and resistance ours are a sort of modest inoffensive people who neither have sense nor pretend to any but enjoy a jovial sort of dullness they are commonly known in the world by the name of honest civil gentlemen they live much as they ride at random a kind of hunting life pursuing with earnestness and hazard something not worth the catching never in the way nor out of it i cannot but preser solitude to the company of all these for though a mans self may possibly be the worst fellow to converse with in the world yet one would think the company of a person whom we have the greatest regard to and affection for could not be very unpleasant as a man in love with a mistress desires no conversation but hers so a man in love with himself as most men are may be best pleased with his own besides if the truest and most useful knowledge be the knowledge of our selves solitude conducing most to make us look into our selves should be the most instructive state of life we see nothing more commonly than men who for the sake of the circumstantial part and mere outside of life have been half their days rambling out of their nature and ought to be sent into solitude to study themselves over again people are usually spoiled instead of being taught at their coming into the world whereas by being more conversant with obseurity without any pains they would naturally follow what they were meant for in a word if a man be a coxcomb solitude is his best school and if he be a fool it is his best sanctuary  these are good reasons for my own stay here but i wish i could give you any for your coming hither except that i earnestly invite you and yet i cannot help saying i have suffered a great deal of discontent that you do not though i so little merit that you should  i must complain of the shortness of your last those who have most wit like those who have most money are generally most sparing of either  mr wycherleys answer nov     0  yours of the   th of october i have received as i have always done yours with no little satisfaction and am proud to discover by it that you find fault with the shortness of mine which i think the best excuse for it and though they as you say who have most wit or money are most sparing of either there are some who appear poor to be thought rich and are poor which is my case i cannot but rejoice that you have undergone so much discontent for want of my company but if you have a mind to punish me for my fault which i could not help defer your coming to town and you will do it effectually but i know your charity always exceeds your revenge so that i will not despair of seeing you who in return to your inviting me to your forest invite you to my forest the town where the beasts that inhabit tame or wild of long ears or horns pursue one another either out of love or hatred you may have the pleasure to see one pack of bloodhounds pursue another herd of brutes to bring each other to their fall which is their whole sport or if you affect a less bloody chase you may see a pack of spaniels called lovers in a hot pursuit of a two legged vixen who only flies the whole lowed pack to be singled out by one dog who runs mute to catch her up the sooner from the rest as they are making a noise to the loss of their game in fine this is the time for all sorts of sport in the town when those of the country cease therefore leave your forest of beasts for ours of brutes called men who now in full cry packed by the court or country run down in the house of commons a deserted horned beast of the court to the satisfaction of their spectators besides more for your diversion you may see not only the two great play houses of the nation those of the lords and commons in dispute with one another but the two other play houses in high contest because the members of one house are removed up to the other as it is often done by the court for reasons of state insomuch that the lower houses i mean the play houses are going to act tragedies on one another without doors and the sovereign is put to it as it often happens in the other two houses to silence one or both to keep peace between them now i have told you all the news of the town  i am etc  mr wycherley to mr pope feb     0   i have received your kind letter with my paper the same which was printed in the year      in a miscellany of bern lintots and in the present edition of the posthumous works of mr wycherley to mr dryden corrected i own you have made more of it by making it less as the dutch are said to burn half the spices they bring home to inhance the price of the remainder so to be greater gainers by their loss which is indeed my case now well you have pruned my sading laurels of some superfluous sapless and dead branches to make the remainder live the longer thus like your master apollo you are at once a poet and a physician  now sir as to my impudent invitation of you to the town your goodnature was the first cause of my confident request but excuse me i must i see say no more upon this subject since i find you a little too nice to be dealt freely with though you have given me some encouragement to hope our friendship though young might be without shyness or criminal modesty for a friend like a mistress though he is not to be mercenary to be true yet ought not to refuse a friends kindness because it is small or trivial i have told you i think that a spanish lady said to her poor poetical gallant that a queen if she lay with a groom would expect a mark of his kindness from him though it were but his currycomb but you and i will dispute this matter when i am so happy as to see you here and perhaps it is the only dispute in which i might hope to have the better of you  now sir to make you another excuse for my boldness in inviting you to town i designed to leave with you some more of my papers since these return so much better out of your hands than they went from mine for i intended as i told you formerly to spend a month or six weeks this summer near you in the country for you may be assured there is nothing i desire so much as an improvement of your friendship   mr wycherley to mr pope march      0   i must lay a penance upon you which is to desire you to look over that damned miscellany of madrigals of mine to pick out if possible some that may be so altered that they may yet appear in print again i hope with better success than they hitherto have done i will give you my reason for this request of mine when i see you which i am resolved shall be when i have done here and at the bath where i design to go and afterward to spend two months god willing with you at binfield or near it   mr popes answer april  0      by yours of the last month you desire me to select if possible some things from the printed in folio in the year   0  first volume of your miscellanies which may be altered so as to appear again i doubted your meaning in this whether it was to pick out the best of those verses as that on the idleness of business on ignorance on laziness etc to make the method and numbers exact and avoid repetitions for though upon reading em on this occasion i believe they might receive such an alteration with advantage yet they would not be changed so much but any one would know em for the same at first sight or if you mean to improve the worst pieces which are such as to render them very good would require a great addition and almost the entire new writing of them or lastly if you mean the middle sort as the songs and loveverses for these will need only to be shortened to omit repetition the words remaining very little different from what they were before pray let me know your mind in this for i am utterly at a loss yet i have tried what i could do to some of the songs vid letter of nov  0   0  a and the poems on laziness and ignorance but cannot even in my own partial judgment think my alterations much to the purpose so that i must needs desire you would apply your gare wholly at present to those which are yet unpublished of which there are more than enough to make a consierable volume of full as good ones nay i verily believe of better than any in vol i which i could wish you would defer at least till you have finished these that are yet unprinted  i send you a sample of some few of these namely the verses to mr waller in his old age your new ones on the duke of marlborough and two others i have done all that i thought could be of advantage to them some i have contracted as we do sunbeams to improve their energy and force some i have taken quite away as we take branches from a tree to add to the fruit others i have entirely new expressed and turned more into poetry done like one of his successors had infinitely more wit than he wanted versification for the great dealers in wit like those in trade take least pains to set off their goods while the haberdashers of small wit spare for no decorations or ornaments you have commissioned me to paint your shop and i have done my best to brush you up like your neighbors but i can no more pretend to the merit of the production than a midwife to the virtues and good qualities of the child she helps into the light  the few things i have entirely added you will excuse you may take them lawfully for your own because they are no more than sparks lighted up by your fire and you may omit them at last if you think them but squibs in your triumphs  i am etc  mr wycherley to mr pope feb      0   i have received yours of the   th as kind as it is ingenious for which therefore i most heartily thank you it would have been much more welcome to me had it not informed me of your want of health but you who have a mind so vigorous may well be contented with its crazy habitation since you know the old similitude says the keenness of the mind soonest wears out the body as the sharpest sword soonest destroys the scabbard so that as i say you must be satisfied with your apprehension of an uneasy life though i hope not a short one notwithstanding that generally you sound wits though weak bodies are immortal hereafter by that genius which shortens your present life to prolong that of the future but i yet hope your great vigorous and active mind will not be able to destroy your little tender and crazy carcass  now to say something to what you write concerning the present epidemick distemper of the mind and age calumny i know it is no more to be avoided at one time or another of our lives than a fever or an ague and as often those distempers attend or threaten the best constitutions from the worst air so does that malignant air of calumny soonest attack the sound and elevated in mind as storms of wind the tallest and most fruitful trees whilst the low and weak for bowing and moving to and fro are by their weakness secure from the danger and violence of the tempest but so much for stinking rumor which weakest minds are most afraid of as irishmen though the nastiest of mankind are most offended at a fart  mr wycherley to mr pope nov      0  i received yours of the  th yesterday which has like the rest of your letters at once pleased and instructed me so that i assure you you can no more write too much to your absent friends than speak too much to the present this is a truth that all men own who have either seen your writings or heard your discourse enough to make others show their judgment in ceasing to write or talk especially to you or in your company however i speak or write to you not to please you but my self since i provoke your answers which whilst they humble me give me vanity though i am lessened by you even when you commend me since you commend my little sense with so much more of yours that you put me out of countenance whilst you would keep me in it so that you have found a way against the custom of great wits to show even a great deal of goodnature with a great deal of good sense  i thank you for the book you promised me by which i find you would not only correct my lines but my life  as to the damned verses i entrusted you with i hope you will let them undergo your purgatory to save them from other peoples damning them since the critics who are generally the first damned in this life like the damned below never leave to bring those above them under their own circumstances i beg you to peruse my papers and select what you think best or most tolerable and look over them again for i resolve suddenly to print some of them as a hardened old gamester will in spite of all former ill usage by fortune push on an ill hand in expectation of recovering himself especially since i have such a croupier or second to stand by me as mr pope  mr pope to mr wycherley nov  0   0  mr englefyld being upon his journey to london tells me i must write to you by him which i do not more to comply with his desire than to gratify my own though i did it so lately by the messenger you sent hither i take it too as an opportunity of sending you the fair copy of the poem the original of it in blots and with figures of the references from copy to copy in mr popes hand is in the harleylibrary among other such brouillons of mr wycherleys poems corrected by him vid let ap  0   0   note a on dullness which was not then finished and which i should not care to hazard by the common post mr englefyld is ignorant of the contents and i hope your prudence will let him remain so for my sake no less than your own since if you should reveal any thing of this nature it would be no wonder reports should be raised and there are those i fear who would be ready to improve them to my disadvantage i am sorry you told the great man whom you met in the court of requests that your papers were in my hands no man alive shall ever know any such thing from me and i give you this warning besides that though your self should say i had any way assisted you i am notwithstanding resolved to deny it  the method of the copy i send you is very different from what it was and much more regular for the better help of your memory i desire you to compare it by the figures in the margin answering to the same in this letter the poem is now divided into four parts marked with the literal figures i ii iii iv the first contains the praise of dullness and shows how upon several suppositions it passes for   religion   philosophy   example   wit and   the cause of wit and the end of it the second part contains the advantages of dullness  st in business and  dly at court where the similitudes of the bias of a bowl and the weights of a clock are directly tending to illustrate those advantages of dullness though introduced before in a place where there was no mention made of them which was your only objection to my adding them the third contains the happiness of dullness in all stations and shows in a great many particulars that it is so fortunate as to be esteemed some good quality or other in all sorts of people that it is thought quiet sense caution policy prudence majesty valor circumspection honesty etc the fourth part i have wholly added as a climax which sums up all the praise advantage and happiness of dullness in a few words and strengthens them all by the opposition of the disgrace disadvantage and unhappiness of wit with which it concludes this is totally omitted in the present edition some of the lines in the h m are these thus dullness the safe opiate of the mind the last kind refuge weary wit can find fit for all stations and in each content is satisfied secure and innocent no pains it takes and no offense it gives unfeard unhated undisturbed it lives etc    though the whole be as short again as at first there is not one thought omitted but what is a repetition of something in your first volume or in this very paper some thoughts are contracted where they seemed encompassed with too many words and some new expressed or added where i thought there wanted heightning as you will see particularly in the simile of the clockweights it was originally thus expressed as clocks run fastest when most lead is on we find it so in a letter of mr pope to mr wycherley dated april     0  and in a paper of verses of his to the author of a poem called successio which got out in a miscellany in      three years before mr wycherley died and two after he had laid aside the whole design of publishing any poems and the versification throughout is i believe such as no body can be shocked at the repeated permissions you give me of dealing freely with you will i hope excuse what i have done for if i have not spared you when i thought severity would do you a kindness i have not mangled you where i thought there was no absolute need of amputation as to particulars i can satisfy you better when we meet in the mean time pray write to me when you can you cannot too often  mr wycherleys answer nov      0  you may see by my style i had the happiness and satisfaction to receive yesterday by the hands of that wagg mr englefyld your extreme kind and obliging letter of the  0th of this month which like all the rest of yours did at once mortify me and make me vain since it tells me with so much more wit sense and kindness than mine can express that my letters are always welcome to you so that even whilst your kindness invites me to write to you your wit and judgment forbids me since i may return you a letter but never an answer  now as for my owning your assistance to me in overlooking my unmusical numbers and harsher sense and correcting them both with your genius or judgment i must tell you i always own it in spite of your unpoetick modesty who would do with your friendship as your charity conceal your bounty to magnify the obligation and even whilst you lay on your friend the favor acquit him of the debt but that shall not serve your turn i will always own it is my infallible pope has or would redeem me from a poetical damning the second time and save my rhimes from being condemned to the critics flames to all eternity but by the faith you prosess you know your works of supererrogation transferred upon an humble acknowledging sinner may save even him having good works enough of your own besides to ensure yours and their immortality  and now for the pains you have taken to recommend my dullness by making it more methodical i give you a thousand thanks since true and natural dullness is shown more by its pretense to form and method as the sprightliness of wit by its despising both i thank you a thousand times for your repeated invitations to come to binfield  you will find it will be as hard for you to get quit of my mercenary kindness to you as it would for me to deserve or return yours however it shall be the endeavor of my future life as it will be to demonstrate my self  your etc  mr popes reply nov      0  the compliments you make me in regard of any inconsiderable service i could do you are very unkind and do but tell me in other words that my friend has so mean an opinion of me as to think i expect acknowledgments for trifles which upon my faith i shall equally take amiss whether made to my self or to any others for gods sake my dear friend wycherley think better of me and believe i desire no sort of favor so much as that of serving you more considerably than i have yet been able to do  i shall proceed in this manner with some others of your pieces but since you desire i would not deface your copy for the future and only mark the repetitions i must as soon as i have marked these transcribe what is left on another paper and in that blot alter and add all i can devise for their improvement for you are sensible the omission of repetitions is but one and the easiest part of yours and my design there remaining besides to rectify the method to connect the matter and to mend the expression and versification i will go next upon the some brouillons of these transcribed and very much blotted by mr pope are extant in the harley library poems of solitude on the public and on the mixed life the bill of fare the praises of avarice and some others  i must take some notice of what you say of my pains to make your dullness methodical and of your hint that the sprightliness of wit despises method this is true enough if by wit you mean no more than fancy or conceit but in the better notion of wit considered as propriety surely method is not only necessary for perspicuity and harmony of parts but gives beauty even to the minute and particular thoughts which receive an additional advantage from those which precede or follow in their due place according to a simile mr dryden used in conversation of feathers in the crowns of the wild indians which they not only choose for the beauty of their colors but place them in such a manner as to reflect a luster on each other i will not disguise any of my sentiments from you to methodize in your case is full as necessary as to strike out otherwise you had better destroy the whole frame and reduce them into single thoughts in prose like rochfoucault as i have more than once hinted to you  mr wycherley to mr pope feb      0   i have had yours of the   d of this instant for which i give you many thanks since i find by it that even absence the usual bane of love or friendship cannot lessen yours to more than mine mr pope had this from mr cromwell after his enquiry in these words i returned to town last saturday and inquiring as you desired about mr wycherley was told in two several places that he had been very ill and that he was even gone off our stage but i could not imagine this report to be true or that so great a man could leave the world without its being instructed to lament so considerable a loss as to your hearing of my being ill i am glad and sorry for the report in the first place glad that it was not true and in the next sorry that it should give you any disturbance or concern more than ordinary for me for which as well as your concern for my future wellbeing or life i think my self most eternally obliged to you assuring your concern for either will make me more careful of both yet for your sake i love this life so well that i shall the less think of the other but it is in your power to ensure my happiness in one and the other both by your society and good example so not only contribute to my felicity here but hereaster  now as to your excuse for the plainness of your style or letter i must needs tell you that friendship is much more acceptable to a true friend than wit which is generally salse reasoning and a friends reprimand often shows more friendship than his compliment nay love which is more than friendship is often seen by our friends correction of our follies or crimes upon this test of your friendship i intend to put you when i return to london and thence to you at binfield which i hope will be within a month  next to the news of your good health i am pleased with the good news of your going to print some of your poems and proud to be known by them to the public for your friend who intend perhaps the same way to be revenged of you for your kindness by taking your name in vain in some of my future madrigals yet so as to let the world know my love or esteem for you are no more poetic than my talent in scribbling but of all the arts of fiction i desire you to believe i want that of feigning friendship and that i am sincerely  your etc  mr wycherley to mr pope may      0  i have received yours of the first of may your pastoral muse outshines in her modest and natural dress all apollos courtladies in their more artful labored and costly finery therefore i am glad to find by your letter you design your countrybeauty of a muse shall appear at court and in public to outshine all the farded lewd confident affected towndowdies who aim at being honored only to their shame but her artful innocence on the contrary will gain more honor as she becomes more public and in spite of custom will bring modesty again into fashion or at least make her sisterrivals of this age blush for spite if not for shame as for my stale antiquated poetical puss whom you would keep in countenance by saying she has once been tolerable and would yet pass muster by a little licking over it is true that like most vain antiquated jades which have once been passable yet she affects youthfulness in her age and would still gain a few admirers who the more she seeks or labors for their liking are but more her contemners nevertheless she is resolved henceforth to be so cautious as to appear very little more in the world except it be as an attendant on your muse or as a foil not a rival to her wit or fame so that let your countrygentlewoman appear when she will in the world this and the following extract are a full confutation of the lying spirit of john dennis and others who impudently asserted that mr pope wrote these verses on himself though published by mr wycherley six years before his death we find here it was a voluntary act of his promised beforehand and written while mr pope was absent the first brouillon of those verses and the second copy with corrections are both yet extant in the harley library in mr wycherleys own hand from which will appear that if they received any alteration from mr pope it was in the omission of some of his own praises  my old wornout jade of a lost reputation shall be her attendant into it to procure her admirers as an old whore who can get no more friends of her own bawds for others to make sport or pleasure yet one way or other for mankind i approve of your making tonson your muses introductor into the world or master of the ceremonies who has been so long a pimp or gentleman usher to the muses  i wish you good fortune since a man with store of wit as store of money without the help of good fortune will never be popular but i wish you a great many admirers which will be some credit to my judgment as well as your wit who always thought you had a great deal and am  your etc  extract from two letters of mr wycherley of may    and of july      0  i have made a damned compliment in verse upon the printing your pastorals which you shall see when you see me  if you suffer my old dowdy of a muse to wait upon your sprightly lass of the plains into the company of the town twill be but like an old citybawds attending a young country beauty to town to gain her admirers when past the hopes of pleasing the world herself  mr wycherley to mr pope may      0  i must thank you for a book of your miscellanies which tonson sent me i suppose by your order and all i can tell you of it is that nothing has lately been better received by the public than your part of it you have only displeased the critics by pleasing them too well having not left them a word to say for themselves against you and your performances so that now your hand is in you must persevere till my prophesies of you be fulfilled in earnest all the best judges of good sense or poetry are admirers of yours and like your part of the book so well that the rest is liked the worse this is true upon my word without compliment so that your first success will make you for all your life a poet in spite of your wit for a poets success at first like a gamesters fortune at first is like to make him a loser at last and to be undone by his good fortune and merit  but hitherto your miscellanies have safely run the gantlet through all the coffeehouses which are now entertained with a whimsical new newspaper called the tatler which i suppose you have seen this is the newest thing i can tell you of except it be of the peace which now most people say is drawing to such a conclusion as all europe is or must be satisfied with so poverty you see which makes peace in westminster hall makes it likewise in the camp or field throughout the world peace then be to you and to me who am now grown peaceful and will have no contest with any man but him who says he is more your friend or humble servant than  your etc  mr popes answer may  0   0  i am glad you received the jacob tonsons sixth vol of miscellany poems miscellany if it were only to show you that there are as bad poets in this nation as your servant this modern custom of appearing in miscellanies is very useful to the poets who like other thieves escape by getting into a crowd and herd together like banditti safe only in their multitude methinks strada has given a good description of these kind of collections nullus hodie mortalium aut nascitur aut moritur aut praeliatur aut rusticatur aut abit peregre aut redit aut nubit aut est aut non est nam etiammortuis isti canunt cui non illi extemplo cudant epicaedia genethliaca protreptica panegyrica epithalamia vaticinia propemptica soterica paraenetica naenias nugas as to the success which you say my part has met with it is to be attributed to what you were pleased to say of me to the world which you do well to call your prophesy since whatever is said in my favor must be a prediction of things that are not yet you like a true godfather engage on my part for much more than ever i can perform my pastoral muse like other country girls is but put out of countenance by what you courtiers say to her yet i hope you would not deceive me too far as knowing that a young scriblers vanity needs no recruits from abroad for nature like an indulgent mother kindly takes care to supply her sons with as much of their own as is necessary for their satisfaction if my verses should meet with a few flying commendations virgil has taught me that a young author has not too much reason to be pleased with them when he considers that the natural consequence of praise is envy and calumny  si ultra placitum laudarit baccare frontent cingite ne vati noceat mala lingua futuro when once a man has appeared as a poet he may give up his pretensions to all the rich and thriving arts those who have once made their court to those mistresses without portions the muses are never like to set up for fortunes but for my part i shall be satisfied if i can lose my time agreeably this way without losing my reputation as for gaining any i am as indifferent in the matter as falstaff was and may say of fame as he did of honor if it comes it comes unlooked for and there is an end on it i can be content with a bare saving game without being thought an eminent hand with which title jacob has graciously dignified his adventurers and volunteers in poetry jacob creates poets as kings sometimes do knights not for their honor but for money certainly he ought to be esteemed a worker of miracles who is grown rich by poetry  what authors lose their booksellers have won so pimps grow rich while gallants are undone i am your etc  mr wycherley to mr pope may      0  the last i received from you was dated the   d of may i take your charitable hint to me very kindly wherein you do like a true friend and a true christian and i shall endeavor to follow your advice as well as your example  as for your wishing to see your friend an hermit with you i cannot be said to leave the world since i shall enjoy in your conversation all that i can desire of it nay can learn more from you alone than from my long experience of the great or little vulgar in it  as to the success of your poems in the late miscellany i told you of in my last upon my word i made you no compliment for you may be assured that all sorts of readers like them except they are writers too but for them i must needs say the more they like them they ought to be the less pleased with em so that you do not come off with a bare saving game as you call it but have gained so much credit at first that you must needs support it to the last since you set up with so great a stock of good sense judgment and wit that your judgment ensures all that your wit ventures at the salt of your wit has been enough to give a relish to the whole insipid hotchpotch it is mingled the sixth volume of tonsons miscellanies with and you will make jacobs ladder raise you to immortality by which others are turned off shamefully to their damnation for poetic thieves as they are who think to be saved by others good works how faulty soever their own are but the coffeehouse wits or rather antiwits the critics prove their judgments by approving your wit and even the newsmongers and poets will own you have more invention than they nay the detracters or the envious who never speak well of any body not even of those they think well of in their absence yet will give you even in your absence their good word and the critics only hate you for being forced to speak well of you whether they will or no and all this is true upon the word of  your etc  mr wycherley to mr pope aug      0  my letters so much inferior to yours can only make up their scarcity of sense by their number of lines which is like the spaniards paying a debt of gold with a load of brass money but to be a plaindealer i must tell you i will revenge the raillery of your letters upon mine by printing them as dennis did mine without your knowledge too which would be a revenge upon your judgment for the raillery of your wit for some dull rogues that is the most in the world might be such fools as to think what you said of me was in earnest it is not the first time you great wits have gained reputation by their paradoxical or ironical praises your forefathers have done it erasmus and others  for all mankind who know me must confess he must be no ordinary genius or little friend who can find out any thing to commend in me seriously who have given no sign of my judgment but my opinion of yours nor mark of my wit but my leaving off writing to the public now you are beginning to show the world what you can do by yours whose wit is as spiritual as your judgment infallible in whose judgment i have an implicit faith and shall always subscribe to it to save my works in this world from the flames and damnation  pray present my most humble service to sir w trumbull for whom and whose judgment i have so profound a respect that his example had almost made me marry more than my nephews ill carriage to me having once resolved to have revenged my self upon him by my marriage but now am resolved to make my revenge greater upon him by his marriage  mr wycherley to mr pope april      0 i have had yours of the  0th of the last month which is kinder than i desire it should be since it tells me you could be better pleased to be sick again in town in my company than to be well in the country without it and that you are more impatient to be deprived of happiness than of health yet my dear friend set raillery or compliment aside i can bear your absence which procures your health and ease better than i can your company when you are in pain for i cannot see you so without being so too your love to the country i do not doubt nor do you i hope my love to it or you since there i can enjoy your company without seeing you in pain to give me satisfaction and pleasure there i can have you without rivals or disturbers without the cs too civil or the ts too rude without the noise of the loud and the censure of the silent and would rather have you abuse me there with the truth than at this distance with your compliment since now your business of a friend and kindness to a friend is by finding fault with his faults and mending them by your obliging severity i hope in point of your good nature you will have no cruel charity for those papers of mine you were so willing to be troubled with which i take most infinitely kind of you and shall acknowledge with gratitude as long as i live no friend can do more for his friend than preserving his reputation nay not by preserving his life since by preserving his life he can only make him live about threescore or fourscore years but by preserving his reputation he can make him live as long as the world lasts so save him from damning when he is gone to the devil therefore i pray condemn me in private as the thieves do their accomplices in newgate to save them from condemnation by the public be most kindly unmerciful to my poetical faults and do with my papers as you countrygentlemen do with your trees slash cut and lopoff the excrescencies and dead parts of my withered bays that the little remainder may live the longer and increase the value of them by diminishing the number i have troubled you with my papers rather to give you pain than pleasure notwithstanding your compliment which says you take the trouble kindly such is the generosity to your friends that you take it kindly to be desired by them to do them a kindness and you think it done to you when they give you an opportunity to do it to them wherefore you may be sure to be troubled with my letters out of interest if not kindness since mine to you will procure yours to me so that i write to you more for my own sake than yours less to make you think i write well than to learn from you to write better thus you see interest in my kindness which is like the friendship of the world rather to make a friend than be a friend but i am yours as a true plaindealer  mr wycherley to mr pope april       0 if i can but do part of my business at shrewsbury in a fortnights time which i propose to do i will be soon after with you and trouble you with my company for the remainder of the summer in the mean time i beg you to give your self the pains of altering or leaving out what you think superfluous in my papers that i may endeavor to print such a number of them as you and i shall think fit about michaelmas next in order to which my dear friend i beg you to be so kind to me as to be severe to them that the critics may be less so for i had rather be condemned by my friend in private than exposed to my foes in public the critics or common judges who are made such by having been old offenders themselves pray believe i have as much faith in your friendship and sincerity as i have deference to your judgment and as the best mark of a friend is telling his friend his faults in private so the next is concealing them from the public till they are fit to appear in the mean time i am not a little sensible of the great kindness you do me in the trouble you take for me in putting my rhymes in tune since good sounds set off often ill sense as the italian songs whose good airs with the worst words or meaning make the best music so by your tuning my welsh harp my rough sense may be the less offensive to the nicer ears of those critics who deal more in sound than sense pray then take pity at once both of my readers and me in shortning my barren abundance and increasing their patience by it as well as the obligations i have to you and since no madrigaller can entertain the head unless he pleases the ear and since the crowded operas have left the best comedies with the least audiences it is a sign sound can prevail over sense therefore soften my words and strengthen my sense and  eris mihi magnus apollo  mr wycherley  mr wycherley to mr pope april       0 you give me an account in your letter of the trouble you have undergone for me in comparing my papers you took down with you with the old printed volume and with one another of that bundle you have in your hands amongst which you say you find numerous the truth of this may be seen in the whole printed volume of his miscellanies in folio in   0  in almost every page repetitions of the same thoughts and subjects all which i must confess my want of memory has prevented me from imagining as well as made me capable of committing them since of all figures that of tautology is the last i would use or least forgive my self for but seeing is believing wherefore i will take some pains to examine and compare those papers in your hands with one another as well as with the former printed copies or books of my damned miscellanies all which as bad a memory as i have with a little more pains and care i think i can remedy therefore i would not have you give your self more trouble about them which may prevent the pleasure you have and may give the world in writing upon new subjects of your own whereby you will much better entertain your self and others now as to your remarks upon the whole volume of my papers all that i desire of you is to mark in the margin without defacing the copy at all either any repetition of words matter or sense or any thoughts or words too much repeated which if you will be so kind as to do for me you will supply my want of memory with your good one and my deficiencies of sense with the infallibility of yours which if you do you will most infinitely oblige me who almost repent the trouble i have given you since so much now as to what you call freedom with me which you desire me to forgive you may be assured i would not forgive you unless you did use it for i am so far from thinking your plainness a fault or an offense to me that i think it a charity and an obligation which i shall always acknowledge with all sort of gratitude to you for it who am therefore  dear mr pope your most obliged humble servant w wycherley all the news i have to send you is that poor mr betterton is going to make his exit from the stage of this world the gout being gotten up into his head and as the physicians say will certainly carry him off suddenly    mr popes answer may      0 i am sorry you persist to take ill my not accepting your invitation and to find if i mistake not your exception not unmixt with some suspicion be certain i shall most carefully observe your request not to cross over or deface the copy of your papers for the future and only to mark in the margin the repetitions but as this can serve no further than to get rid of those repetitions and no way rectify the method nor connect the matter nor improve the poetry in expression or numbers without further blotting adding and altering so it really is my opinion and desire that you should take your papers out of my hands into your own and that no alterations may be made but when both of us are present when you may be satisfied with every blot as well as every addition and nothing be put upon the papers but what you shall give your own sanction and assent to at the same time  do not be so unjust as to imagine from hence that i would decline any part of this task on the contrary you know i have been at the pains of transcribing some pieces at once to comply with your desire of not defacing the copy and yet to lose no time in proceeding upon the correction i will go on the same way if you please though truly it is as i have often told you my sincere opinion that the greater part would make a much better figure as single maxims and reflections in prose after the manner of your favorite rochefoucant than in verse but little progress was made in this design by mr wycherley through his old age and the increase of his infirmities he died      and was buried in the vault of st pauls church covent garden and this when nothing more is done but marking the repetitions in the margin will be an easy task for your self to proceed upon notwithstanding the bad memory you complain of  i am unfeignedly dear sir your etc  letters of of abberley in worcestershire gentleman of the horse in queen annes reign author of several beautiful pieces in prose and verse and in the opinion of mr dryden in his postscript to virgil the best critic of our nation in his time mr walsh and mr pope from   0  to   0  mr walsh to mr wycherley ap  0   0  i return you the mr popes pastorals papers you favored me with and had sent them to you yesterday morning but that i thought to have brought them to you last night my self i have read them over several times with great satisfaction the preface is very judicious and very learned and the verses very tender and easy the author seems to have a particular genius for that kind of poetry and a judgment that much exceeds the years you told me he was of he has taken very freely from the ancients but what he has mixed of his own with theirs is no way inferior to what he has taken from them it is no flattery at all to say that virgil had written nothing so good at his age sixteen  i shall take it as a favor if you will bring me acquainted with him and if he will give himself the trouble any morning to call at my house i shall be very glad to read the verses over with him and give him my opinion of the particulars more largely than i can well do in this letter i am sir  your most faithful and most humble servant w walsh  mr walsh to mr pope june      0  i received the favor of your letter and shall be very glad of the continuance of a correspondence by which i am like to be so great a gainer i hope when i have the happiness of seeing you again in london not only to read over the verses i have now of yours but more that you have written since for i make no doubt but any one who writes so well must write more not that i think the most voluminous poets always the best i believe the contrary is rather true i mentioned somewhat to you in london of a pastoral comedy which i should be glad to hear you had thought upon since i find menage in his observations upon tassos aminta reckons up fourscore pastoral plays in italian and in looking over my old italian books i find a great many pastorals and piscatory plays which i suppose menage reckons together i find also by menage that tasso is not the first that writ in that kind he mentioning another before him which he himself had never seen nor indeed have i but as the aminta pastor fido and filli di sciro of bonarelli are the three best so i think there is no dispute but aminta is the best of the three not but that the discourses in pastor fido are more entertaining and copious in several peoples opinion though not so proper for pastoral and the fable of bonarelli more surprising i do not remember many in other languages that have written in this kind with success racans bergeries are much inferior to his lyrick poems and the spaniards are all too full of conceits rapin will have the design of pastoral plays to be taken from the cyclops of euripides i am sure there is nothing of this kind in english worth mentioning and therefore you have that field open to your self you see i write to you without any sort of constraint or method as things come into my head and therefore pray use the same freedom with me who am etc  mr pope to mr walsh july     0  i cannot omit the first opportunity of making you my acknowledgments for reviewing those papers of mine you have no less right to correct me than the same hand that raised a tree has to prune it i am convinced as well as you that one may correct too much for in poetry as in painting a man may lay colors one upon another till they stiffen and deaden the piece besides to bestow heightning on every part is monstrous some parts ought to be lower than the rest and nothing looks more ridiculous than a work where the thoughts however different in their own nature seem all on a level it is like a meadow newly mown where weeds grass and flowers are all laid even and appear undistinguished i believe too that sometimes our first thoughts are the best as the first squeezing of the grapes makes the finest and richest wine  i have not attempted any thing of pastoral comedy because i think the taste of our age will not relish a poem of that sort people seek for what they call wit on all subjects and in all places not considering that nature loves truth so well that it hardly ever admits of flourishing conceit is to nature what paint is to beauty it is not only needless but impairs what it would improve there is a certain majesty in simplicity which is far above all the quaintness of wit insomuch that the critics have excluded it from the loftiest poetry as well as the lowest and forbid it to the epic no less than the pastoral i should certainly displease all those who are charmed with guarini and bonarelli and imitate tasso not only in the simplicity of his thoughts but in that of the fable too if surprising should have place in the story of a pastoral comedy i believe it would be more agreeable to probability to make them the effects of chance than of design intrigue not being very consistent with that innocence which ought to constitute a shepherds character there is nothing in all the aminta as i remember but happens by mere accident unless it be the meeting of aminta with sylvia at the fountain which is the contrivance of daphne and even that is the most simple in the world the contrary is observable in pastor fido where corisca is so perfect a mistress of intrigue that the plot could not have been brought to pass without her i am inclined to think the pastoral comedy has another disadvantage as to the manners its general design is to make us in love with the innocence of a rural life so that to introduce shepherds of a vicious character must in some measure debase it and hence it may come to pass that even the virtuous characters will not shine so much for want of being opposed to their contraries  these thoughts are purely my own and therefore i have reason to doubt them but i hope your judgment will set me right  i would beg your opinion too as to another point it is how far the liberty of borrowing may extend i have defended it sometimes by saying that it seems not so much the perfection of sense to say things that have never been said before as to express those best that have been said oftenest and that writers in the case of borrowing from others are like trees which of themselves would produce only one sort of fruit but by being grafted upon others may yield variety a mutual commerce makes poetry flourish but then poets like merchants should repay with something of their own what they take from others not like pirates make prize of all they meet i desire you to tell me sincerely if i have not stretched this license too far in these pastorals i hope to become a critic by your preceps and a poet by your example since i have seen your eclogues i cannot be much pleased with my own however you have not taken away all my vanity so long as you give me leave to profess my self  yours etc  mr walsh to mr pope july  0   0  i had sooner returned you thanks for the favor of your letter but that i was in hopes of giving you an account at the same time of my journey to windsor but i am now forced to put that quite off being engaged to go to my corporation of richmond in yorkshire i think you are perfectly in the right in your notions of pastoral but i am of opinion that the redundancy of wit you mention though it is what pleases the common people is not what ever pleases the best judges pastor fido indeed has had more admirers than aminta but i will venture to say there is a great deal of difference between the admirers of one and the other corisca which is a character generally admired by the ordinary judges is intolerable in a pastorl and bonarellis fancy of making his shepherdess in love with two men equally is not to be defended whatever pains he has taken to do it as for what you ask of the liberty of borrowing it is very evident the best latin poets have extended this very far and none so far as virgil who is the best of them as for the greek poets if we cannot trace them so plainly it is perhaps because we have none before them it is evident that most of them borrowed from homer and homer has been accused of burning those that wrote before him that his thefts might not be discovered the best of the modern poets in all languages are those that have the nearest copied the ancients indeed in all the common subjects of poetry the thoughts are so obvious at least if they are natural that whoever writes last must write things like what have been said before but they may as well applaud the ancients for the arts of eating and drinking and accuse the moderns of having stolen those inventions from them it being evident in all such cases that whoever live first must first find them out it is true indeed when  unus and alter assuitur pannus when there is one or two bright thoughts stolen and all the rest is quite different from it a poem makes a very foolish figure but when it is all melted down together and the gold of the ancients so mixed with that of the moderns that none can distinguish the one from the other i can never find fault with it i cannot however but own to you that there are others of a different opinion and that i have shown your verses to some who have made that objection to them i have so much company round me while i write this and such a noise in my ears that it is impossible i should write any thing but nonsense so must break off abruptly i am sir  your most affectionate and most humble servant  mr walsh to mr pope sept     0  at my return from the north i received the favor of your letter which had lain there till then having been absent about six weeks i read over your pastorals again with a great deal of pleasure and to judge the better read virgils eclogues and spensers calendar at the same time and i assure you i continue the same opinion i had always of them by the little hints you take upon all occasions to improve them it is probable you will make them yet better against winter though there is a mean to be kept even in that too and a man may correct his verses till he takes away the true spirit of them especially if he submits to the correction of some who pass for great critics by mechanical rules and never enter into the true design and genius of an author i have seen some of these that would hardly allow any one good ode in horace who cry virgil wants fancy and that homer is very incorrect while they talk at this rate one would think them above the common rate of mortals but generally they are great admirers of ovid and lucan and when they write themselves we find out all the mystery they scan their verses upon their fingers run after conceits and glaring thoughts their poems are all made up of couplets of which the first may be last or the last first without any sort of prejudice to their works in which there is no design or method or any thing natural or just for you are certainly in the right that in all writings whatsoever not poetry only nature is to be followed and we should be jealous of our selves for being sond of similes conceits and what they call saying fine things when we werein the north my lord wharton showed me a letter he had received from a certain great the earl of p general in spain i told him i would by all means have that general recalled and set to writing here at home for it was impossible that a man with so much wit as he showed could be fit to command an army or do any other business as for what you say of expression it is indeed the same thing to wit as dress is to beauty i have seen many women overdrest and several look better in a careless nightgown with their hair about their ears than mademoiselle spanheim dressed for a ball i do not design to be in london till toward the parliament then i shall certainly be there and hope by that time you will have finished your pastorals as you would have them appear in the world and particularly the third of autumn which i have not yet seen your last eclogue being upon the same subject as that of mine on mrs tempests death i should take it very kindly in you to give it a little turn as if it were to the memory of the same lady if they were not written for some particular woman whom you would make immortal you may take occasion to show the difference between poets mistresses and other mens i only hint this which you may either do or let alone just as you think fit i shall be very much pleased to see you again in town and to hear from you in the mean time i am with very much esteem  your etc  mr pope to mr walsh oct      0  after the thoughts i have already sent you on the subject of english versification you desire my opinion as to some farther particulars there are indeed certain niceties which though not much observed even by correct versifiers i cannot but think deserve to be better regarded    it is not enough that nothing offends the ear but a good poet will adapt the very sounds as well as words to the things he treats of so that there is if one may express it so a style of sound as in describing a gliding stream the numbers should run easy and slowing in describing a rough torrent or deluge sonorous and swelling and so of the rest this is evident every where in homer and virgil and no where else that i know of to any observable degree the following examples will make this plain which i have taken from vida molle viam tacito lapsu per levia radit incedit tardo molimine subsidendo luctantes ventos tempestatesque sonoras immenso cum praecipitans ruit oceano nox telum imbelle sine ictu conjecit toll moras cape saxa manu cape robora pastor ferte citi flammas data tela repellite pestem   this i think is what very few observe in practice and is undoubtedly of wonderful force in imprinting the image on the reader we have one excellent example of it in our language mr drydens ode on st caecilias day entitled alexanders feast    every nice ear must i believe have observed that in any smooth english verse of ten syllables there is naturally a pause at the fourth fifth or sixth syllable it is upon these the ear rests and upon the judicious change and management of which depends the variety of versification for example  at the fifth wherever thy navy spreads her canvas wings  at the fourth homage to thee and peace to all she brings  at the sixth like tracts of leverets in morning snow  now i fancy that to preserve an exact harmony and variety the pauses of the  th or  th should not be continued above three lines together without the interposition of another else it will be apt to weary the ear with one continued tone at least it does mine that at the  th runs quicker and carries not quite so dead a weight so tires not so much though it be continued longer    another nicety is in relation to expletives whether words or syllables which are made use of purely to supply a vacancy do before verbs plural is absolutely such and it is not improbable but future refiners may explode did and does in the same manner which are almost always used for the sake of rhyme the same cause has occasioned the promiscuous use of you and thou to the same person which can never sound so graceful as either one or the other    i would also object to the irruption of alexandrine verses of twelve syllables which i think should never be allowed but when some remarkable beauty or propriety in them attones for the liberty mr dryden has been too free of these especially in his latter works i am of the same opinion as to triple rhimes    i could equally object to the repetition of the same rhimes within four or six lines of each other as tiresome to the ear through their monotony    monosyllablelines unless very artfully managed are stiff or languishing but may be beautiful to express melancholy slowness or labor    to come to the hiatus or gap between two words which is caused by two vowels opening on each other upon which you desire me to be particular i think the rule in this case is either to use the caesura or admit the hiatus just as the ear is least shocked by either for the caesura sometimes offends the ear more than the hiatus itself and our language is naturally overcharged with consonants as for example if in this verse the old have interest ever in their eye we should say to avoid the hiatus but the old have interest    the hiatus which has the worst effect is when one word ends with the same vowel that begins the following and next to this those vowels whose sounds come nearest to each other are most to be avoided o a or u will bear a more full and graceful sound than e i or y i know some people will think these observations trivial and therefore i am glad to corroborate them by some great authorities which i have met with in tully and quintilian in the fourth book of rhetoric to herennius are these words fugiemus crebras vocalium concursiones quae vastam atque hiantem reddunt orationem ut hoc est baccae aeueae amaenissimae impendebant and quintilian l   cap   vocalium concursus cum accidit hiat and intersistit at quasi laborat oration pessimi long quae easdem inter se literas committunt sonabunt praecipuus tamen erit hiatus earum quae cavo aut patulo ore efseruntur eplenior litera est i anguslior but he goes on to reprove the excess on the other hand of being too sollicitous in this matter and says admirably neio an negligentia in hoc aut solicitudo sit pejor so likewise tully orator ad brut theopompum reprehendunt quod eas literas tanto opere fugerit etsi idem magister ejus isocrates which last author as turnebus on quintilian observe has hardly one hiatus in all his works quintilian tells us that tully and demosthenes did not much observe this nicety though tully himself says in his orator crebra ista vocum concursio quam magna ex part vitiosam fugit demosthenes if i am not mistaken malherbe of all the moderns has been the most scrupulous in this point and i think menage in his observations upon him says he has not one in his poems to conclude i believe the hiatus should be avoided with more care in poetry than in oratory and i would constantly try to prevent it unless where the cutting it off is more prejudicial to the sound than the hiatus itself i am etc mr walsh died at    years old in the year   0  the year after mr pope writ the essay on criticism which he concludes with this gentlemans elogie   letters to several ladies letter i

of em you are but too good a painter already and no picture of raphaels was ever so beautiful as that which you have formed in a certain heart of my acquaintance indeed it was but just that the finest lines in nature should be drawn upon the most durable ground and none could ever be met with that would so readily receive or so faithfully retain them as this heart i may boldly say of it that you will not find its fellow in all the parts of the body in this book but i must complain to you of my hand which is an arrant traitor to my heart for having been copying your picture from thence and from kneller these three days it has done all possible injury to the finest face that ever was made and to the liveliest image that ever was drawn i have imagination enough in your absence to trace some resemblance of you but i have been so long used to lose my judgment at the sight of you that it is past my power to correct it by the life your picture seems least like when placed before your eyes and contrary to all other pictures receives a manifest disadvantage by being set in the fairest light in the world the painters are a very vain generation and have a long time pretended to rival nature but to own the truth to you she made such a finished piece about three and twenty years ago i beg your pardon madam i protest i meant but two and twenty that it is in vain for them any longer to contend with her i know you indeed made one something like it betwixt five and six years past twas a little girl done with abundance of spirit and life and wants nothing but time to be an admirable piece but not to flatter your work i dont think twill ever come up to what your father made however i would not discourage you it is certain you have a strange happiness in making fine things of a sudden and at a stroke with incredible ease and pleasure  madam i am etc  letter ii it is too much a rule in this town that when a lady has once done a man a favor he is to be rude to her ever after it becomes our sex to take upon us twice as much as yours allow us by this method i may write to you most impudently because you once answered me modestly and if you should never do me that honor for the future i am to think like a true coxcomb that your silence gives consent perhaps you wonder why this is addressed to you rather than to mrs m with whom i have the right of an old acquaintance whereas you are a fine lady have bright eyes etc first madam i make choice of you rather than of your mother because you are younger than your mother secondly because i fancy you spell better as having been at school later thirdly because you have nothing to do but to write if you please and possibly it may keep you from employing your self worse it may save some honest neighboring gentleman from three or four of your pestilent glances cast your eyes upon paper madam there you may look innocently men are seducing books are dangerous the amorous ones soften you and the godly ones give you the spleen if you look upon trees they clasp in embraces birds and beasts make love the sun is too warm for your blood the moon melts you into yielding and melancholy therefore i say once more cast your eyes upon paper and read only such letters as i write which convey no darts no flames but proceed from innocence of soul and simplicity of heart however i can allow you a bonnet lined with green for your eyes but take care you dont tarnish it with ogling too fiercely i am told that hand you shade your self with this shining weather is tanned pretty much only with being carried over those eyes  thank god i am an hundred miles off from them  upon the whole i would sooner trust your hand than your eyes for doing me mischief and though i doubt not some part of the rancour and iniquity of your heart will drop into your pen yet since it will not attack me on a sudden and unprepared since i may have time while i break open your letter to cross my self and say a paternoster i hope providence will protect me from all you can attempt at this distance mr b tells me you are at this hour as handsome as an angel for my part i have forgot your face since two winters i dont know whether you are tall or short nor call tell in any respect what sort of creature you are only that you are a very mischievous one whom i shall ever pray to be defended from but when mr b sends me word you have the smallpox a good many freckles or are very pale i will desire him to give thanks for it in your parish church which as soon as he shall inform me he has done i will make you a visit at  without armor i will eat any thing you give me without suspicion of poison take you by the hand without gloves nay venture to follow you into an arbor without calling the company this madam is the top of my wishes but how differently are our desires inclined you sigh out in the ardour of your heart oh play houses parks operas assemblies london i cry with rapture oh woods gardens rookeries fishponds arbours mrs betty m  letter iii to a lady written on the opposite pages of a letter to her husband from lady m the wits would say that this must needs be a dull letter because it is a married one i am afraid indeed you will find what spirit there is must be on the side of the wife and the husbands part as usual will prove the dullest what an unequal pair are put together in this sheet in which though we sin it is you must do penance when you look on both sides of this paper you may fancy that our words according to a scripture expression are as a twoedged sword whereof lady m is the shining blade and i only the handle but i cannot proceed without so far mortifying sir robert as to tell him that she writes this purely in obedience to me and that it is but one of those honors a husband receives for the sake of his wife  it is making court ill to one fine woman to show her the regard we have for another and yet i must own there is not a period of this epistle but squints toward another overagainst it it will be in vain to dissemble your penetrating eyes cannot but discover how all the letters that compose these words lean forward after lady ms letters which seem to bend as much from mine and fly from them as fast as they are able ungrateful letters that they are which give themselves to another man in the very presence of him who will yield to no mortal in knowing how to value them  you will think i forget my self and am not writing to you but let me tell you it is you forget your self in that thought for you are almost the only woman to whom one can safely address the praises of another besides can you imagine a man of my importance so stupid as to say fine things to you before your husband let us see how far lady m her self dares do any thing like it with all the wit and address she is mistress of if sir robert can be so ignorant now he is left to himself in the country to imagine any such matter let him know from me that here in town every thing that lady says is taken for satire for my part every body knows it is my constant practice to speak truth and i never do it more than when i call my self  your etc  letter iv to a lady in the name of her brother if you have not a chaste ear and a pure heart do not peruse this letter for as jeremy tailor says in his holy living and dying the first thing a virgin ought to endeavor is to be ignorant of the distinction of sexes  it is in the confidence i have that you are thus innocent that i endeavor to gratify your curiosity in a point in which i am sensible none but a brother could do it with decency  i shall entertain you with the most reigning curiosity in the town i mean a person who is equally the toast of gentlemen and ladies and is at present more universally admired than any of either sex you know few proficients have a greater genius for monsters than my self but i never tasted a monster to that degree i have done this creature it was not like other monsters produced in the deserts of arabia nor came from the country of the great mogul but is the production of the jointendeavours of a kentish parson and his spouse who intended in the singleness of heart to have begot a christian but of one sex and providence has sent them one of two  there are various opinions concerning this creature about town mr cromwell observes that the age is very licentious and the present reign very lewd and corrupt in permitting a lady by authoriy as appears by the printed bills to expose her personal curiosities for a shilling  mr p looks upon it as a prodigy portending some great revolution in the state to strengthen which opinion he produces the following prophecy of nostradamus which he explains politically when as two sexes joined in one shall in the realm of brute be shown then factions shall unite if i know to choose a prince jure divino this prodigy of common gender is neither sex but a pretender so the lord shield the faiths defender   mrs n admires what people wonder at so much and says she is just so her self the duchess of s is of the same opinion  among these various conjectures that i might be informed of the truth i took along with me a physician and a divine the one to inspect the state of its body the other to examine that of its mind the persons i made choice of were the ingenious dr p and the reverend mr  we were no sooner in the room but the party came to us dressed in that habit in which the ladies affect an hermophroditical imitation of men  your sharp wit my dear sister will immediately conclude that i mean a ridinghabit  i think it not material to inform you whether the doctor the divine or my self looked first the priest you will maliciously fancy was in his nature most an infidel and doubted most of this miracle we therefore proposed to him to take the surest method of believing seeing and feeling he complied with both admonitions and having taken a large pinch of snuff upon it advised us with a nod that we should by no means regard it as a female but as a male for by so doing we should be guilty of less sinfulness  the doctor upon inspection differed from this opinion he would by no means allow it a miracle or at most a natural one he said upon the whole it was a woman that whatever might give a handle to think otherwise was a trifle nothing being more common than for a child to be marked with that thing which the mother longed for  as for this partys temper of mind it appears to be a most even disposition partaking of the good qualities of both sexes for she is neither so inaccessible as other ladies nor is he so impudent as other gentlemen of how obliging and complaisant a turn appears by this that he tells the ladies he has the inclinations of a gentleman and that she tells the gentlemen she has the tender of a lady as a further proof of this affable disposition he formerly received visits of the fair sex in their masks till an impertinent fellow in a female disguise mingled with a party of ladies and impudently overheard their improving speculations  notwithstanding this she civilly promised at my request that my two sisters should be admitted privately whenever you would do her the honor of your consideration  how agreeable soever this sight has been to me i assure you it cannot be so pleasing as the sight of you in town and whatever you may see in the country i dare affirm no man or woman can show you the like  i therefore earnestly desire you to make haste to this place for though indeed like most other brothers i should be sorry you were married at my expense yet i would by no means like them detain you in the country from your admirers for you may believe me no brother in the world ever loved a sister as i do you  i am etc  letter v bath      you are to understand madam that my passion for your fair self and your sister has been divided with the most wonderful regularity in the world even from my infancy i have been in love with one after the other of you week by week and my journey to bath fell out in the three hundred seventy sixth week of the reign of my sovereign lady sylvia at the present writing hereof it is the three hundred eighty ninth week of the reign of your most serene majesty in whose service i was listed some weeks before i beheld your sister this information will account for my writing to either of you hereafter as either shall happen to be queenregent at that time  pray tell your sister all the good qualities and virtuous inclinations she has never gave me so much pleasure in her conversation as that one vice of her obstinacy will give me mortification this month ratcliff commands her to the bath and she refuses indeed if i were in berkshire i should honor her for this obstinacy and magnisy her no less for disobedience than we do the barcelonians but people change with the change of places as we see of late and virtues become vices when they cease to be for ones interest with me as with others  yet let me tell her she will never look so finely while she is upon earth as she would here in the water it is not here as in most other instances for those ladies that would please extremely must go out of their own element she does not make half so good a figure on horseback as christina queen of sweden but were she once seen in the bath no man would part with her for the best mermaid in christendom you know i have seen you often i perfectly know how you look in black and in white i have experienced the utmost you can do in colors but all your movements all your graceful steps deserve not half the glory you might here attain of a moving and easy behavior in buckram something between swimming and walking free enough and more modestlyhalfnaked than you can appear any where else you have conquered enough already by land show your ambition and vanquish also by water we have no pretty admirals on these seas but must strike sails to your white flags were they once hoisted up the buckram i mention is a dress particularly useful at this time when we are told the princess is bringing over the fashion of german ruffs you ought to use your selves to some degrees of stiffness beforehand and when our ladies chins have been tickled awhile with starched muslin and wire they may possibly bear the brush of a german beard and whisker  i could tell you a delightful story of dr p but want room to display it in all its shining circumstances he had heard it was an excellent cure for love to kiss the aunt of the person beloved who is generally of years and experience enough to damp the fiercest flame he tried this course in his passion and kissed mrs e at mr ds but he says it will not do and that he loves you as much as ever  yours etc  letter vi to the same if you ask how the waters agree with me i must tell you so very well that i question how you and i should agree if we were in a room by our selves mrs t has honestly assured me that but for some whims which she cannot entirely conquer she would go and see the world with me in mans clothes even you madam i fancy if you would not partake in our adventures would wait our coming in at the evening with some impatience and be well enough pleased to hear em by the fireside that would be better than reading romances unless lady m would be our historian for as she is married she has probably leisure hours in the nightime to write or do what she will in what raises these desires in me is an acquaintance i am beginning with my lady sandwich who has all the spirit of the last age and all the gay experience of a pleasurable life it were as scandalous an omission to come to the bath and not to see my lady sandwich as it had formerly been to have traveled to rome without visiting the queen of sweeden she is in a word the best thing this country has to boast of and as she has been all that a woman of spirit could be so she still continues that easy and independent creature that a sensible woman always will be  i must tell you a truth which is not however much to my credit i never thought so must of your self and your sister as since i have been fourscore miles distance from you in the forest i looked upon you as good neighbors at london as pretty kind of women but here as divinities angels goddesses or what you will in the same manner i never knew at what a rate i valued your life till you were upon the point of dying if mrs t and you will but fall very sick every season i shall certainly die for you seriously i value you both so much that i esteem others much the less for your sakes you have robbed me of the pleasure of esteeming a thousand pretty qualities in them by showing me so many finer in your selves there are but two things in the world which could make you indifferent to me which i believe you are not capable of i mean ill nature and malice i have seen enough of you not to overlook any frailty you could have and nothing less than a vice can make me like you less i expect you should discover by my conduct toward you both that this is true and that therefore you should pardon a thousand things in me for that one disposition expect nothing from me but truths and freedom and i shall always be thought by you what i always am  yours etc  letter vii to the same i returned home as slow and as contemplative after i had parted from you as my lord  retired from the court and glory to his country seat and wife a week ago i found here a dismal desponding letter from the son of another great courtier who expects the same fate and who tells me the great ones of the earth will now take it very kindly of the mean ones if they will favor them with a visit by daylight with what joy would they lay down all their schemes of glory did they but know you have the generosity to drink their healths once a day as soon as they are fallen thus the unhappy by the sole merit of their misfortunes become the care of heaven and you i intended to have put this last into verse but in this age of ingratitude my best friends forsake me i mean my rhymes  i desire mrs p to stay her stomach with these half hundred plays till i can procure her a romance big enough to satisfy her great soul with adventures as for novels i fear she can depend upon none from me but that of my life which i am still as i have been contriving all possible methods to shorten for the greater ease both of my historian and the reader may she believe all the passion and tenderness expressed in these romances to be but a faint image of what i bear her and may you who read nothing take the same truth upon hearing it from me you will both injure me very much if you dont think me a truer friend than ever any romantic lover or any imitator of their style could be  the days of beauty are as the days of greatness and as long as your eyes make their sunshine all the world are your adorers i am one of those unambitious people who will love you forty years hence when your eyes begin to twinkle in a retirement for your own sakes and without the vanity which every one now will take to be thought  your etc  letter viii you have asked me news a hundred times at the first word you spoke to me which some would interpret as if you expected nothing better from my lips and truly it is not a sign two lovers are together when they can be so impertinent as to enquire what the world does all i mean by this is that either you or i are not in love with the other i leave you to guess which of the two is that stupid and insensible creature so blind to the others excellencies and charms  this then shall be a letter of news and sure if you did not think me the humblest creature in the world you could never imagine a poet could dwindle to a brother of dawks and dyer from a rival of tate and brady  the earl of oxford has behaved so bravely that in this act at least he might seem above man if he had not just now voided a stone to prove him subject to human infirmities the utmost weight of affliction from princely power and popular hatred were almost worth bearing for the glory of such a dauntless conduct as he has shown under it  you may soon have your wish to enjoy the gallant sights of armies incampments standards waving over your brothers cornfields and the pretty windings of the thames about m stained with the blood of men your barbarity which i have heard so long exclaimed against in town and country may have its fill of destruction i would not add one circumstance usual in all descriptions of calamity that of the many rapes committed or to be committed upon those unfortunate women that delight in war but god forgive me  in this martial age if i could i would buy a regiment for your sake and mrs ps and some others whom i have cause to fear no fair means will prevail upon  those eyes that care not how much mischief is done or how great slaughter committed so they have but a fine show those veryfemale eyes will be infinitely delighted with the camp which is speedily to be formed in hydepark the tents are carried thither this morning new regiments with new cloths and furniture far exceeding the late cloth and linen designed by his grace for the soldiery the sight of so many gallant fellows with all the pomp and glare of war yet undeformd by battle those scenes which england has for many years only beheld on stages may possibly invite your curiosity to this place  mrs  expects the pretender at her lodgings by saturday sennight she has bought a picture of madam maintenon to set her features by against that time three priests of your acquaintance are very positive by her interest to be his father confessor  by our latest accounts from dukestreet westminster the conversion of t g esquire is reported in a manner somewhat more particular that upon the seizure of his flandersmares he seemed more than ordinarily disturbed for some hours sent for his ghostly father and resolved to bear his loss like a christian till about the hours of seven or eight the coaches and horses of several of the nobility passing by the window toward hydepark he could no longer endure the disapointment but instantly went out took the oath of abjuration and recovered his dear horses which carried him in triumph to the ring the poor distressed roman catholics now unhorsd and uncharioted cry out with the psalmist some in chariots and some in horses but we will invocate the name of the lord  i am etc  letter ix i will not describe bl in particular not to forestall your expectations before you see it only take a short account which i will hazard my little credit is no unjust one i never saw so great a thing with so much littleness in it i think the architect built it entirely in compliance to the taste of its owners for it is the most inhospitable thing imaginable and the most selfish it has like their own hearts no room for strangers and no reception for any person of superior quality to themselves there are but two apartments for the master and mistress below and but two apartments above very much inferior to them in the whole house when you look upon the outside you would think it large enough for a prince when you see the inside it is too little for a subject and has not convenience to lodge a common family it is a house of entries and passages among which there are three vistas through the whole very uselessly handsome there is what might have been a fine gallery but spoiled by two arches toward the end of it which take away the sight of several of the windows there are two ordinary staircases instead of one great one the best things within the house are the hall which is indeed noble and wellproportiond and the cellars and offices underground which are the most commodious and the best contrived of the whole at the top of the building are several cupolas and little turrets that have but an ill effect and make the building look at once finical and heavy what seems of the best taste is that front toward the gardens which is not yet loaded with these turrets the two sides of the building are entirely spoiled by two monstrous bowwindows which stand just in the middle instead of doors and as if it were fatal that some trifling littleness should every where destroy the grandeur there are in the chief front two semicircles of a lower structure than the rest that cut off the arges and look as it they were purposely designed to hide a lostier and nobler piece of building the top of which appears above them in a word the whole is a most expensive absurdity and the duke of s gave a true character of it when he said it was a great quarry of stones above ground  we paid a visit to the spring where rosamond bathed her self on a hill where remains only a piece of a wall of the old palace of henry the second we toasted her shade in the cold water not without a thought or two scarce so cold as the liquor we drank it in i dare not tell you what they were and so hasten to conclude  your etc  letter x you cannot be surprised to find him a dull correspondent whom you have known so long for a dull companion and though i am pretty sensible that it i have any wit i may as well write to show it as not because any lady that has once seen me will naturally ask what i can show that is better yet i will content my self with giving you as plain a history of my pilgrimage as purchase himself or as john bunyan could do of his walking through the wilderness of this world etc  first then i went by water to hampton court unattended by all but my own virtues which were not of so modest a nature as to keep themselves or me concealed for i met the prince with all his ladies on horseback coming from hunting mrs b and mrs l took me into protection contrary to the laws against harboring papists and gave me a dinner with something i liked better an opportunity of conversation with mrs h we all agreed that the life of a maid of honor was of all things the most miserable and wished that every woman who envied it had a specimen of it to eat westphaliaham in a morning ride over hedges and ditches on borrowed hacks come home in the heat of the day with a fever and what is worse a hundred times with a red mark in the forehead from an uneasy hat all this may qualify them to make excellent wives for foxhunters and bear abundance of ruddycomplexiond children as soon as they can wipe off the sweat of the day they must simper an hour and catch cold in the princesss apartment from thence as shakespeare has it to dinner with what appetite they may  and after that till midnight walk work or think which they please i can easily believe no lonehouse in wales with a mountain and a rookery is more contemplative than this court and as a proof of it i need only tell you mrs l walked all alone with me three or four hours by moonlight and we met no creature of any quality but the king who gave audience to the vicechamberlain all alone under the garden wall  in short i heard of no ball assembly bassettable or any place where two or three were gathered together except madam kilmanseggs to which i had the honor to be invited and the grace to stay away  i was heartily tired and posted to b park there we had an excellent discourse of quackery dr shadwell was mentioned with honor lady a walked a whole hour abroad without dying after it at least in the time i stayed though she seemed to be fainting and had convulsive motions several times in her head  this day i received a letter with certain advices were women were to be met with at oxford i defy them and all their works i love no meat but ortolans and no women but you though indeed that is no proper comparison but for fat duchesss for to love you is as if one should wish to eat angels or to drink cherubimbroth  i arrived in the forest by tuesday noon having fled from the face i wish i could say the horned face of moles b who dined in the midway thither i past the rest of the day in those woods where i have so often enjoyed a book and a friend i made a hymn as i passed through which ended with a sigh that i will not tell you the meaning of  your doctor is gone the way of all his patients and was hard put to it how to dispose of an estate miserably unweildy and splendidly unuseful to him sir samuel garth says that for ratcliffe to leave a library was as if a eunuch should found a seraglio dr she lately told a lady he wondered she could be alive after him she made answer she wondered at it for two reasons because dr ratcliffe was dead and because dr she was living i am  your etc  letter xi to the same nothing could have more of that melancholy which once used to please me than my last days journey for after having passed through my favorite woods in the forest with a thousand reveries of past pleasures i rid over hanging hills whose tops were edged with groves and whose feet watered with winding rivers listening to the falls of cataracts below and the murmuring of the winds above the gloomy verdure of stonor succeeded to these and then the shades of the evening overtook me the moon rose in the clearest sky i ever saw by whose solemn light i paced on slowly without company or any interruption to the range of my thoughts about a mile before i reached oxford all the bells tolled in different notes the clocks of every college answered one another and sounded forth some in a deeper some in a softer tone that it was eleven at night all this was no ill preparation to the life i have led since among those old walls venerable galleries stone porticos studious walks and solitary scenes of the university i wanted nothing but a black gown and a salary to be as mere a bookworm as any there i conformed myself to the college hours was rolled up in books lay in one of the most ancient dusky parts of the university and was as dead to the world as any hermit of the desert if any thing was alive or a wake in me it was a little vanity such as even those good men used to entertain when the monks of their own order extolled their piety and abstraction for i found my self received with a sort of respect which this idle part of mankind the learned pay to their own species who are as considerable here as the busy the gay and the ambitious are in your world  indeed i was treated in such a manner that i could not but sometimes ask my self in my mind what college i was founder of or what library i had built methinks i do very ill to return to the world again to leave the only place where i make a figure and from seeing my self seated with dignity in the most conspicuous shelves of a library put myself into the abject posture of lying at a ladys feet in st jamess square  i will not deny but that like alexander in the midst of my glory i am wounded and find myself a mere man to tell you from whence the dart comes is to no purpose since neither of you will take the tender care to draw it out of my heart and suck the poison with your lips  here at my lord hs i see a creature nearer an angel than a woman though a woman be very near as good as an angel i think you have formerly heard me mention mrs t as a credit to the maker of angels she is a relation of his lordships and he gravely proposed her to me for a wife being tender of her interests and knowing what is a shame to providence that she is less indebted to fortune than i i told him twas what he could never have thought of if it had not been his misfortune to be blind and what i never could think of while i had eyes to see both her and myself  i must not conclude without telling you that i will do the utmost in the affair you desire it would be an inexpressible joy to me if i could serve you and i will always do all i can to give my self pleasure i wish as well for you as for my self i am in love with you both as much as i am with my self for i find my self most so with all three when i least suspect it  i am etc  letter xii to mrs arabella fermor on her marriage you are by this time satisfied how much the tenderness of one man of merit is to be preferred to the addresses of a thousand and by this time the gentleman you have made choice of is sensible how great is the joy of having all those charms and good qualities which have pleased so many now applied to please one only it was but just that the same virtues which gave you reputation should give you happiness and i can wish you no greater than that you may receive it in as high a degree your self as so much good humor must infallibly give it to your husband  it may be expected perhaps that one who has the title of poet should say something more polite on this occasion but i am really more a wellwisher to your felicity than a celebrater of your beauty besides you are now a married woman and in a way to be a great many better things than a fine lady such as an excellent wife a faithful friend a tender parent and at last as the consequence of them all a saint in heaven you ought now to hear nothing but that which was all you ever desired to hear whatever others may have spoken to you i mean truth and it is with the utmost that i assure you no friend you have can more rejoice in any good that befalls you is more sincerely delighted with the prospect of your future happiness or more unfeignedly desires a long continuance of it i beg you will think it but just that a man who will certainly be spoken of as your admirer after he is dead may have the happiness to be esteemed while he is living  your etc  letter xiii the chief cause i have to repent my leaving the town is the uncertainty i am in every day of your sisters state of health i really expected by every post to have heard of her recovery but on the contrary each letter has been a new awakening to my apprehensions and i have ever since suffered allarms upon allarms on her account no one can be more sensibly touched at this than i nor any danger of any i love could affect me with more uneasiness though as i never had a sister i cannot be quite so good a judge as you how far humanity would carry me i have felt some weaknesses of a tender kind which i would not be free from and i am glad to find my value for people so rightly placed as to perceive them on this occasion  i cannot be so good a christian as to be willing though no less than god should order it to resign my own happiness here for here is in another life i do more than wish for her safety for every wish i make i find immediately changed into a prayer and a more fervent one than i had learned to make till now  may her life be longer and happier than perhaps her self may desire that is as long and as happy as your self can wish may her beauty be as great as possible that is as it always was or as yours is but whatever ravages a merciless distemper may commit i dare promise her boldly what few if any of her makers of visits and complements dare to do she shall have one man as much her admirer as ever as for your part madam you have me so more than ever since i have been a witness to the generous tenderness you have shown upon this occasion  your etc  letter xiv it is with infinite satisfaction i am made acquainted that your brother will at last prove your relation and has entertained such sentiments as become him in your concern i have been prepared for this by degrees having several times received from mrs  that which is one of the greatest pleasures the knowledge that others entered into my own sentiments concerning you i ever was of opinion that you wanted no more to be vindicated than to be known and like truth could appear no where but you must conquer as i have often condold with you in your adversities so i have a right which but few can pretend to of congratulating on the prospect of your better fortunes and i hope for the future to have the concern i have felt for you overpaid in your felicities though you modestly say the world has left you yet i verily believe it is coming to you again as fast as it can for to give the world its due it is always very fond of merit when it is past its power to oppose it therefore if you should take it into favor again upon its repentance and continue in it you would be so far from leading what is commonly called an unsettled life and what you with too much unjust severity call a vagabond life that the wise could only look upon you as a prince in a progress who travels to gain the affections he has not or to fix those he already has which he effectually does wherever he shows himself but if you are resolved in revenge to rob the world of so much example as you may afford it i believe your design will be vain for even in a monastery your devotions cannot carry you so far toward the next world as to make this lose the sight of you but you will be like a star that while it is fixed to heaven shines over all the earth  wheresoever providence shall dispose of the most valuable thing i know i shall ever follow you with my sincerest wishes and my best thoughts will be perpetually waiting upon you when you never hear of me or them your own guardian angels cannot be more constant nor more silent i beg you will never cease to think me your friend that you may not be guilty of that which you never yet knew to commit an injustice as i have hitherto been so in spite of the world so hereafter if it be possible you should ever be more opposed and more deserted i should only be so much the more  your faithful etc  letter xv i can say little to recommend the letters i shall write to you but that they will be the most impartial representations of a free heart and the truest copies you ever saw though of a very mean original not a feature will be softened or any advantageous light employed to make the ugly thing a little less hideous but you shall find it in all respects most horribly like you will do me an injustice if you look upon any thing i shall say from this instant as a compliment either to you or my self whatever i write will be the real thought of that hour and i know you will no more expect it of me to persevere till death in every sentiment or notion i now set down than you would imagine a mans face should never change when once his picture was drawn  the freedom i shall use in this manner of thinking aloud may indeed prove me a fool but it will prove me one of the best sort of fools the honest ones and since what folly we have will infallibly buoy up at one time or other in spite of all our art to keep it down methinks it is almost foolish to take any pains to conceal it at all and almost knavish to do it from those that are our friends if momuss project had taken of having windows in our breasts i should be for carrying it further and making those windows casements that while a man showed his heart to all the world he might do something more for his friends even give it them and trust it to their handling i think i love you as well as king herod did herodias though i never had so much as one dance with you and would as freely give you my heart in a dish as he did anothers head but since jupiter will not have it so i must be content to show my taste in life as i do my taste in painting by loving to have as little drapery as possible not that i think every body naked altogether so fine a sight as your self and a few more would be but because it is good to use people to what they must be acquainted with and there will certainly come some day of judgment or other to uncover every soul of us we shall then see that the prues of this world owed all their fine figure only to their being straterlacd than the rest and that they are naturally as arrant squabs as those that never girded their loins at all  but a particular reason that may engage you to write your thoughts the more freely to me is that i am confident no one knows you better for i find when others express their thoughts of you they fall very short of mine and i know at the same time theirs are such as you would think sufficient in your favor  you may easily imagine how desirous i must be of a correspondence with a person who had taught me long ago that it was as possible to esteem at first sight as to love and who has since ruined me for all the conversation of one sex and almost all the friendship of the other i am but too sensible through your means that the company of men wants a certain softness to recommend it and that of women wants every thing else how often have i been quietly going to take possession of that tranquillity and indolence i had so long found in the country when one evening of your conversation has spoiled me for a solitaire books have lost their effect upon me and i was convinced since i saw you that there is one alive wiser than all the sages a plague of female wisdom it makes a man ten times more uneasy than his own what is very strange virtue herself when you have the dressing her is too amiable for ones repose you might have done a world of good in your time if you had allowed half the fine gentlemen who have seen you to have conversed with you they would have been strangely bit while they thought only to fall in love with a fair lady and you had bewitched them with reason and virtue two beauties that the very fops pretend to have no acquaintance with  the unhappy distance at which we correspond removes a great many of those restrictions and punctilious decorums that oftentimes in nearer conversation prejudice truth to save good breeding i may now hear of my faults and you of your good qualities without a blush we converse upon such unfortunate generous terms as exclude the regards of fear shame or design in either of us and methinks it would be as paltry a part to impose even in a single thought upon each other in this state of separation as for spirits of a different sphere who have so little intercourse with us to employ that little as some would make us think they do in putting tricks and delusions upon poor mortals  let me begin then madam by asking you a question that may enable me to judge better of my own conduct than most instances of my life in what manner did i behave the last hour i saw you what degree of concern did i discover when i felt a misfortune which i hope you will never feel that of parting from what one most esteems for if my parting looked but like that of your common acquaintance i am the greatest of all the hypocrites that ever decency made  i never since pass by your house but with the same sort of melancholy that we feel upon seeing the tomb of a friend which only serves to put us in mind of what we have lost i reflect upon the circumstances of your departure which i was there a witness of your behavior in what i may call your last moments and i indulge a gloomy kind of pleasure in thinking that those last moments were given to me i would fain imagine this was not accidental but proceeded from a penetration which i know you have in finding out the truth of peoples sentiments and that you were willing the last man that would have parted from you should be that last that did i really looked upon you just as the friends of curtius might have done upon that hero at the instant when he was devoting himself to glory and running to be lost out of generosity i was obliged to admire your resolution in as great a degree as i deplored it and had only to wish that heaven would reward so much virtue as was to be taken from us with all the felicities it could enjoy elsewhere  i am etc  letter xvi you will find me more troublesome than ever brutus did his evil genius i shall meet you in more places than one and often refresh your memory before you arrive at your philippi these shadows of me my letters will be haunting you from time to time and putting you in mind of the man who has really suffered very much from you and whom you have robbed of the most valuable of his enjoyments your conversation the advantage of hearing your sentiments by discovering mine was what i always thought a great one and even worth the risque i generally run of manifesting my own indiscretion you then rewarded my trust in you the moment it was given for you pleased or informed me the minute you answered i must now be contented with more slow returns however it is some pleasure that your thoughts upon paper will be a more lasting possession to me and that i shall no longer have cause to complain of a loss i have so often regretted that of any thing you said which i happened to forget in earnest madam if i were to write to you as often as i think of you it must be every day of my life i attend you in spirit through all your ways i follow you through every stage in books of travels and fear for you through whole folios you make me shrink at the past dangers of dead travelers and if i read of a delightful prospect or agreeable place i hope it yet subsists to please you i enquire the roads the amusements the company of every town and country through which you pass with as much diligence as if i were to set out next week to overtake you in a word no one can have you more constantly in mind not even your guardian angel if you have one and i am willing to indulge so much popery as to fancy some being takes care of you who knows your value better than you do your self i am willing to think that heaven never gave so much selfneglect and resolution to a woman to occasion her calamity but am pious enough to believe those qualities must be intended to conduce to her benefit and her glory  your first short letter only serves to show me you are alive it puts me in mind of the first dove that returned to noah and just made him know it had found no rest abroad  there is nothing in it that pleases me but when you tell me you had no seasickness i beg your next may give me all the pleasure it can that is tell me any that you receive you can make no discoveries that will be half so valuable to me as those of your own mind nothing that regards the states or kingdoms you pass through will engage so much of my curiosity or concern as what relates to yourself your welfare to say truth is more at my heart than that of christendom  i am sure i may defend the truth though perhaps not the virtue of this declaration one is ignorant or doubtful at best of the merits of differing religions and governments but private virtues one can be sure of i therefore know what particular person has desert enough to merit being happier than others but not what nation deserves to conquer or oppress another you will say i am not publickspirited let it be so i may have too many tendernesses particularly regards or narrow views but at the same time i am certain that whoever wants these can never have a publickspirit for as a friend of mine says how is it possible for that man to love twenty thousand people who never loved one  i communicated your letter to mr c he thinks of you and talks of you as he ought i mean as i do and one always thinks that to be just as it ought his health and mine are now so good that we wish with all our souls you were a witness of it we never meet but we lament over you we pay a kind of weekly rites to your memory where we strew flowers of rhetoric and offer such libations to your name as it would be profane to call toasting the duke of bm is sometimes the high priest of your praises and upon the whole i believe there are as few men that are not sorry at your departure as women that are for you know most of your sex want good sense and therefore must want generosity you have so much of both that i am sure you pardon them for one cannot but forgive whatever one despises for my part i hate a great many women for your sake and undervalue all the rest it is you are to blame and may god revenge it upon you with all those blessings and earthly prosperities which the divines tell us are the cause of our perdition for if he makes you happy in this world i dare trust your own virtue to do it in the other i am  your etc  letters to the honorable robert digby from mr pope to the honorable robert digby chiswick jan        dear sir i had pleased myself sooner in writing to you but that i have been your successor in a fit of sickness and am not yet so much recovered but that i have thoughts of using your asses physicians they are as grave persons as any of the faculty and like the ancients carry their own medicaments about with them but indeed the moderns are such lovers of raillery that nothing is grave enough to escape them let em laugh but people will still have their opinions as they think our doctors asses to them well think them asses to our doctors  i am glad you are so much in a better state of health as to follow me to jest about it my concern when i heard of your danger was so very serious that i almost take it ill dr evans should tell you of it or you mention it i tell you fairly if you and a few more such people were to leave the world i would not give sixpence to stay in it  i am not so much concerned as to the point whether you are to live fat or lean most men of wit or honesty are usually decreed to live very lean so i am inclined to the opinion that it is decreed you shall however be comforted and reflect that you will make the better busto for it  it is something particular in you not to be satisfied with sending me your own books but to make your acquaintance continue the frolic mr wharton forced me to take gorboduc which has since done me great credit with several people as it has done dryden and oldham some diskindness in showing there is as much difference between their gorboduc and this as between queen anne and king george it is truly a scandal that men should write with contempt of a piece which they never once saw as those two poets did who were ignorant even of the sex as well as sense of gorboduc  adieu i am going to forget you this minute you took up all my mind the next i shall think of nothing but the terms of agamemnon and the recovery of briseis i shall be achilless humble servant these two months with the good leave of all my friends i have no ambition so strong at present as that noble one of sir salathiel lovel recorder of london to furnish out a decent and plentiful execution of greeks and trojans  it is not to be expressed how heartily i wish the death of all homers heroes one after another the lord preserve me in the day of battle which is just approaching dear sir join in your prayers for me and know me to be always whether i live die or am damned as a poet  yours most faithfully  to the same london march         dear sir to convince you how little pain i give myself in corresponding with men of good nature and good understanding you see i omit to answer your letters till a time when another man would be ashamed to own he had received them if therefore you are ever moved on my account by that spirit which i take to be as familiar to you as a quotidian ague i mean the spirit of goodness pray never stint it in any fear of obliging me to a civility beyond my natural inclination i dare trust you sir not only with my folly when i write but with my negligence when i do not and expect equally your pardon for either  if i knew how to entertain you through the rest of this paper it should be spotted and diversified with conceits all over you should be put out of breath with laughter at each sentence and pause at each period to look back over how much wit you had passed but i have found by experience that people now adays regard writing as little as they do preaching the most we can hope is to be heard just with decency and patience once a week by folks in the country here in town we hum over a piece of fine writing and we whistle at a sermon the stage is the only place we seem alive at there indeed we stare and roar and clap hands for k george and the government as for all other virtues but this loyalty they are an obsolete train so illdressd that men women and children hiss em out of all good company humility knocks so sneakingly at the door that every footman outraps it and makes it give way to the free entrance of pride prodigality and vainglory  my lady scudamore from having rusticated in your company too long really behaves herself scandalously among us she pretends to open her eyes for the sake of seeing the sun and to sleep because it is night drinks tea at nine in the morning and is thought to have said her prayers before talks without any manner of shame of good books and has not seen cibbers play of the nonjuror i rejoiced the other day to see a libel on her toilette which gives me some hope that you have at least a taste of scandal left you in defect of all other vices  upon the whole matter i heartily wish you well but as i cannot entirely desire the ruin of all the joys of this city so all that remains is to wish you would keep your happiness to your selves that the happiest here may not die with envy at a bliss which they cannot attain to  i am etc  to the same may      0 dear sir you will think me very full of my self when after a long silence which however to say truth has rather been employed to contemplate of you than to forget you i begin to talk of my own works i find it is in the finishing a book as in concluding a session of parliament one always thinks it will be very soon and finds it very late there are many unlooked for incidents to retard the clearing any public account and so i see it is in mine i have plagued myself like great ministers with undertaking too much for one man and with a desire of doing more than was expected from me have done less than i ought  for having designed four very laborious and uncommon sorts of indexes to homer i am forced for want of time to publish two only the design of which you will own to be pretty though far from being fully executed i have also been obliged to leave unfinished in my desk the heads of two essays one on the theology and morality of homer and another on the oratory of homer and virgil so they must wait for future editions or perish and one way or other no great matter which dabit deus his quoque finem  i think of you every day i assure you even without such good memorials of you as your sisters with whom i sometimes talk of you and find it one of the most agreeable of all subjects to them my lord digby must be perpetually remembered by all who ever knew him or knew his children there needs no more than an acquaintance with your family to make all elder sons wish they had fathers to their livesend  i cannot touch upon the subject of filial love without putting you in mind of an old woman who has a sincere hearty oldfashioned respect for you and constantly blames her son for not having writ to you oftener to tell you so  i very much wish but what signifies my wishing my lady scudamore wishes your sisters wish that you were with us to compare the beautiful contrast this season affords us of the town and the country no ideas you could form in the winter can make you imagine what twickenham is and what your friend mr johnson of twickenham is in this warmer season our river glitters beneath an unclouded sun at the same time that its banks retain the verdure of showers our gardens are offering their first nosegays our trees like new acquaintance brought happily together are stretching their arms to meet each other and growing nearer and nearer every hour the birds are paying their thanksgiving songs for the new habitations i have made em my building rites high enough to attract the eye and curiosity of the passenger from the river where upon beholding a mixture of beauty and ruin he enquires what house is falling or what church is rising so little taste have our common tritons of vitruvius whatever delight the true unseen poetical gods of the river may take in reflecting on their streams my tuscan porticos or ionic pilasters  but to descend from all this pomp of style the best account i can give of what i am building is that it will afford me a few pleasant rooms for such a friend as yourself or a cool situation for an hour or two for lady scudamore when she will do me the honor at this public house on the road to drink her own cider  the moment i am writing this i am surprised with the account of the death of a friend of mine which makes all i have here been talking of a mere jest buildings gardens writings pleasures works of whatever stuff man can raise none of them god knows capable of advantaging a creature that is mortal or of satisfying a soul that is immortal dear sir i am  your most faithful servant  to the same july  0    0 your kind desire to know the state of my health had not been unsatisfied of so long had not that ill state been the impediment nor should i have seemed an unconcerned party in the joys of your family which i heard of from lady scudamore whose short eschantillon of a letter of a quarter of a page i value as the short glimpse of a vision afforded to some devout hermit for it includes as those revelations do a promise of a better life in the elysian groves of cirencester whither i could almost say in the style of a sermon the lord bring us all etc thither may we tend by various ways to one blissful bower thither may health peace and good humor wait upon us as associates thither may whole cargoes of nectar liquor of life and longaevity by mortals called spgwater be conveyed and there as milton has it may we like the deities on flowers reposed and with fresh gerlands crowned quaff immortality and joy    when i speak of garlands i should not forget the green vestments and scarfs which your sisters promised to make for this purpose i expect you too in green with a huntinghorn by your side and a green hat the model of which you may take from osbornes description of king james the first  what words what numbers what oratory or what poetry can suffice to express how infinitely i esteem value love and desire you all above all the great ones the rich ones and the vain ones of this part of the world above all the jews jobbers bubblers subscribers projectors directors governors treasurers etc etc etc etc in saecula soeculorum  turn your eyes and attention from this miserable mercenary period and turn yourself in a just contempt of these sons of mammon to the contemplation of books gardens and marriage in which i now leave you and return wretch that i am to water gruel and palladio  i am etc  to the same twickenham sept   dear sir your doctor is going to the bath and stays a fortnight or more perhaps you would be comforted to have a sight of him whether you need him or not i think him as good a doctor as any for one that is ill and a better doctor than any for one that is well he would do admirably for mrs mary digby she needed only to follow his hints to be in eternal business and amusement of mind and even as active as she could desire but indeed i fear she would outwalk him for as dean swift observed to me the very first time i saw the doctor he is a man that can do every thing but walk his brother who is lately come into england goes also to the bath and is a more extraordinary man than he worth your going thither on purpose to know him the spirit of philanthropy so long dead to our world is revived in him he is a philosopher all of fire so warmly nay so wildly in the right that he sorces all others about him to be so too and draws them into his own vortex he is a star that looks as if it were all fire but is all banignity all gentle and beneficial influence if there be other men in the world that would serve a friend yet he is the only one i believe that could make even an enemy serve a friend  as all human life is checkered and mixed with acquisitions and losses though the latter are more certain and irremediable than the former lasting or satisfactory so at the time i have gained the acquaintance of one worthy man i have lost another a very easy human and gentlemanly neighbor mr stonor it is certain the loss of one of this character puts us naturally upon setting a greater value on the sew that are left though the degree of our esteem may be different nothing says seneca is so melancholy a circumstance in human life or so soon reconciles us to to the thought of our own death as the reflection and prospect of one friend after another dropping round us who would stand alone the sole remaining ruin the last tottering column of all the fabric of friendship once so large seemingly so strong and yet so suddenly sunk and buried  i am etc  to the same saturday night dear sir i have belief enough in the goodness of your whole family to think you will all be pleased that i am arrived in saftey at twickenham though it is a sort of earnest that you will be troubled again with me at sherborne or coleshill for however i may like one of your places it may be in that as in liking one of your family when one secs the rest one likes them all pray make my services acceptable to them i wish them all the happiness they may want and the continuance of all the happiness they have and i take the latter to comprize a great deal more than the former i must separate lady scudamore from you as i fear she will do herself before this letter reaches you so i wish her a good journey and i hope one day to try if she lives as well as you do though i much question if she can live as quietly i suspect the bells will be ringing at her arrival and on her own and miss scudamores birthdays and that all the clergy in the county come to pay respects both the clergy and their bells expecting from her and from the young lady further business and further employment besides all this there dwells on the one side of her the lord coningsby and on the other mr w yet i shall when the days and the years come about adventure upon all this for her sake  i beg my lord digby to think me a better man than to content myself with thanking him in the common way i am in as sincere a sense of the word his servant as you are his son or he your father  i must in my turn insist upon hearing how my last fellowtravellers got home from clarendon and desire mr philips to remember me in his cider and to tell mr w that i am dead and buried  i wish the young ladies whom i almost robbed of their good name a better name in return even that very name to each of them which they like best for the sake of the man that bears it  your ever faithful and affectionate servant  to the same      your making a sort of apology for your not writing is a very genteel reproof to me i know i was to blame but i know i did not intend to be so and what is the happiest knowledge in the world i know you will forgive me for sure nothing is more satisfactory than to be certain of such a friend as will overlook ones failings since every such instance is a conviction of his kindness  if i am all my life to dwell in intentions and never to rise to actions i have but too much need of that gentle disposition which i experience in you but i hope better things of myself and fully purpose to make you a visit this summer at sherbourn i am told you are all upon removal very speedily and that mrs mary digly talks in a letter to lady scudamore of seeing my lord bathursts wood in her way how much i wish to be her guide through that enchanted forest is not to be expressed i look upon myself as the magician appropriated to the place without whom no mortal can penetrate into the recesses of those sacred shades i could pass whole days in only describing to her the future and as yet visionary beauties that are to rise in those scenes the palace that is to be built the pavillions that are to glitter the colonnades that are to adorn them nay more the meeting of the thames and the severn which when the noble owner has finer dreams than ordinary are to be led into each others embraces through secret caverns of not above twelve or fifteen miles till they rise and openly celebrate their marriage in the midst of an immense amphitheatre which is to be the admiration of posterity a hundred years hence but till the destined time shall arrive that is to manifest these wonders mrs digly must content herself with seeing what is at present no more than the finest wood in england  the objects that attract this part of the world are of a quite different nature women of quality are all turned followers of the camp in hydepark this year whither all the town resort to magnificent entertainments given by the officers etc the seythian ladies that dwelt in the wagons of war were not more closely attached to the luggage the matrons like those of sparta attend their sons to the field to be the witnesses of their glorious deeds and the maidens with all their charms displayed provoke the spirit of the soldiers tea and coffee supply the place of lacedemonian black broth this camp seems crowded with perpetual victory for every sun that rises in the thunder of cannon sets in the music of violins nothing is yet wanting but the constant presence of the princess to represent the matter exercitus  at twickenham the world goes otherwise there are certain old people who take up all my time and will hardly allow me to keep any other company they were introduced here by a man of their own sort who has made me perfectly rude to all my contemporaries and will not so much as suffer me to look upon em the person i complain of is the bishop of rochester yet he allows me form something he has heard of your character and that of your family as if you were of the old sect of moralists to write three or four sides of paper to you and to tell you what these sort of people never tell but with truth and religious sincerity that i am and ever will be  dear sir yours etc  to the same the same reason that hindered your writing hindered mine the pleasing expectation to see you in town indeed since the willing confinement i have lain under here with my mother whom it is natural and reasonable i should rejoice with as well as grieve i could the better bear your absense from london for i could hardly have seen you there and it would not have been quite reasonable to have drawn you to a sick room hither from the first embraces of your friends my mother is now i thank god wondersully recovered though not so much as yet to venture out of her chamber yet enough to enjoy a few particular friends when they have the good nature to look upon her i may recommend to you the room we sit in upon one and that a favorite account that it is the very warmest in the house we and our fires will equally smile upon your face there is a persian proverb that says i think very prettily the conversation of a friend brightens the eyes this i take to be a splendour still more agreeable than the fires you so delightfully describe  that you may long enjoy your own fireside in the metaphorical sense that is all those of your family who make it pleasing to sit and spend whole wintry months together a far more rational delight and better selt by an honest heart than all the glaring entertainments numerous lights and false splendors of an assembly of empty heads aching hearts and false faces this is my sincere wish to you and yours  you say you propose much pleasure in seeing some few faces about town of my acquaintance i guess you mean mrs howaras and mrs blounts and i assure you you ought to take as much pleasure in their hearts if they are what they sometimes express with regard to you  believe me dear sir to you all a very faithful servant  to the same october  0 dear sir i was upon the point of taking a much greater journey than to bermudas even to that undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller returns  a fever carried me on the high gallop toward it for six or seven days  but here you have me now and that is all i shall say of it since which time an impertinent lameness kept me at home twice as long as if fate should say after the other dangerons illness you shall neither go into the other world nor any where you like in this else who knows but i had been at homlacy  i conspire in your sentiments emulate your pleasures wish for your company you are all of one heart and one soul as was said of the primitive christians it is like the kingdom of the just upon earth not a wicked wretch to interrupt you but a set of trvd experienced friends and fellow comforters who have seen evil men and evil days and have by a superior rectitude of heart set yourselves above them and reap your reward why will you ever of your own accord end such a millenary year in london transmigrate if i may so call it into other creatures in that scene of folly militant when you may reign for ever at homlacy in sense and reason triumphant i appeal to a third lady in your family whom i take to be the most innocent and the least warped by idle fashion and custom of you all i appeal to her if you are not every soul of you better people better companions and happier where you are i desire her opinion under her hand in your next letter i mean miss scudamores afterward duchess of beaufort at this time about  years old  i am confident if she would or durst speak her sense and employ that reasoning which god has given her to infuse more thoughtfulness into you all those arguments could not fail to put you to the blush and keep you out of town like people sensible of your own felicities i am not without hopes if she can detain a parliament man and a lady of quality from the world one winter that i may come upon you with such irresistible arguments another year as may carry you all with me to bermudas about this time the rev dean berkly conceived his project of erecting a settlement in bermuda for the propagation of the christian faith and of sciences in america the seat of all earthly happiness and the new jerusalem of the righteous  dont talk of the decay of the year the season is good where the people are so it is the best time of the year for a painter there is more variety of colors in the leaves the prospects begin to open through the thinner woods over the valleys and through the high canopies of trees to the higher arch of heaven the dews of the morning impearl every thorn and scatter diamonds on the verdant mantle of the earth the frosts are fresh and wholesome what would ye have the moon shines too though not for lovers these cold nights but for astronomers  have ye not reflecting telescopes these instruments were just then brought to perfection whereby ye may innocently magnify her spots and blemishes content yourselves with them and do not come to a place where your own eyes become reflecting telescopes and where those of all others are equally such upon their neighbors stay you at least for what i have said before relates only to the ladies dont imagine i will write about any eyes but theirs stay i say from that idle busylooking sanhedrin where wisdom or no wisdom is the eternal debate not as it lately was in ireland an accidental one  if after all you will despise good advice and resolve to come to london here you will find me doing just the things i should not living where i should not and as worldly as idle in a word as much an antibermudanist as any body dear sir make the ladies know i am their servant you know i am  yours etc  to the same aug    i have been above a month strolling about in buckinghamshire and oxfordshire from garden to garden but still returning to lord cobhams with fresh satisfaction i should be sorry to see my lady scudamores till it has had the full advantage of lord bathursts improvements and then i will expect something like the waters of riskins and the woods of oakley together which without flattery would be at least as good as any thing in our world for as to the hanging gardens of babylon the paradise of cyrus and the sharawaggis of of china i have little or no ideas of em but i dare say lord bt has because they were certainly both very great and very wild i hope mrs mary digby is quite tired of his lordships extravagante bergerie and that she is just now sitting or rather inclining on a bank fatigued with over much dancing and singing at his unwearied request and instigation i know your love of ease so well that you might be in danger of being too quiet to enjoy quiet and too philosophical to be a philosopher were it not for the ferment lord b will put you into one of his lordships maxims is that a total abstinence from intemperance or business is no more philosophy than a total composition of the senses is repose one must feel enough of its contrary to have a relish of either but after all let your temper work and be as sedate and contemplative as you will i will engage you shall be fit for his lordship when you come to town in the winter folly will laugh you into all the customs of the company here nothing will be able to prevent your conversion to her but indisposition which i hope will be far from you i am telling the worst that can come of you for as to vice you are safe but folly is many an honest mans nay every goodhumored mans lot nay it is the seasoning of life and fools in one sense are the salt of the earth a little is excellent though indeed a whole mouthful is justly called the devil  so much for your diversions next winter and for mine i envy you much more at present than i shall then for if there be on earth an image of paradise it is in such perfect union and society as you all possess i would have my innocent envies and wishes of your state known you all which is far better than making you compliments for it is inward approbation and esteem my lord digby has in me a sincere servant or would have were there any occasion for me to manifest it  to the same sept  0      dear sir i am glad your travels delighted you improve you i am sure they could not you are not so much a youth as that though you run about with a king of sixteen and what makes him still more a child a king of frenchmen my own time has been more melancholy spent in an attendance upon death which has seized one of our family my poor old nurse my mother is something better though at her advanced age every day is a climacteric there was joined to this an indisposition of my own which i ought to look upon as a slight one compared with my mothers because my life is not of half the consequence to any body that here is is to me all these incidents have hindered my more speedy reply to your obliging letter  the article you enquire of is of as little concern to me as you desire it should namely the railing papers about the odyssey if the book has merit and since you like it it must it will extinguish all such nasty scandal as the sun puts an end to stinks merely by coming out  i wish i had nothing to trouble me more an honest mind is not in the power of any dishonest one to break it is peace there must be some guilt or consciousness which is inconsistent with it is own principles not but malice and injustice have their day like some poor shortlived vermin that die of shooting their own stings falsehood is folly says homer and liars and calumniators at last hurt none but themselves even in this world in the next it is charity to say god have mercy on them they were the devils vicegerents upon earth who is the father of lies and i fear has a right to dispose of his children  i have had an occasion to make these reflections of late more justly than from any thing that concerns my writings for it is one that concerns my morals and which i ought to be as tender of as my own the good character of another very innocent person who i am sure shares your friendship no less than i do  no creature has better natural dispositions or would act more rightly or reasonably in every duty did she act by herself or from herself but you know it is the misfortune of that family to be governed like a ship i mean the head guided by the tail and that by every wind that blows in it  to the same december         dear sir it is now the season to wish you a good end of one year and a happy beginning of another but both these you know how to make yourself by only continuing such a life as you have been long accustomed to lead as for good works they are things i dare not name either to those that do them or to those that do them not the first are too modest and the latter too selfish to bear the mention of what are become either too old fashioned or too private to constitute any part of the vanity or reputation of the present age however it were to be wished people would now and then look upon good works as they do upon old wardrobes merely in case any of em should by chance come into fashion again as ancient fardingales revive in modern hoopd petticoats which may be properly compared to charities as they cover a multitude of sins  they tell me that at  certain antiquated charities and obsolete devotions are yet subsisting that a thing called christian cheerfulness not incompatible with christmas pyes and plumbbroth whereof frequent is the mention in old sermons and almanacks is really kept alive and in practice that feeding the hungry and giving alms to the poor do yet make a part of good housekeeping in a latitude not more remote from london than fourscore miles and lastly that prayers and roastbeef actually make some people as happy as a whore and a bottle but here in town i assure you men women and children i have done with these things charity not only begins but ends at home instead of the four cardinal virtues now reign four princely ones we have cunning for prudence rapine for justice timeserving for fortitude and luxury for temperance whatever you may fancy where you live in a state of ignorance and see nothing but quiet religion and good humor the case is just as i tell you where people understand the world and know how to live with credit and glory  i wish that heaven would open the eyes of men and make em sensible which of these is right whether upon a due conviction we are to quit faction and gaming and highfeeding and whoring and take to your country way or you to leave prayers and almsgiving and reading and exercise and come into our measures i wish i say that this matter were as clear to all men as it is to  your affectionate etc  letters to edward blount esquire from      to      to edward blount esquire jan           dear sir i know of nothing that will be so interessing to you at present as some circumstances of the last act of that eminent comic poet and our friend wycherley he had often told me as i doubt not he did all his acquaintance that he would marry as soon as his life was despaired of accordingly a few days before his death he underwent the ceremony and joined together those two sacraments which wise men say should be the last we receive for if you observe matrimony is placed after extreme unction in our catechism as a kind of hint of the order of time in which they are to be taken the old man then lay down satisfied in the conscience of having by this one act paid his just debts obliged a woman who he was told had merit and shown a heroic resentment of the ill usage of his next heir some hundred pounds which he had with the lady discharged those debts a jointure of four hundred a year made her a recompense and the nephew he left to comfort himself as well as he could with the miserable remains of a mortgaged estate i saw our friend twice after this was done less peevish in his sickness than he used to be in his health neither much afraid of dying nor which in him had been more likely much ashamed of marrying the evening before he expired he called his young wife to the bedside and earnestly entreated her not to deny him one request the last he should make upon her assurances of consenting to it he told her my dear it is only this that you will never marry an old man again i cannot help remarking that sickness which often destroys both wit and wisdom yet seldom has power to remove that talent which we call humor mr wycherley showed his even in this last compliment though i think his request a little hard for why should he bar her from doubling her jointure on the same easy terms  so trivial as these circumstances are i should not be displeased myself to know such trifles when they concern or characterise any eminent person the wisest and wittiest of men are seldom wiser or wittier than others in these sober moments at least our friend ended much in the character he had lived in and horaces rule for a play may as well be applied to him as a playwright  servetur ad imum qualis ab inceptu processerit and sibi constet   i am etc  to the same feb  0        dear sir i am just returned from the country whither mr row accompanied me and passed a week in the forest i need not tell you how much a man of his turn entertained me but i must acquaint you there is a vivacity and gaiety of disposition almost peculiar to him which make it impossible to part from him without that uneasiness which generally succeeds all our pleasures i have been just taking a solitary walk by moonshine full of reflections on the transitory nature of all human delights and giving my thoughts a loose in the contemplation of those satisfactions which probably we may hereafter taste in the company of separate spirits when we shall range the walks above and perhaps gaze on this world at as vast a distance as we now do on those worlds the pleasures we are to enjoy in that conversation must undoubtedly be of a nobler kind and not unlikely may proceed from the discoveries each shall communicate to another of god and of nature for the happiness of minds can surely be nothing but knowledge  the highest gratification we receive from company is mirth which at the best is but a fluttering unquiet motion that beats about the breast for a few moments and after leaves it void and empty  keeping good company even the best is but a less shameful art of losing time  what we here call science and study are little better the greater number of arts to which we apply ourselves are mere groping in the dark and even the search of our most important concerns in a future being is but a needless anxious and uncertain haste to be knowing sooner than we can what without all this solicitude we shall know a little later we are but curious impertinents in the case of futurity it is not our business to be guessing what the state of souls shall be but to be doing what may make our own state happy we cannot be knowing but we can be virtuous  if this be my notion of a great part of that high science divinity you will be so civil as to imagine i lay no mighty stress upon the rest even of my darling poetry i really make no other use than horses of the bells that gingle about their ears though now and then they toss their heads as if they were proud of em only to jogg on a little more merrily  your observations on the narrow conceptions of mankind in the point of friendship confirm me in what i was so fortunate as at my first knowledge of you to hope and since so amply to experience let me take so much decent pride and dignity upon me as to tell you that but for opinions like these which i discovered in your mind i had never made the trial i have done which has succeeded so much to mine and i believe not less to your satisfaction for if i know you right your pleasure is greater in obliging me than i can feel on my part till it falls in my power to oblige you  your remark that the variety of opinion in politics or religion is often rather a gratification than objection to people who have sense enough to consider the beautiful order of nature in her variations makes me think you have not construed joannes secundus wrong in the verse which precedes that which you quote been nota fides as i take it does no way signify the roman catholic religion though secundus was of it i think it was generous thought and one that flowed from an exalted mind that it was not improbable but god might be delighted with the various methods of worshipping him which divided the whole world i am pretty sure you and i should no more make good inquisitors to the modern tyrants in faith than we could have been qualified for lictors to procrustes when he converted refractory members with the rack in a word i can only repeat to you what i think i have formerly said that i as little fear god will damn a man who has charity as i hope that any priest can save him without it  i am etc  to the same march  0        dear sir i find that a real concern is not only a hindrance to speaking but to writing too the more time we give our selves to think over ones own or a friends unhappiness the more unable we grow to express the grief that proceeds from it it is as natural to delay a letter at such a season as this as to retard a melancholy visit to a person one cannot relieve one is ashamed in that circumstance to pretend to entertain people with trifling insignificant affectations of sorrow on the one hand or unseasonable and forced gayeties on the other it is a kind of profanation of things sacred to treat so solemn a matter as a generous voluntary suffering with compliments or heroic gallantries such a mind as yours has no need of being spirited up into honor or like a weak woman praised into an opinion of its own virtue it is enough to do and suffer what we ought and men should know that the noble power of suffering bravely is as far above that of enterprizing greatly as an unblemished conscience and inflexible resolution are above an accidental flow of spirits or a sudden tide of blood if the whole religious business of mankind be included in resignation to our maker and charity to our fellow creatures there are now some people who give us the opportunity of affording as bright an example in practicing the one as themselves have given an infamous instance of the violation of the other whoever is really brave has always this comfort when he is oppressed that he knows himself to be superior to those who injure him for the greatest power on earth can no sooner do him that injury but the brave man can make himself greater by forgiving it  if it were generous to seek for alleviating consolations in a calamity of so much glory one might say that to be ruined thus in the gross with a whole people is but like perishing in the general conflagration where nothing we can value is left behind us  methinks in our present condition the most heroic thing we are left capable of doing is to endeavor to lighten each others load and oppressed as we are to succor such as are yet more oppressed if there are too many who cannot be assisted but by what we cannot give our money there are yet others who may be relieved by our counsel by our countenance and even by our cheerfulness the misfortunes of private families the misunderstandings of people whom distresses make suspicious the coldnesses of relations whom change of religion may dis unite or the necessities of halfruind estates render unkind to each other these at least may be softened in some degrees by a general wellmanagd humanity among ourselves if all those who have your principles of belief had also your sense and conduct but indeed most of em have given lamentable this was written in the year of the affair of preston proofs of the contrary and it is to be apprehended that they who want sense are only religious through weakness and goodnatured through shame these are narrowminded creatures that never deal in essentials their faith never looks beyond ceremonials nor their charity beyond relations as poor as i am i would gladly relieve any distressed conscientious french refugee at this instant what must my concern then be when i perceive so many anxieties now tearing those hearts which i have desired a place in and clouds of melancholy rising on those faces which i have long looked upon with affection i begin already to feel both what some apprehend and what others are yet too stupid to apprehend i grieve with the old for so many additional inconveniences and chagrins more than their small remain of life seemed destined to undergo and with the young for so many of those gayeties and pleasures the portion of youth which they will by this means be deprived of this brings into my mind one or other of those i love best and among them the widow and fatherless late of  as i am certain no people living had an earlier and truer sense of others misfortunes or a more generous resignation as to what might be their own so i earnestly wish that whatever part they must bear may be rendered as supportable to them as it is in the power of any friend to make it  but i know you have prevented me in this thought as you always will in any thing that is good or generous i find by a letter of your ladys which i have seen that their ease and tranquillity is part of your care i believe there is some fatality in it that you should always from time to time be doing those particular things that make me enamored of you  i write this from windsor forest of which i am come to take my last look we here bid our neighbors adieu much as those who go to be hanged do their fellow prisoners who are condemned to follow them a few weeks after i parted from honest mr d with tenderness and from old sir william trumball as from a venerable prophet foretelling with lifted hands the miseries to come from which he is just going to be removed himself  perhaps now i have learnt so far as  nos dulcia linquimus arva my next lesson may be nos patriam fugimus    let that and all else be as heaven pleases i have provided just enough to keep me a man of honor i believe you and i shall never be ashamed of each other i know i wish my country well and if it undoes me it shall not make me wish it otherwise  to the same june         dear sir if a regard both to public and private affairs may plead a lawful excuse in behalf of a negligent correspondent i have really a very good title to it i cannot say whether it is a felicity or unhappiness that i am obliged at this time to give up my whole application to homer when without that employment my thoughts must turn upon what is less agreeable the violence madness and resentment of modern warmakers which are likely to prove to some people at least more fatal than the same qualities in achilles did to his unfortunate countrymen  though the change of my scene of life from windsor forest to the side of the thames be one of the grand aeras of my days and may be called a notable period in so inconsiderable a history yet you can scarce imagine any hero passing from one stage of life to another with so much tranquillity so easy a transition and so laudable a behavior i am become so truly a citizen of the world according to platos expression that i look with equal indifference on what i have lost and on what i have gained the times and amusements past are not more like a dream to me than those which are present i lie in a refreshing kind of inaction and have one comfort at least from obscurity that the darkness helps me to sleep the better i now and then reflect upon the enjoyment of my friends whom i fancy i remember much as separate spirits do us at tender intervals neither interrupting their own employments nor altogether careless of ours but in general constantly wishing us well and hoping to have us one day in their company  to grow indifferent to the world is to grow philosophical or religious whichsoever of those turns we chance to take and indeed the world is such a thing as one that thinks pretty much must either laugh at or be angry with but if we laugh at it they say we are proud and if we are angry with it they say we are illnatured so the most politic way is to seem always better pleased than one can be greater admirers greater lovers and in short greater fools than we really are so shall we live comfortably with our families quietly with our neighbors favored by our masters and happy with our mistresses i have filled my paper and so adieu  to the same sept        dear sir i think your leaving england was like a good mans leaving the world with the blessed conscience of having acted well in it and i hope you have received your reward in being happy where you are i believe in the religious country you now inhabit you will be better pleased to find i consider you in this light than if i compared you to those greeks and romans whose constancy in suffering pain and whose resolution in pursuit of a generous end you would rather imitate than boast of  but i had a melancholy hint the other day as if you were yet a martyr to the fatigue your virtue made you undergo on this side the water i beg if your health be restored to you not to deny me the joy of knowing it your endeavors of service and good advices to the poor papists put me in mind of noahs preaching forty years to those folks that were to be drowned at last at the worst i heartily wish your ark may find an ararat and the wife and family the hopes of the good patriarch land safely after the deluge upon the shore of totness  if i durst mix profane with sacred history i would cheer you with the old tale of brutus the wandering trojan who found on that very coast the happy end of his peregrinations and adventures  i have very lately read jeffery of monmouth to whom your cornwall is not a little beholden in the translation of a clergyman in my neighborhood the poor man is highly concerned to vindicate jefferys veracity as an historian and tole me he was perfectly astonished we of the roman communion could doubt of the legends of his giants while we believed those of our saints i am forced to make a fair composition with him and by crediting some of the wonders of corinaeus and gogmagog have brought him so far already that he speaks respectfully of st christophers carrying christ and the resuscitation of st nicholas tolentines chickens thus we proceed apace in converting each other from all manner of infidelity  ajax and hector are no more compared to corinaeus and arthur than the guelphs and ghibellines were to the mohocks of everdreadful memory this amazing writer has made me lay aside homer for a week and when i take him up again i shall be very well prepared to translate with belief and reverence the speech of achilless horse  you will excuse all this trifling or any thing else which prevents a sheet full of compliment and believe there is nothing more true even more true than any thing in jeffery is false than that i have a constant affection for you and am etc  p s i know you will take part in rejoicing for the victory of prince eugene over the turks in the zeal you bear to the christian interest though your cousin of oxford with whom i dined yesterday says there is no other difference in the christians beating the turks or the turks beating the christians than whether the emperor shall first declare war against spain or spain declare it against the emperor i must add another apothegm of the same noble earl it was the saying of a politic prince time and he would get the better of any two others to which lord oxford made this answer time and i against any two chance and i against time and you   to the same nov         dear sir the question you proposed to me is what at present i am the most unfit man in the world to answer by my loss of one of the best of fathers  he had lived in such a course of temperance as was enough to make the longest life agreeable to him and in such a course of piety as sufficed to make the most sudden death so also sudden indeed it was however i heartily beg of god to give me such an one provided i can lead such a life i leave him to the mercy of god and to the piety of a religion that extends beyond the grave si qua est ea cura etc  he has left me to the ticklish management of a narrow fortune where every false step is dangerous my mother is in that dispirited state of resignation which is the effect of long life and the loss of what is dear to us we are really each of us in want of a friend of such an humane turn as yourself to make almost any thing desirable to us i feel your absence more than ever at the same time i can less express my regards to you than ever and shall make this which is the most sincere letter i ever writ to you the shortest and faintest perhaps of any you have received it is enough if you reflect that barely to remember any person when ones mind is taken up with a sensible sorrow is a great degree of friendship i can say no more but that i love you and all that are yours and that i wish it may be very long before any of yours shall feel for you what i now feel for my father adieu  to the same rentcomb in gloucestershire oct        dear sir your kind letter has overtaken me here for i have been in and about this country ever since your departure i am pleased to date this from a place so well known to mrs blount where i write as if i were dictated by her ancestors whose faces are all upon me i fear none so much as sir christopher guise who being in his shirt seems as ready to combat me as her own sir john was to demolish duke lancastere i dare say your lady will recollect his figure i looked upon the mansion walls and terraces the plantations and slopes which nature has made to command a variety of valleys and rising woods with a veneration mixed with a pleasure that represented her to me in those puerile amusements which engaged her so many years ago in this place i fancied i saw her sober over a sampler or gay over a jointed baby i dare say she did one thing more even in those early times remembered her creator in the days of her youth  you describe so well your heremitical state of life that none of the ancient anchorites could go beyond you for a cave in a rock with a fine spring or any of the accommodations that befit a solitary only i dont remember to have read that any of those venerable and holy personages took with them a lady and begat sons and daughters you must modestly be content to be accounted a patriarch but were you a little younger i should rather rank you with sir amadis and his fellows if piety be so romantic i shall turn hermit in good earnest for i see one may go so far as to be poetical and hope to save ones soul at the same time i really wish myself something more that is a prophet for i wish i were as habakkuk to be taken by the hair of the head and visit daniel in his den you are very obliging in saying i have now a whole family upon my hands to whom to discharge the part of a friend i assure you i like em all so well that i will never quit my hereditary right to them you have made me yours and consequently them mine i still see them walking on my green at twickenham and gratefully remember not only their green gowns but the instructions they gave me how to slide down and trip up the steepest slopes of my mount  pray think of me sometimes as i shall often of you and know me for what i am that is  yours  to the same twickenham oct         dear sir your very kind and obliging manner of enquiring after me among the first concerns of life at your resuscitation should have been sooner answered and acknowledged i sincerely rejoice at your recovery from an illness which gave me less pain than it did you only from my ignorance of it i should have else been seriously and deeply affected in the thought of your danger by a fever i think it a fine and a natural thought which i lately read in a private letter of montaigne giving an account of the last words of an intimate friend of his adieu my friend the pain i feel will soon be over but i grieve for that you are to feel which is to last you for life  i join with your family in giving god thanks for lending us a worthy man somewhat longer the comforts you receive from their attendance put me in mind of what old fletcher of saltoune said one day to me alas i have nothing to do but to die i am a poor individual no creature to wish or to fear for my life or death it is the only reason i have to repent being a single man now i grow old i am like a tree without a prop and without young trees of my own shedding to grow round me for company and defense  i hope the gout will soon go after the fever and all evil things remove far from you but pray tell me when will you move toward us if you had an interval to get hither i care not what fixes you afterward except the gout pray come and never stir from us again do away your dirty acres cast em to dirty people such as in the scripture phrase possess the land shake off your earth like the noble animal in milton the tawny lion pawing to get free his hinder parts he springs as broke from bonds and rampant shakes his brinded main the ounce the lizard and the tiger as the mole rising the crumbled earth above them throw in hillocks   but i believe milton never thought these fine verses of his should be applied to a man selling a parcel of dirty acres though in the main i think it may have some resemblance for god knows this little space of ground nourishes buries and confines us as that of eden did those creatures till we can shake it loose at least in our affections and desires  believe dear sir i truly love and value you let mrs blount know that she is in the list of my memento domines famulorum famularumques etc my poor mother is far from well declining and i am watching over her as we watch an expiring taper that even when it looks brightest wastes fastest i am as you will see from the whole air of this letter not in the gayest nor easiest humor but always with sincerity  dear sir yours  to the same june         dear sir you may truly do me the justice to think no man is more your sincere wellwisher than myself or more the sincere wellwisher of your whole family with all which i cannot deny but i have a mixture of envy to you all for loving one another so well and for enjoying the sweets of that life which can only be tasted by people of good will  they from all shades the darkness can exclude and from a desert banish solitude torbay is a paradise and a storm is but an amusement to such people if you drink tea upon a promontory that overhangs the sea it is preferable to an assembly and the whistling of the wind better music to contented and loving minds than the opera to the spleenful ambitious diseased distasted and distracted souls which this world affords nay this world affords no other happy they who are banished from us but happier they who can banish themselves or more properly banish the world from them  alas i live at twickenham i take that period to be very sublime and to include more than a hundred sentences that might be writ to express distraction hurry multiplication of nothings and all the fatiguing perpetual business of having no business to do you will wonder i reckon translating the odyssey as nothing but whenever i think seriously and of late i have met with so many occasions of thinking seriously that i begin never to think otherwise i cannot but think these things very idle as idle as if a beast of burden should go on jingling his bells without bearing any thing valuable about him or ever serving his master  lifes vain amusements amidst which we dwell not weighed or understood by the grim god of hell said a heathen poet as he is translated by a christian bishop who has first by his exhortations and since by his example taught me to think as becomes a reasonable creature  but he is gone he carried away more learning than is left in this nation behind him but he left us more in the noble example of bearing calamity well it is true we want literature very much but pray god we dont want patience more if these precedents are to prevail  i remember i promised to write to you as soon as i should hear you were got home you must look on this as the first day i have been myself and pass over the mad interval unimputed to me how punctual a correspondent i shall henceforward be able or not able to be god knows but he knows i shall ever be a punctual and grateful friend and all the good wishes of such an one will ever attend you  to the same june        dear sir you show your self a just man and a friend in those guesses and suppositions you make at the possible reasons of my silence every one of which is a true one as to forgetfulness of you or yours i assure you the promiscuous conversations of the town serve only to put me in mind of better and more quiet to be had in a corner of the world undisturbed innocent serene and sensible with such as you let no access of any distrust make you think of me differently in a cloudy day from what you do in the most sunshiny weather let the young ladies be assured i make nothing new in my gardens without wishing to see the print of their fairy steps in every part of em i have put the last hand to my works of this kind in happily finishing the subterraneous way and grotto i there found a spring of the clearest water which falls in a perpetual rill that echoes through the cavern day and night from the river thames you see through my arch up a walk of the wilderness to a kind of open temple wholly composed of shells in the rustic manner and from that distance under the temple you look down through a sloping arcade of trees and see the sails on the river passing suddenly and vanishing as through a perspective glass when you shut the doors of this grotto it becomes on the instant from a luminous room a camera obscura on the walls of which all the objects of the river hills woods and boats are forming a moving picture in their visible radiations and when you have a mind to light it up it affords you a very different scene it is finished with shells interpersed with pieces of lookingglass in angular forms and in the ceiling is a star of the same material at which when a lamp of an orbicular figure of thin alabaster is hung in the middle a thousand pointed rays glitter and are reflected over the place there are connected to this grotto by a narrower passage two porches with niches and seats one toward the river of smooth stones full of light and open the other toward the arch of trees rough with shells flints and iron ore the bottom is paved with simple pebble as the adjoining walk up the wilderness to the temple is to be cockleshells in the natural taste agreeing not ill with the little dripping murmur and the aquatic idea of the whole place it wants nothing to complete it but a good statue with an inscription like that beautiful antique one which you know i am so fond of hujus nympha loci sacri custodia fontis dormio dum blandae sentio murmur aquae parce meum quisquis tangis cava marmora somnum rumpere seu bibas sive lavere tace nymph of the grot these sacred springs i keep and to the murmur of these waters sleep whoever thou art ah gently tread the cave ah bathe in silence or in silence lave   you will think i have been very poetical in this description but it is pretty near the truth i wish you were here to bear testimony how little it owes to art either the place itself or the image i give of it  i am etc  to the same sept         dear sir i should be ashamed to own the receipt of a very kind letter from you two whole months from the date of this if i were not more ashamed to tell a lie or to make an excuse which is worse than a lie for being built upon some probable circumstance it makes use of a degree of truth to falsity with it is a lie guarded your letter has been in my pocket in constant wearing till that and the pocket and the suit are worn out by which means i have read it forty times and i find by so doing that i have not enough considered and reflected upon many others you have obliged me with for true friendship as they say of good writing will bear reviewing a thousand times and still discover new beauties  i have had a fever a short one but a violent i am now well so it shall take up no more of this paper  i begin now to expect you in town to make the winter to come more tolerable to us both the summer is a kind of heaven when we wander in a paradisaical scene of nature among groves and gardens but at this season we are like our poor first parents turned out of that agreeable though solitary life and forced to look about for more people to help to bear our labors to get into warmer houses and hive together in cities  i hope you are long since perfectly restored and risen from your gout happy in the delights of a contented family smiling at storms laughing at greatness and merry over a christmasfire exercising all the functions of an old patriarch in charity and hospitality i will not tell mrs b what i think she is doing for i conclude it is her opinion that he only ought to know it for whom it is done and she will allow herself to be far enough advanced above a fine lady not to desire to shine before men  your daughters perhaps may have some other thoughts which even their mother must excuse them for because she is a mother i will not however suppose those thoughts get the better of their devotions but rather excite em and assist the warmth of them while their prayer may be that they may raise up and breed as irreproachable a young family as their parents have done in a word i fancy you all well easy and happy just as i wish you and next to that i wish you all with me  next to god is a good man next in dignity and next in value minuisti eum paullo minus ab angelis if therefore i wish well to the good and the deserving and desire they only should be my companions and correspondents i must very soon and very much think of you i want your company and your example pray make haste to town so as not again to leave us discharge the load of earth that lies on you like one of the mountains under which the poets say the giants that is the men of the earth are whelmed leave earth to the sons of earth your conversation is in heaven which that it may be accomplished in us all is the prayer of him who makes this short sermon value to you three pence adieu  letters of mr pope to mr gay from      to    0 nov         sir you writ me a very kind letter some months ago and told me you were then upon the point of taking a journey into devonshire that hindered my answering you and i have since several times inquired of you without any satisfaction for so i call the knowledge of your welfare or of any thing that concerns you i past two months in sussex and since my return have been again very ill i writ to lintot in hopes of hearing of you but had no answer to that point our friend mr cromwell too has been silent all this year i believe he has been displeased at some or other of my freedoms which i very innocently take and most with those i think most my friends but this i know nothing of perhaps he may have opened to you and if i know you right you are of a temper to cement friendships and not to divide them i really much love mr cromwell and have a true affection for your self which if i had any interest in the world or power with those who have i should not be long without manifesting to you i desire you will not either out of modesty or a vicious distrust of anothers value for you those two eternal foes to merit imagine that your letters and conversation are not always welcome to me there is no man more entirely fond of goodnature or ingenuity than my self and i have seen too much of those qualities in mr gay to be any thing less than his  most affectionate friend and real servant a pope binfield no         dec         dear sir it has been my good fortune within this month past to hear more things that have pleased me than i think almost in all my time beside but nothing upon my word has been so homefelt a satisfaction as the news you tell me of your self and you are not in the least mistaken when you congratulate me upon your own good success for i have more people to be happy out of than any illnatured man can boast i may with honesty affirm to you that notwithstanding the many inconveniences and disadvantages they commonly talk of in the res angusti domi i have never found any other than the inability of giving people of merit the only certain proof of our value for them in doing em some real service for after all if we could but think a little selflove might make us philosophers and convince us quantuli indiget natura ourselves are easily provided for it is nothing but the circumstantials and the apparatus or equipage of human life that costs so much the furnishing only what a luxurious man wants for horses and footmen a goodnatured man wants for his friends or the indigent  i shall see you this winter with much greater pleasure than i could the last and i hope as much of your time as your attendance on the duchess will allow you to spare to any friend will not be thought lost upon one who is as much so as any man i must also put you in mind though you are now secretary to this lady that you are likewise secretary to nine other ladies and are to write sometimes for them too he who is forced to live wholly upon those ladies favors is indeed in as precarious a condition as any he who does what chaucer says  for sustenance but they are very agreeable companions like other ladies when a man only passes a night or so with them at his leisure and away i am  your etc  aug         dear sir just as i received yours i was set down to write to you with some shame that i had so long deferred it but i can hardly repent my neglect when it gives me the knowledge how little you insist upon ceremony and how much a greater share in your memory i have than i deserve i have been near a week in london where i am like to remain till i become by mr jss help elegans formarum spectator i begin to discover beauties that were till now imperceptible to me every corner of an eye or turn of a nose or ear the smallest degree of light or shade on a cheek or in a dimple have charms to distract me i no longer look upon lord plausible as ridiculous for admiring a ladys fine tip of an ear and pretty elbow as the plaindealer has it but am in some danger even from the ugly and disagreeable since they may have their retired beauties in one trait or other about em you may guess in how uneasy a state i am when every day the performances of others appear more beautiful and excellent and my own more despicable i have thrown away three dr swifts each of which was once my vanity two lady bridgewaters a duchess of montague besides half a dozen earls and one knight of the garter i have crucified christ over again in effigy and made a madona as old as her mother st anne nay what is yet more miraculous i have rivaled st luke himself in painting and as it is said an angel came and finished his piece so you would swear a devil put the last hand to mine it is so begrimd and smutted however i comfort my self with a christian reflection that i have not broken the commandment for my pictures are not the likeness of any thing in heaven above or in earth below or in the waters under the earth neither will any body adore or worship them except the indians should have a sight of em who they tell us worship certain pagods or idols purely for their ugliness  i am very much recreated and refreshed with the news of the advancement of the fan which i doubt not will delight the eye and sense of the fair as long as that agreeable machine shall play in the hands of posterity i am glad your fan is mounted so soon but i would have you varnish and glaze it at your leisure and polish the sticks as much as you can you may then cause it to be born in the lands of both sexes no less in britain than it is in china where it is ordinary for a mandarine to fan himself cool after a debate and a statesman to hide his face with it when he tells a grave lie  i am etc  binfield may        dear gay since by your letter we find you can be content to breath in smoke to walk in crowds and divert your self with noise nay and to make fine pictures of this way of life we should give you up as one abandoned to a wrong choice of pleasures we have however so much compassion on you as to think of inviting you to us where your taste for books friendship and ease may be indulged but if you do not come pray leave to tempt us with your description of the court for indeed humanity is frail and we cannot but remember some particular honors which we have enjoyed in conversation bate us this one point and we stand you still untird with one another and fresh to the pleasures of the country if you would have any news from us know that we are well at present this i am sure would have been allowed by you as news from either of us a fortnight ago in return to this send us every thing you imagine diverting and pray forget not my commissions give my respects to the dean dr arbuthnot mr ford and the provost dear gay adieu  your affectionate friend and humble servant tho parnelle  dear mr gay above all other news send us the best that of your good health if you enjoy it which mr harcourt made us very much fear if you have any design either to amend your health or your life i know no better expedient than to come hither where you should not want room though i lay my self in a trucklebed under the doctor you might here converse with the old greeks be initiated into all their customs and learn their prayers by heart as we have done the doctor last sunday intending to say an our father was got half way in chryses prayer to apollo the ill effects of contention and squabling so lively described in the first iliad make dr parnelle and my self continue in the most exemplary union in every thing we deserve to be worshipped by all the poor divided factious interested poets of this world  as we rise in our speculations daily we are grown so grave that we have not condescended to laugh at any of the idle things about us this week i have contracted a severity of aspect from deep meditation on high subjects equal to the formidable front of blackbrowd jupiter and become an awful nod as well when i assent to some grave and weighty proposition of the doctor or enforce a criticism of my own in a word yg himself has not acquired more tragic majesty in his aspect by reading his own verses than i by homers  in this state i cannot consent to your publication of that ludicrous trifling burlesque you write about dr parnelle also joins in my opinion that it will by no means be well to print it  pray give with the utmost fidelity and esteem my hearty service to the dean dr arbuthnot mr ford and to mr fortescue let them also know at buttons that i am mindful of them i am divine bucoliast  thy loving countryman  oct    dear sir i have been perpetually troubled with sickness of late which has made me so melancholy that the immortality of the soul has been my constant speculation as the mortality of my body my constant plague in good earnest seneca is nothing to a fit of illness  dr parnelle will honor tonsons miscellany with some very beautiful copies at my request he enters heartily into our design i only fear his stay in town may chance to be but short dr swift much approves what i proposed even to the very title which i design shall be the works of the unlearned published monthly in which whatever book appears that deserves praise shall be depreciated ironically and in the same manner that modern critics take to undervalue works of value and to commend the high productions of grubstreet  i shall go into the country about a month hence and shall then desire to take along with me your poem of the fan to consider it at full leisure i am deeply engaged in poetry the particulars whereof shall be deferred till we meet  i am very desirous of seeing mr fortescue when he comes to town before his journey if you can any way acquaint him of my desire i believe his good nature will contrive a way for our meeting i am ever with all sincerity dear sir  your etc  sept         dear mr gay welcome to your native soil welcome to your friends thrice welcome to me whether returned in glory blessed with courtinterest the love and familiarity of the great and filled with agreeable hopes or melancholy with dejection contemplative of the changes of fortune and doubtful for the future whether returned a triumphant whig or a desponding tory equally all hail equally beloved and welcome to me if happy i am to share in your elevation if unhappy you have still a warm corner in my heart and a retreat at binfield in the worst of times at your service if you are a tory or thought so by any man i know it can proceed from nothing but your gratitude to a few people who endeavored to serve you and whose politics were never your concern if you are a whig as i rather hope and as i think your principles and mine as brother poets had ever a bias to the side of liberty i know you will be an honest man and an inoffensive one upon the whole i know you are incapable of being so much of either party as to be good for nothing therefore once more whatever you are or in whatever state you are all hail  one or two of your old friends complained they had heard nothing from you since the queens death i told em no man living loved mr gay better than i yet i had not once written to him in all his voyage this i thought a convincing proof how truly one may be a friend to another without telling him so every month but they had reasons too themselves to allege in your excuse as men who really value one another will never want such as make their friends and themselves easy the late universal concern in public affairs threw us all into a hurry of spirits even i who am more a philosopher than to expect any thing from any reign was born away with the current and full of the expectation of the successor during your journeys i knew not whither to aim a letter after you that was a sort of shooting flying add to this the demand homer had upon me to write fifty verses a day besides learned notes all which are at a conclusion for this year rejoice with me o my friend that my labor is over come and make merry with me in much feasting for i to thee and thou to me we will feed among the lilies by the lilies i mean the ladies with whom i hope you have fed to satiety have thou passed through many countries and not tasted the delights thereof have thou not left to thy issue in diverse lands that german gays and dutch gays may arise to write pastorals and sing their songs in strange countries are not the blouzelindas of the hague as charming as the rosalindas of britain or have the two great pastoral poets of our nation renounced love at the same time for philips immortal philips hanover philips has deserted yea and in a rustic manner kicked his rosalind  dr parnelle and i have been inseparable ever since you went we are now at the bath where if you are not as i heartily hope better engaged your coming would be the greatest pleasure to us in the world talk not of expenses homer shall support his children i beg a line from you directed to the posthouse in bath poor parnelle is in an ill state of health  pardon me if i add a word of advice in the poetical way write something on the king or prince or princess on whatsoever foot you may be with the court this can do no harm  i shall never know where to end and am confounded in the many things i have to say to you though they all amount but to this that i am entirely as ever  your etc  london nov        dear sir i am extremely glad to find by a letter of yours to mr fortescue that you have received one from me and i beg you to keep as the greatest of curiosities that letter of mine which you received and i never writ  but the truth is that we were made here to expect you in a short time that i was upon the ramble most part of the summer and have concluded the season in grief for the death of my poor father  i shall not enter into a detail of my concerns and troubles for two reasons because i am really afflicted and need no airs of grief and because they are not the concerns and troubles of any but my self but i think you without too great a compliment enough my friend to be pleased to know he died easily without a groan or the sickness of two minutes in a word as silently and peacefully as he lived  sic mihi contingat vivere sicque mori i am not in the humor to say gay things nor in the affectation of avoiding them i cannot pretend to entertain either mr pulteney or you as you have done both my lord burlington and me by your letter to mr lowndes i am only sorry you have no greater quarrel to mr lowndes and wish you paid some hundreds a year to the landtax that gentleman is lately become an inoffensive person to me too so that we may join heartily in our addresses to him and like true patriots rejoice in all that good done to the nation and government to which we contribute nothing our selves  i should not forget to acknowledge your letter sent from aix you told me then that writing was not good with the waters and i find since you are of my opinion that it is as bad without the waters but i fancy it is not writing but thinking that is so bad with the waters and then you might write without any manner of prejudice if you writ like our brotherpoets of these days  i have no story to tell that is worth your hearing you know i am no man of intrigue but the duchess of hamilton has one which she says is worth my hearing that relates to mr pulteney and your self and which she promises if you will not tell me she will her grace has won in a raffle a very fine tweezercase at the sight of which my tweezercase and all other tweezercases on the globe hide their diminished heads  that duchess lord warwick lord stanhope mrs bellenden mrs lepell and i cannot tell who else had your letters dr arbuthnot and i expect to be treated like friends i would send my services to mr pulteney but that he is out of favor at court and make some compliment to mrs pulteney if she were not a wig my lord burlington tells me she has as much outshind all the french ladies as she did the english before i am sorry for it because it will be detrimental to our holy religion if heretical women should eclypse those nuns and orthodox beauties in whose eyes alone lie all the hopes we can have of gaining such fine gentlemen as you to our church  your etc i wish you joy of the birth of the young prince because he is the only prince we have from whom you have had no expectations and no disappointments    dear sir i think it obliging in you to desire an account of my health the truth is i have never been in a worse state in my life and find whatever i have tried as a remedy so ineffectual that i give myself entirely over i wish your health may be set perfectly right by the waters and be assured i not only wish that and every thing else for you as common friends wish but with a zeal not usual among those we call so i am always glad to hear often from you always glad to see you whatever accidents amusements have intervened to make me do either less than usual i not only frequently think of you but constantly do my best to make others do it by mentioning you to all your acquaintance i desire you to do the same for me to those you are now with do me what you think justice in regard to those who are my friends and if there are any whom i have unwillingly deserved so little of as to be my enemies i dont desire you to forfeit their opinion or your own judgment in any case let time convince those who know me not that i am an inoffensive person though to say truth i dont care how little i am indebted to time for the world is hardly worth living in at least to one that is never to have health a week together i have been made to expect dr arbuthnot in town this fortnight or else i had written to him if he by never writing to me seems to forget me i consider i do the same seemingly to him and yet i dont believe he has a more sincere friend in the world than i am therefore i will think him mine i am his mr congreves and  your etc  london sept         dear gay i thank you for remembering me i would do my best to forget my self but that i find your idea is so closely connected to me that i must forget both together or neither i am sorry i could not have a glympse either of you or of the sun your father before you went for bath but now it pleases me to see him and hear of you pray put mr congreve in mind that he has one on this side of the world who loves him and that there are more men and women in the universe than mr gay and my lady duchess of m there are ladies in and about richmond that pretend to value him and your self and one of em at least may be thought to do it without affectation namely mrs howard as for mrs blounts whom you mercifully make mention of they are gone or going to sussex i hope mrs pulteney is the better for the bath though i have little charity and few good wishes for the ladies the destroyers of their best friends the men pray tell her she has forgot the first commissson i ever troubled her with and therefore it shall be the last the very thing i fear the desires dr arbuthnot is a strange creature he goes out of town and leaves his bastards at other folks doors i have long been so far mistaken in him as to think him a man of morals as well as of politics pray let him know i made a very unfashionable enquiry the other day of the welfare of his wife and family things that i presume are below the consideration of a wit and an omoreplayer they are in perfect health though mrs as navel has been burnt i hope the doctors own belly is in absolute ease and contentment now i speak of those regions about the abdomen pray dear gay consult with him and dr che e to what exact pitch yours may be suffered to swell not to outgrow theirs who are yet your betters pray tell dr arbuthnot that even pigeonpyes and hogspuddings are thought dangerous by our governors for those that have been sent to the bishop of rochester are opened and profanely pried into at the tower it is the first time dead pigeons have been suspected of carrying intelligence to be serious you and mr congreve nay and the doctor if he has not dined will be sensible of my concern and surprise at the commitment of that gentleman whose welfare is as much my concern as any friends i have i think my self a most unfortunate wretch i no sooner love and upon knowledge fix my esteem to any man but he either dies like mr craggs or is s nt to imprisonment like the bishop god send him as well as i wish him manifest him to be as innocent as i believe him and make all his enemies know him as well as i do that they may love him and think of him as well  if you apprehend this period to be of any danger in being addressed to you tell mr congreve or the doctor it is writ to them i am  your etc  july         dear sir i was very much pleased not to say obliged by your kind letter which sufficiently warmed my heart to have answered it sooner had i not been deceived a way one often is deceived by hearkening to women who told me that both lady burlington and yourself were immediately to return from tunbridge and that my lord was gone to bring you back the world furnishes us with too many examples of what you complain of in yours and i assure you none of them touch and grieve me so much as what relates to you i think your sentiments upon it are the very same i should entertain i wish those we call great men had the same notions but they are really the most little creatures in the world and the most interested in all but one point which is that they want judgment to know their greatest interest to encourage and choose honest men for their friends  i have not once seen the person you complain of whom i have of late thought to be as the apostle admonishes one flesh with his wife  pray make my sincere compliments to lord burlington whom i have long known to have more mind to be a good and honorable man than almost any one of his rank  i have not forgot yours to lord bolingbroke though i hope to have speedily a fuller opportunity he returns for flanders and france next month  mrs howard has writ you something or other in a letter which she says she repents she has as much goodnature as if she had never seen any ill nature and had been bred among lambs and turtledoves instead of princes and courtladies  by the end of this week fortescue will pass a few days with me we shall remember you in our potations and wish you a fisher with us on my grassplat in the mean time we wish you success as a fisher of women at the wells a rejoycer of the comfortless and widow an impregnator of the barren and a playfellow of the maiden i am  your etc  dear sir i faithfully assure you in the midst of that melancholy with which i have been so long encompassed in an hourly expectation almost of my mothers death there was no circumstance that rendered it more insupportable to me than that i could not leave her to see you your own present escape from so imminent danger i pray god may prove less precarious than my poor mothers can be whose life at her age can at best be but a short reprieve or a longer dying but i fear even that is more than god will please to grant me for these two days past her most dangerous symptoms are returned upon her and unless there be a sudden change i must in a few days if not in a few hours be deprived of her in the afflicting prospect before me i know nothing that can so much alleviate it as the view now given me heaven grant it may increase of your recovery in the sincerity of my heart i am excessively concerned not to be able to pay you dear gay any part of the debt i very gratefully remember i owe you on a like sad occasion when you was here comforting me in her last great illness may your health augment as fast as i fear it pleases god hers must decline i believe that would be very fast  may the life that is added to you be past in good fortune and tranquillity rather of your own giving to your self than from any expectations or trust in others  may you and i live together without wishing more felicity or acquisitions than friendship can give and receive without obligations to greatness  god keep you and three or four more of those i have known as long that i may have something worth the surviving my mother adieu dear gay and believe me while you live and while i live  your etc as i told you in my last letter i repeat it in this do not think of writing to me the doctor mrs howard and mrs blount give me daily accounts of you    sunday night dear sir i truly rejoiced to see your handwriting though i feared the trouble it might give you i wish i had not known that you are still so excessively weak every day for a week past i had hopes of being able in a day or two more to see you but my poor mother advances not at all gains no strength and seems but upon the whole to wait for the next cold day to throw her into a diarrhoea that must if it return carry her off this being daily to be feared makes me not dare to go a day from her lest that should prove to be her last god send you a speedy recovery and such a total one as at your time of life may be expected you need not call the few words i writ to you either kind or good that was and is nothing but whatever i have in my nature of kindness i really have for you and whatever good i could do i would among the very first be glad to do to you in your circumstance the old roman farewell is proper vive memor nostri  your etc i send you a very kind letter of mr digby between whom and me two letters have passed concerning you    dear gay no words can tell you the great concern i feel for you i assure you it was not and is not lessened by the immediate apprehension i have now every day jain under of losing my mother be assured no duty less than that should have kept me one day from attending your condition i would come and take a room by you at hampstead to be with you daily were she not still in danger of death i have constantly had particular accounts of you from the doctor which have not ceased to alarm me yet god preserve your life and restore your health i really beg it for my own sake for i feel i love you more than i thought in health though i always loved you a great deal if i am so unfortunate as to bury my poor mother and yet have the good fortune to have my prayers heard for you i hope we may live most of our remaining days together if as i believe the air of a better clime as the southern part of france may be thought useful for your recovery thither i would go with you infallibly and it is very probable we might get the dean with us who is in that abandoned state already in which i shall shortly be as to other cares and duties dear gay be as cheerful as your sufferings will permit god is a better friend than a court even any honest man is a better i promise you my entire friendship in all events heartily praying for your recovery  your etc do not write if you are ever so able the doctor tells me all    dear sir i am glad to hear of the progress of your recovery and the oftener i hear it the better when it becomes easy to you to give it me i so well remember the consolation you were to me in my mothers former illness that it doubles my concern at this time not to be able to be with you or you able to be with me had i lost her i would have been no where else but with you during your confinement i have now past five weeks without once going from home and without any company but for three or four of the days friends rarely stretch their kindness so far as ten miles my lord bolingbroke and mr bethel have not forgotten to visit me the rest except mrs blount once were contented to send messages i never passed so melancholy a time and now mr congreves death touches me nearly it is twenty years that i have known him every year carries away something dear with it till we outlive all tendernesses and become wretched individuals again as we begun adieu this is my birthday and this is my reflection upon it with added days if life give nothing new but like a sieve let every pleasure through some joy still lost as each vain year runs over and all we gain some sad reflection more is this a birthday  it is alas too clear it is but the funeral of the former year   i am yours etc  twicknam july    dear gay you have the same share in my memory that good things generally have i always know whenever i reflect that you should be in my mind only i reflect too seldom however you ought to allow me the indulgence i allow all my friends and if i did not they would take it in consideration that they have other avocations which may prevent the proofs of their remembering me though they preserve for me all the friendship and good will which i deserve from them in like manner i expect from you that my past life of twenty years may be set against the omission of perhaps one month and if you complain of this to any other it is you are in the spleen and not i in the wrong if you think this letter splenatick consider i have just received the news of the death of a friend whom i esteemed almost as many years as you poor fenton he died at easthamstead of indolence and inactivity let it not be your fate but use exercise i hope the duchess will take care of you in this respect and either make you gallop after her or teize you enough at home to serve instead of exercise abroad mrs howard is so concerned about you and so angry at me for not writing to you and at mrs blount for not doing the same that i am piqud with jealousy and envy at you and hate you as much as if you had a great place at court which you will confess a proper cause of envy and hatred in any poetmilitant or unpensiond but to set matters even i own i love you and own i am as i ever was and just as i ever shall be  yours etc  twickenham oct         dear sir i have many years ago magnified in my own mind and repeated to you a ninth beatitude added to the eight in the scripture blessed is he who expects nothing for he shall never be disappointed i could find in my heart to congratulate you on this happy dismission from all courtdependance i dare say i shall find you the better and the honester man for it many years hence very probably the healthfuller and the chearfuller into the bargain you are happily rid of many cursed ceremonies as well as of many ill and vicious habits of which few or no men escape the infection who are hackneydand tramelled in the ways of a court princes indeed and peers the lackies of princes and ladies the fools of peers will smile on you the less but men of worth and real friends will look on you the better there is a thing the only thing which kings and queens cannot give you for they have it not to give liberty which is worth all they have and which as yet i hope englishmen need not ask from their hands you will enjoy that and your own integrity and the satisfactory consciousness of having not merited such graces from them as they bestow only on the mean servile flattering interested and undeserving the only steps to their favor are such complacencies such compliances such distant decorums as delude them in their vanities or engage them in their passions he is their greatest favorite who is their falsest and when a man by such vile gradations arrives at the height of grandeur and power he is then at best but in a circumstance to be hated and in a condition to be hanged for serving their ends so many a minister has found it  i believe you did not want advice in the letter you sent by my lord grantham i presume you writ it not without and you could not have better if i guess right at the person who agreed to your doing it in respect to any decency you ought to observe for i take that person to be a perfect judge of decencies and forms i am not without fears even on that persons account i think it a bad omen but what have i to do with courtomens  dear gay adieu i can only add a plain uncourtly speech while you are no bodys servant you may be any ones friend and as such i embrace you in all conditions of life while i have a shilling you shall have sixpence nay eight pence if i can contrive to live upon a groat i am faithfully  your etc  aug    dear gay if my friendship were as effectual as it is sincere you would be one of those people who would be vastly advantaged and enriched by it i ever honored those popes who were most famous for nepotism it is a sign that the old fellows loved somebody which is not usual in such advanced years and i now honor sir robert walpole for his extensive bounty and goodness to his private friends and relations but it vexes me to the heart when i reflect that my friendship is so much less effectual than theirs nay so utterly useless that it cannot give you any thing not even a dinner at this distance nor help the general whom i greatly love to catch one fish my only consolation is to think you happier than myself and to begin to envy you which is next to hating an excellent remedy for love how comes it that providence has been so unkind to me who am a greater object of compassion than any fat man alive that i am forced to drink wine while you riot in water prepared with oranges by the hand of the duchess of queensberry that i am condemned to live on a highway side like an old patriarch receiving all guests where my portico as virgil has it mane salutantum totis vomit aedibus undam while you are rapt into the idalian groves sprinkled with rose water and live in burrage balm and burnet up to the chin with the duchess of queensberry that i am doomed to the drudgery of dining at court with the ladies in waiting at windsor while you are happily banished with the duchess of queensberry so partial is fortune in her dispensations for i deserved ten times more to be banished than you and i know some ladies who merit it better than even her grace after this i must not name any who dare do so much for you as to send you their services but one there is who exhorts me often to write to you i suppose to prevent or excuse her not doing it herself she seems for that is all i will say for a courtier to wish you mighty well another who is no courtier frequently mentions you and does certainly wish you well  i fancy after all they both do so  i writ to mr fortescue and told him the pains you took to see him dr a for all that i know may yet remember you and me but i never hear of it the dean is well i have had many accounts of him from irish evidence but only two letters these four months in both which you are mentioned kindly he is in the north of ireland doing i know not what with i know not whom cleland always speaks of you he is at tunbridge wondering at the superior carnivoracity of the dr he plays now with the old duchess of m nay dines with her after she has won all his money other news know i not but that counselor bickford has hurt himself and has the strangest walkingstaff i ever saw he intends speedily to make you a visit at amesbury i am my lord dukes my lady duchesss mr dormers general dormers and  your etc  sept       0 dear sir i may with great truth return your speech that i think of you daily oftener indeed than is consistent with the character of a reasonable man who is rather to make himself easy with the things and men that are about him than uneasy with those which are not and you whose absence is in a manner perpetual to me ought rather to be remembered as a good man gone than breathed after as one living you are taken from us here to be laid up in a more blessed state with spirits of a higher kind such i reckon his grace and her grace since their banishment from an earthly court to an heavenly one in each other and their friends for i conclude none but true friends will consort or associate with them afterward i cannot but look upon myself so unworthy as a man of twitnam seems to be ranked with such rectified and sublimated beings as you as a separated spirit too from courts and courtly fopperies but i own not altogether so divested of terrene matter nor altogether so spiritualized as to be worthy admission to your depths of retirement and contentment i am tugged back to the world and its regards too often and no wonder when my retreat is but ten miles from the capital i am within earshot of reports within the vortex of lies and censures i hear sometimes of the lampooners of beauty the calumniators of virtue the jokers at reason and religion i presume these are creatures and things as unknown to you as we of this dirty orb are to the inhabitants of the planet jupiter except a few fervent prayers reach you on the wings of the post from two or three of your zealous votaries at this distance as one mrs howard who lists up her heart now and then to you from the midst of the colluvies and sink of human greatness at wr one mrs b that fancies you may remember her while you lived in your mortal and too transitory state at petersham one lord b who admired the duchess before she grew quite a goddess and a few others  to descend now to tell you what are our wants our complaints and our miseries here i must seriously say the loss of any one good woman is too great to be born easily and poor mrs rollinson though a private woman was such her husband is gone into oxfordshire very melancholy and thence to the bath to live on for such is our fate and duty adeiu write to me as often as you will and to encourage you i will write as seldom as if you did not believe me  your etc  oct      0 dear sir i am something like the sun at this season withdrawing from the world but meaning it mighty well and resolving to shine whenever i can again but i fear the clouds of a long winter will overcome me to such a degree that any body will take a farthingcandle for a better guide and more serviceable companion my friends may remember my brighter days but will think like the irishman that the moon is a better thing when once i am gone i dont say this with any allusion to my poetical capacity as a son of apolio but in my companionable one if you will suffer me to use a phrase of the earl of clarendons for i shall see or be seen of few of you this winter i am grown too faint to do any good or to give any pleasure i not only as dryden fairly says feel my notes decay as a poet but feel my spirits flag as a companion and shall return again to where i first began my books i have been putting my library in order and enlarging the chimney in it with equal intention to warm my mind and body if i can to some life a friend a womanfriend god help me with whom i have spent three or four hours a day these fifteen years advised me to pass more time in my studies i reflected she must have found some reason for this admonition and concluded she would complete all her kindnesses to me by returning me to the employment i am fittest for conversation with the dead the old and the wormeaten  judge therefore if i might not treat you as a beatifyd spirit comparing your life with my stupid state for as to my living at windsor with ladies etc it is all a dream i was there but two nights and all the day out of that company i shall certainly make as little court to others as they do to me and that will be none at all my fairweatherfriends of the summer are going away for london and i shall see them and the butterflies together if i live till next year which i would not desire to do if it were only for their sakes but we that are writers ought to love posterity that posterity may love us and i would willingly live to see the children of the present race merely in hope they may be a little wiser than their parents  i am etc  to j gay esquire dec         i am astonished at the complaints occasioned by a late epistle to the earl of burlington and i should be afflicted were there the least just ground for em had the writer attacked vice at a time when it is not only tolerated but triumphant and so far from being concealed as a defect that it is proclaimed with ostentation as a merit i should have been apprehensive of the consequence had he satirized gamesters of a hundred thousand pounds fortune acquired by such methods as are in daily practice and almost universally encouraged had he overwarmly desended the religion of his country against such books as come from every press are publicly vended in every shop and greedily bought by almost every rank of men or had he called our excellent weekly writers by the same names which they openly bestow on the greatest men in the ministry and out of the ministry for which they are all unpunished and most rewarded in any of these cases indeed i might have judged him too presumptuous and perhaps have trembled for his rashness  i could not but hope better for this small and modest epistle which attacks no one vice whatsoever which deals only in folly and not folly in general but a single species of it that only branch for the opposite excellency to which the noble lord to whom it is written must necessarily be celebrated i fancied it might escape censure especially seeing how tenderly these follies are treated and really less accused than apologized for yet hence the poor are clothed the hungry fed health to himself and to his infants bread the labrer bears is this such a crime that to impute it to a man must be a grievous offense it is an innocent folly and much more beneficent than the want of it for ill taste employs more hands and diffuses expense more than a good one is it a moral defect no it is but a natural one a want of taste it is what the best good man living may be liable to the worthiest peer may live exemplarily in an illfavored house and the best reputed citizen be pleased with a vile garden i thought i say the author had the common liberty to observe a defect and to compliment a friend for a quality that distinguishes him which i know not how any quality should do if we were not to remark that it was wanting in others  but they say the satire is personal i thought it could not be so because all its reflections are on things his reflections are not on the man but his house garden etc nay he respects as one may say the persons of the gladiator amphitheatre the nile and the triton he is only sorry to see them as he might be to see any of his friends ridiculous by being in the wrong place and in bad company some fancy that to say a thing is personal is the same as to say it is unjust not considering that nothing can be just that is not personal i am afraid that all such writings and discourses as touch no man will mend no man the goodnatured indeed are apt to be alarmed at any thing like satire and the guilty readily concur with the weak for a plain reason because the vicious look upon folly as their frontier  jam proximus ardet ucalegon  no wonder those who know ridicule belongs to them find an inward consolation in removing it from themselves as far as they can and it is never so far as when they can get it fixed on the best characters no wonder those who are food for satirists should rail at them as creatures of  every beast born for our use would be ready to call a man so  i know no remedy unless people in our age would as little frequent the theaters as they begin to do the churches unless comedy were forsaken satire silent and every man left to do what seems good in his own eyes as if there were no king no priest no poet in israel  but i find myself obliged to touch a point on which i must be more serious it well deserves i should i mean the malicious application of the character of timon which i will boldly say they would impute to the person the most different in the world from a manhater and the person whose taste and encouragement of wit have often been shown in the rightest place the author of that epistle must certainly think so if he has the same opinion of his own merit as authors generally have for he has been favored by this very person  why in gods name must a portrait apparently collected from twenty different men be applied to one only has it his eye no it is very unlike has it his nose or mouth no they are totally differing what then i beseech you why it has the mole on his chin very well but must the picture therefore be his and has no other man that blemish  could there be a more melancholy instance how much the taste of the public is vitiated and turns the most salutary and seasonable physic into poison than if amidst the blaze of a thousand bright qualities in a great man they should only remark there is a shadow about him as what eminence is without i am confident the author was incapable of imputing any such to one whose whole life to use his own expression in print of him is a continued series of good and generous actions  i know no man who would be more concerned if he gave the least pain or offense to any innocent person and none who would be less concerned if the satire were challenged by any one at whom he would really aim it if ever that happens i dare engage he will own it with all the freedom of one whose censures are just and who sets his name to them  to the earl of burlington march        my lord the clamor raised about my epistle to you could not give me so much pain as i received pleasure in seeing the general zeal of the world in the cause of a great man who is beneficent and the particular warmth of your lordship in that of a private man who is innocent  it was not the poem that deserved this from you for as i had the honor to be your friend i could not treat you quite like a poet but sure the writer deserved more candor even from those who knew him not than to promote a report which in regard to that noble person was impertinent in regard to me villainous yet i had no great cause to wonder that a character belonging to twenty should be applied to one since by that means nineteen would escape the ridicule  i was too well content with my knowledge of that noble persons opinion in this affair to trouble the public about it but since malice and mistake are so long a dying i have taken the opportunity of a third edition to declare his belief not only of my innocence but of their malignity of the former of which my own heart is as conscious as i fear some of theirs must be of the latter his humanity feels a concern for the injury done to me while his greatness of mind can bear with indifference the insult offered to himself alludes to the letter the duke of ch wrote to mr pope on this occasion a copy of which together with mr popes to his grace we hope to procure for the next volume   however my lord i own that critics of this sort can intimidate me nay half incline me to write no more that would be making the town a compliment which i think it deserves and which some i am sure would take very kindly this way of satire is dangerous as long as slander raised by fools of the lowest rank can find any countenance from those of a higher even from the conduct shown on this occasion i have learnt there are some who would rather be wicked than ridiculous and therefore it may be safer to attack vices than follies i will therefore leave my betters in the quiet possession of their idols their groves and their high places and change my subject from their pride to their meanness from their vanities to their miseries and as the only certain way to avoid misconstructions to lessen offense and not to multiply illnatured applications i may probably in my next make use of real names and not of fictitious ones the he did in his next piece which was the epistle to the lord bathurst of the use of riches   i am my lord your faithful affectionate servant a pope  dr arbuthnot to mr pope hampstead july         dear sir i little doubt of your kind concern for me nor of that of the lady you mention i have nothing to repay my friends with at present but prayers and good wishes i have the satisfaction to find that i am as officiously served by my friends as he that has thousands to leave in legacies besides the assurance of their sincerity god almighty has made my bodily distress as easy as a thing of that nature can be i have found some relief at least sometimes from the air of this place my nights are bad but many poor creatures have worse  as for you my good friend i think since our first acquaintance there has not been any of those little suspicions or jealousies that often affect the sincerest friendships i am sure not on my side i must be so sincere as to own that though i could not help valuing you for those talents which the world prizes yet they were not the foundation of my friendship they were quite of another sort nor shall i at present offend you by enumerating them and i make it my last request that you continue that noble disdain and abhorrence of vice which you seem naturally endud with but still with a due regard to your own safety and study more to reform than chastise though the one often cannot be effected without the other  lord bathurst i have always honored for every good quality that a person of his rank ought to have pray give my respects and kindest wishes to the family my venison

leave behind in it for i do not know one thing for which i can envy london but for your continuing there yet i guess you will expect i should recant this expression when i tell you that sapho by which heathenish name you have christened a very orthodox lady did not accompany me into the country however i will confess myself the less concerned on that account because i have no very violent inclination to lose my heart especially in so wild and savage a place as this forest is in the town it is ten to one but a young fellow may find his strayed heart again with some wildstreet or drury lane damfel but here where i could have met with no redress from an unmerciful virtuous dame i must for ever have lost my little traveller in a hole where i could never rummage to find him again  well sir you have your lady in the town still and i have my heart in the country still which being wholly unemployd as yet has the more room in it for my friends and does not want a corner at your service  to be serious you have extremely obliged me by your frankness and kindness to me and if i have abused it by too much freedom on my part i hope you will attribute it to the natural openness of my temper which hardly knows how to show respect where i feel affection i would love my friend as my mistress without ceremony and hope a little rough usage sometimes may not be more displeasing to the one than it is to the other  if you have any curiosity to know in what manner i live or rather lose a life martial will inform you in one line the translation of which cost a friend of ours three in

spring which i very much desire you may perhaps instruct me to manage my game more wisely but at present i am satisfied to trifle away my time any way rather than let it stick by me as shopkeepers are glad to be rid of those goods at any rate which would otherwise always be lying upon their hands  sir if you will favor me sometimes with your letters it will be a great satisfaction to me on several accounts and on this in particular that it will show me to my comfort that even a wise man is sometimes very idle for so you must needs be when you can find leisure to write to  your etc  april      0  i have nothing to say to you in this letter but i was resolved to write to tell you so why should not i content myself with so many great examples of deep divines profound casuists grave philosophers who have written not letters only but whole tomes and voluminous treatises about nothing why should a fellow like me who all his life does nothing be ashamed to write nothing and that to one who has nothing to do but to read it but perhaps you will say the whole world has something to do something to talk of something to wish for something to be employed about but pray sir cast up the account put all these somethings together and what is the sum total but just nothing i have no more to say but to desire to give you my service that is nothing to your friends and to believe that i am nothing

your life and yet in his days he was styled lucius septimius severus pius pertinax augustus parthicus adiabenicus arabicus maximus  and what not what a prodigious waste of letters has time made what a number have here dropped off and lest the poor surviving seven unattended for my own part four are all i have to take care for and i will be judged by you if any man could live in less compass except

there is not so much danger in a poets being damned damnation follows death in other men but your damned poet lives and writes again   november     0  i have been so well satisfied with the country ever since i saw you that i have not so much as once thought of the town or inquired of any one in it besides mr wycherley and yourself and from him i understand of your journey this summer into leicestershire from whence i guess you are returned by this time to your old apartment in the widows corner to your old business of comparing critics and reconciling reconciling commentators and to the old diversions of a losing game at picquet with the ladies and half a play or a quarter of a play at the theater where you are none of the malicious audience but the chief of amorous spectators and for the infirmity of one his hearing sense which there for the most part could only serve to disgust you enjoy the vigor of another which ravishes you you know when one sense is suppressed it but retires into the rest   according to the poetical not the learned dodwell who has done one thing worthy of eternal memory wrote two lines in his life that are not nonsense so you have the advantage of being entertained with all the beauty of the boxes without being troubled with any of the dullness of the stage you are so good a critic that it is the greatest happiness of the modern poets that you do not hear their works and next that you are not so arrant a critic as to damn them like the rest without hearing but now i talk of those critics i have good news to tell you concerning myself for which i expect you should congratulate with me it is that beyond all my expectations and far above my demerits i have been most mercifully reprieved by the sovereign power of jacob tonson from being brought forth to public punishment and respited from time to time from the hands of those barbarous executioners of the muses whom i was just now speaking of it often happens that guilty poets like other guilty criminals when once they are known and proclaimed deliver themselves into the hands of justice only to prevent others from doing it more to their disadvantage and not out of any ambition to spread their fame by being executed in the face of the world which is a fame but of short continuance that poet were a happy man who could but obtain a grant to preserve his for ninetynine years for those names very rarely last so many days which are planted either in jacob tonsons or the ordinary of newgates miscellanies  i have an hundred things to say to you which shall be deferred till i have the happiness of seeing you in town for the season now draws on that invites every body thither some of them i had communicated to you by letters before this if i had not been uncertain were you passed your time the last season so much fine weather i doubt not has given you all the pleasure you could desire from the country and your own thoughts the best company in it but nothing could allure mr wycherley to our forest he continued as you told me long since he would an obstinate lover of the town in spite of friendship and fair weather therefore henceforward to all those considerable qualities i know you possessed of i shall add that of prophecy but i still believe mr wycherleys intentions were good and am satisfied that he promises nothing but with a real design to perform it how much soever his other excellent qualities are above my imitation his sincerity i hope is not and it is with the utmost that i am  sir etc jan      0   i had sent you the enclosed this was a translation of the first book of statius done when the author was but    years old as appears by an advertisement before the first edition of it in a miscellany publishd by b lintot  o     papers before this time but that i intended to have brought them myself and afterward could find no opportunity of sending them without suspicion of their miscarrying not that they are of the least value but for fear somebody might be foolish enough to imagine them so and inquisitive enough to discover those faults which i by your help would correct i therefore beg the favor of you to let them go no farther than your chamber and to be very free of your remarks in the margins not only in regard to the accuracy but to the fidelity of the translation which i have not had time of late to compare with its original and i desire you to be the more severe as it is much more criminal for me to make another speak nonsense than to do it in my own proper person for your better help in comparing it may be fit to tell you that this is not an entire version of the first book there is an omission from the    th line  jam murmura serpunt plebis agenoreae  to the    th  interea patriis olim vagus exul ab oris  between these these he since translated and they are extant in the printed version two statius has a description of the council of the gods and a speech of jupiter which contain a peculiar beauty and majesty and were left out for no other reason but because the consequence of this machine appears not till the second book the translation goes on from thence to the words hic vero ambobus rabiem fortuna cruentam where there is an odd account of a battle at fiftycuffs between the two princes on a very slight occasion and at a time when one would think the fatigue of their journey in so tempestuous a night might have rendered them very unfit for such a scuffle this i had actually translated but was very ill satisfied with it even in my own words to which an author cannot but be partial enough of conscience it was therefore omitted in this copy which goes on above eighty lines farther at the words  hic primum lustrare oculis etc  to the end of the book  you will find i doubt not that statius was none of the discreetest poets though he was the best versifier next virgil in the very beginning he unluckily betrays his ignorance in the rules of poetry which horace had already taught the romans when he asks his muse where to begin his thebaid and seems to doubt whether it should not be ab ovo ledaeo when he comes to the scene of his poem and the prize in dispute between the brothers he gives us a very mean opinion of it  pugna est de paupere regno  very different from the conduct of his master virgil who at the entrance of his poem informs his reader of the greatness of its subject  tantae molis erat romanam condere gentem bossu on epic poetry there are innumerable little faults in him among which i cannot but take notice of one in this book where speaking of the implacable hatred of the brothers he says the whole world would be too small a prize to repay so much impiety quid si peteretur crimine tanto limes uterque poli quem sol emissus eoo cardine aut portu vergens prospectat ibero   this was pretty well one would think already but he goes on  quasque procul terras obliquo sydere tangit avius aut boreae gelidas madidive tepentes igne noti after all this what could a poet think of but heaven itself for the prize but what follows is astonishing  quid si tyriae phrygiaeve sub unum convectentur opes   i do not remember to have met with so great a fall in any ancient author whatsoever i should not have insisted so much on the faults of this poet if i did not hope you would take the same freedom with and revenge it upon his translator i shall be extremely glad if the reading this can be any amusement to you the rather because i had the dissatisfaction to hear you have been confined to your chamber by an illness which i fear was as troublesome a companion as i have sometimes been to you in the same place where if ever you found any pleasure in my company it must surely have been that which most men take in observing the faults and follies of another a pleasure which you see i take care to give you even in my absence  if you will oblige me at your leisure with the confirmation of your recovery under your own hand it will be extreme grateful to me for next to the pleasure of seeing my friends is that i take in hearing from them and in this particular i am beyond all acknowledgments obliged to our friend mr wycherley who as if it were not enough to have excelled all men in wit is resolved to excel them in goodnature too i know i need no apology to you for speaking of mr wycherley whose example as i am proud of following in all things so in nothing more than in professing myself like him  your etc  may     0  you had long before this time been troubled with a letter from me but that i deferred it till i could send you either the jacob tonsons sixth volume of poetical miscellanies in which mr popes pastorals and some versions of homer and chaucer were first printed miscellany or my continuation of the version of statius the first i imagined you might have had before now but since the contrary has happened you may draw this moral from it that authors in general are more ready to write nonsense than booksellers are to publish it i had i know not what extraordinary flux of rhyme upon me for three days together in which time all the verses you see added have been written which i tell you that you may more freely be severe upon them it is a mercy i do not assault you with a number of original sonnets and epigrams which our modrn bards put forth in the springtime in as great abundance as trees do blossoms a very few whereof ever come to be fruit and please no longer than just in their birth so that they make no less haste to bring their flowers of wit to the press than gardeners to bring their other flowers to the market which if they cannot get off their hands in the morning are sure to die before night thus the same reason that furnishes covent garden with those nosegays you so delight in supplies the muses mercury and british apollo not to say jacobs miscellanies with verses and it is the happiness of this age that the modern invention of printing poems for pence apiece has brought the nosegays of parnassus to bear the same price whereby the publickspirited mr henry hills of blackfryars has been the cause of great ease and singular comfort to all the learned who never overabounding in transitory coin should not be discontented methinks even though poems were distributed gratis about the streets like bunyans sermons and other pious treatises usually published in a like volume and character  the time now drawing nigh when you use with sapho to cross the water in an evening to springgarden i hope you will have a fair opportunity of ravishing her  i mean only as oldfox in the plaindealer says through the ear with your wellpennd verses i have been told of a very lucky compliment of an officer to his mistress in the very same place which i cannot but set down and desire you at present to take it in good part instead of a latin quotation that it may some time or other be improved by your pronunciation while you walk solus cum sola in those amorous shades when at springgarden sapho deigns tappear the flowers march in hervan musk in her rear   i wish you all the pleasures which the season and the nymph can afford the best company the best coffee and the best news you can desire and what more to wish you than this i do not know unless it be a great deal of patience to read and examine the verses i send you and i promise you in return a great deal of deference to your judgment and an extraordinary obedience to your sentiments for the future to which you know i have been sometimes a little refractory if you will please to begin where you left off last and mark the margins as you have done in the pages immediately before which you will find corrected to your sense since your last perusal you will extremely oblige me and improve my translation besides those places which may deviate from the sense of the author it would be very kind in you to observe any deficiencies in the diction or numbers the hiatus in particular i would avoid as much as possible to which you are certainly in the right to be a professed enemy though i confess i could not think it possible at all times to be avoided by any writer till i found by reading malherbe lately that there is scarce any throughout his poems i thought your observation true enough to be passed into a rule but not a rule without exceptions nor that ever it had been reduced to practice but this example of one of the most correct and best of their poets has undeceived me and confirms your opinion very strongly and much more than mr drydens authority who though he made it a rule seldom observed it  your etc  june  0   0  i have received part of the version of statius and return you my thanks for your remarks which i think to be just except where you cry out like one in horaces art of poetry pulchre been recte there i have some fears you are often if not always in the wrong  one of your objections namely on that passage the rest revolving years shall ripen into fate may be well grounded in relation to its not being the exact sense of the words  see the first book of statius verse  0  caetera reliquo ordine ducam but the duration of the action of statiuss poem may as well be excepted against as many things besides in him which i wonder bossu has not observed for instead of confining his narration to one year it is manifestly exceeded in the very first two books the narration begins with oedipuss prayer to the fury to promote discord betwixt his sons afterward the poet expressly describes their entrlng into the agreement of reigning a year by turns and polynices takes his flight for thebes on his brothers refusal to resign the throne all this is in the first book in next tydeus is sent ambassador to etheocles and demands his resignation in these terms  astriferum velox jam circulus orbem torsit and amissae redierunt montibus umbrae ex quo frater inops ignota per oppida tristes exul agit casus    but bossu himself is mistaken in one particular relating to the commencement of the action saying in book   cap   that statius opens it with europas rape whereas the poet at most only deliberates whether he should or not  unde jubetis ire deae gentisne canam primordia dirae sidonios raptus etc but then expressly passes all this with a longa retro series  and says  limes mihi carminis esto oedipodae confusa domus  indeed there are numberless particulars blameworthy in our author which i have tried to soften in the version  dubiamque jugo fragor impulit oeten in latus and geminis vix fluctibus obstitit isthmus is most extravagantly hyperbolical nor did i ever read a greater piece of tautology than  vacua cum solus in aula respiceres jus omne tuum cunctosque minores et nusquam par stare caput   in the journey of polynices is some geographical error  in mediis audit duo litora campis could hardly be for the isthmus of corinth is full five miles over and caligantes abrupto sole mycaenas is not consistent with what he tells us in lib   lin  0  that those of mycaenae came not to the war at this time because they were then in confusion by the divisions of the brothers atreus and thyestes now from the raising the greek army against thees back to the time of this journey of polynices is according to statiuss own account three years  yours etc  july      0  the morning after i parted from you i found myself as i had prophesied all alone in an uneasy stagecoach a doleful change from that agreeable company i enjoyed the night before without the least hope of entertainment but from my last recourse in such cases a book i then began to enter into acquaintance with the moralists and had just received from them some cold consolation for the inconveniences of this life and the incertainty of human affairs when i perceived my vehicle to stop and heard from the side of it the dreadful news of a sick woman preparing to enter it it is not easy to guess at my mortification but being so well fortified with philosophy i stood resigned with a stoical constancy to endure the worst of evils a sick woman i was indeed a little comforted to find by her voice and dress that she was young and a gentlewoman but no sooner was her hood removed but i saw one of the finest faces i ever beheld and to increase my surprise heard her salute me by my name i never had more reason to accuse nature for making me shortsighted than now when i could not recollect i had ever seen those fair eyes which knew me so well and was utterly at a loss how to address myself till with a great deal of simplicity and innocence she let me know even before i discovered my ignorance that she was the daughter of one in our neighborhood lately married who having been consulting her physicians in town was returning into the country to try what good air and a new husband could do to recover her my father you must know has sometimes recommended the study of physic to me but i never had any ambition to be a doctor till this instant i ventured to prescribe some fruit which i happened to have in the coach which being forbidden her by her doctors she had the more inclination to in short i tempted and she eat nor was i more like the devil than she like eve having the good success of the foresaid gentleman before my eyes i put on the gallantry of the old serpent and in spite of my evil form accosted her with all the gaiety i was master of which had so good effect that in less than an hour she grew pleasant her color returned and she was pleased to say my prescription had wrought an immediate cure in a word i had the pleasantest journey imaginable  thus far methinks my letter has something of the air of a romance though it be true but i hope you will look on what follows as the greatest of truths that i think myself extremely obliged by you in all points especially for your kind and honorable information and advice in a matter of the utmost concern to me which i shall ever acknowledge as the highest proof at once of your friendship justice and sincerity at the same time be assured that gentleman we spoke of shall never by any alteration in me discover my knowledge of his mistake the hearty forgiving of which is the only kind of return i can possibly make him for so many favors and i may derive this pleasure at least from it that whereas i must otherwise have been a little uneasy to know my incapacity of returning to his obligations i may now by bearing his frailty exercise my gratitude and friendship more than himself either is or perhaps ever will be sensible of ille meos primus qui me sibi junxit amores abstulit ille habeat secum servetque sepulchro   but in one thing i must confess you have yourself obliged me more than any man which is that you have showed me many of my faults to which as you are the more an implacable enemy by so much the more you are a kind friend to me i could be proud in revenge to find a few slips in your verses which i read in london and since in the country with more application and pleasure the thoughts are very just and you are sure not to let them suffer by the versification if you would oblige me with the trust of any thing of yours i should be glad to execute any commissions you would give me concerning them i am here so perfectly at leisure that nothing would be so agreeable an entertainment to me but if you will not afford me that do not deny me at least the satisfaction of your letters as long as we are absent if you would not have him very unhappy who is very sincerely  your etc having a vacant space here i will fill it with a short ode on solitude which i found yesterday by great accident and which i find by the date was written when i was not twelve years old that you may perceive how long i have continued in my passion for a rural life and in the same employments of it happy the man whose wish and care a few paternal acres bound content to breathe his native air in his own ground whose herds with milk whose fields with bread whose flocks supply him with attire whose trees in summer yield him shade in winter fire blessed who can unconcerndly find hours days and years slide soft away in health of body peace of mind quiet by day sound sleep by night study and ease together mixed sweet recreation and innocence which most does please with meditation thus let me live unseen unknown thus unlamented let me die steal from the world and not a stone tell where i lie     august      0  if i were to write to you as often as i think of you my letters would be as bad as a rentcharge but though the one be but too little for your goodnature the other would be too much for your quiet which is one blessing goodnature should indispensably receive from mankind in return for those many it gives i have been informed of late how much i am indebted to that quality of yours in speaking well of me in my absence the only thing by which you prove yourself no wit or critic though indeed i have often thought that a friend will show just as much indulgence and no more to my faults when i am absent as he does severity to em when i am present to be very frank with you sir i must own that where i received so much civility at first i could hardly have expected so much sincerity afterward but now i have only to wish that the last were but equal to the first and that as you have omitted nothing to oblige me so you would omit nothing to improve me  i caused an acquaintance of mine to enquire twice of your welfare by whom i have been informed that you have left your speculative angle in the widows coffeehouse and bidding adieu for some time to all the rehearsals reviews gazettes etc have marched off into lincolnshire thus i find you vary your life in the scene at least though not in the action for though life for the most part like an old play be still the same yet no w and then a new scene may make it more entertaining as for myself i would not have my life a very regular play let it be a good merry farce a gds name and a fig for the critical unities yet on the other side i would as soon write like durfey as live like the whose beastly yet merry life is if you will excuse such a similitude not unlike a f  t at once nasty and laughable for the generality of men a true modern life is like a true modern play neither tragedy comedy nor farce nor one nor all of these every actor is much better known by his having the same face than by keeping the same character for we change our minds as often as they can their parts and he who was yesterday caesar is to day sir john daw so that one might ask the same question of a modern life that rich did of a modern play  pray do me the favor sir to inform me  is this your tragedy or your comedy   i have dwelt the longer upon this because i persuade myself it might be useful at a time when we have no other theater to divert ourselves at this great one here is a glorious standing comedy of fools at which every man is heartily merry and thinks himself an unconcerned spectator this to our singular comfort neither my lord chamberlain nor the queen herself can ever shut up or silence while that of drury alas lies desolate in the profoundest peace and the melancholy prospect of the nymphys yet lingering about its beloved avenues appears no less moving than that of the trojan dames lamenting over their ruined ilium what now can they hope disposiessd of their ancient seats but to serve as captives to the insulting victors of the haymarket the afflicted subjects of france do not in our postman so gnievously deplore the obstinacy of their arbitrary monarch as these perishing people of drury the obdurate heart of that pharaoh rich who like him disdains all proposals of peace and accommodation several libels have been secretly affixed to the great gates of his imperial palace in bridgesstreet and a memorial representing the distresses of these persons has been accidentally dropped as we are credibly informed by a person of quality out of his first minister the chief boxkeepers pocket at a late conference of the said person of quality and others on the part of the confederates and his theatrical majesty on his own part of this you may expect a copy as soon as it shall be transmitted to us from a good hand as for the late congress it is here reported that it has not been wholly ineffectual but this wants confirmation yet we cannot but hope the concurring prayers and tears of so many wretched ladies may induce this haughty prince to reason  i am etc  october      0  i may truly say i am more obliged to you this summer than to any of my acquaintance for had it not been for the two kind letters you sent me i had been perfectly oblitusque meorum obliviscendus and illis the only companions i had were those muses of whom tully says adolescentiam alunt senectutem oblectant secundas res ornant adversis perfugium ac solatium praebent delectant domi non impediunt foris pernoctant nobiscum peregrinantur rusticantur which indeed is as much as ever i expected from them for the muses if you take them as companions are very pleasant and agreeable but whoever should be forced to live or depend upon em would find himself in a very bad condition that quiet which cowley calls the companion of obscurity was not wanting to me unless it was interrupted by those fears you so justly guess i had for our friends welfare it is extremely kind in you to tell me the news you heard of him and you have delivered me from more anxiety than he imagines me capable of on his account as i am convinced by his long silence however the love of some things rewards itself as of virtue and of mr wycherley i am surpised at the danger you tell me he has been in and must agree with you that our nation would have lost in him alone more wit and probity than would have remained for ought i know in all the rest of it my concern for his friendship will excuse me since i know you honor him so much and since you know i love him above all men if i vent a part of my uneasiness to you and tell you that there has not been wanting one to insinuate malicious untruths of me to mr wycherley which i fear may have had some effect upon him if so he will have a greater punishment for his credulity than i could wish him in that fellows acquaintance the loss of a faithful creature is something though of ever so contemptible an one and if i were to change my dog for such a man as the aforesaid i should think my dog undervalud who follows me about as constantly here in the country as i was used to do mr wycherley in the town  now i talk of my dog that i may not treat of a worse subject which my spleen tempts me to i will give you some account of him a thing not wholly unprecedented since montaigne to whom i am but a dog in comparison has done the very same thing of his cat dic mihi quid melius desidiosus agam you are to know then that as it is likeness begets affection so my favorite dog is a little one a lean one and none of the finest shaped he is not much a spaniel in his fawning but has what might be worth any mans while to imitate from him a dumb surly sort of kindness that rather shows itself when he thinks me illusd by others than when we walk quietly and peaceably by ourselves if it be the chief point of friendship to comply with a friends motions and inclinations he possesses this in an eminent degree he lies down when i sit and walks when i walk which is more than many good friends can pretend to witness our walk a year ago in st jamess park  histories are more full of examples of the fidelity of dogs than of friends but i will not insist upon many of em because it is possible some may be almost as fabulous as those of pylades and orestes etc i will only say for the honor of dogs that the two most ancient and esteemable books sacred and profane extant  viz the scripture and homer have shown a particular regard to these animals that of toby is the more remarkable because there was no manner of reason to take notice of the dog besides the great humanity of the author homers account of ulyssess dog argus is the most pathetick imaginable all the circumstances considered and an excellent proof of the old bards goodnature ulysses had left him at ithaca when he embarked for troy and found him at his return after twenty years which by the way is not unnatural as some critics have said since i remember the dam of my dog was twentytwo years old when she died may the omen of longaevity prove fortunate to her successor you shall have it in verse  argus when wise ulysses from his native coast long kept by wars and long by tempests tossed arrived at last poor old disguised alone to all his friends and even his queen unknown changed as he was with age and toils and cares furrowed his reverend face and white his hairs in his own palace forced to ask his bread scorned by those slaves his former bounty fed forgot of all his own domestic crew the faithful dog alone his rightful master knew unfed unhousd neglected on the clay like an old servant now cashiered he lay touched with resentment of ungrateful man and longing to behold his ancient lord again him when he saw  he rose and crawled to meet it was all he could and fawned and kissed his feet seized with dumb joy  then falling by his side owned his returning lord looked up and died plutarch relating how the athenians were obliged to abandon athens in the time of themistocles steps back again out of the way of his history purely to describe the lamentable cries and howlings of the poor dogs they left behind he makes mention of one that followed his master across the sea to salamis where he died and was honored with a tomb by the athenians who gave the name of the dogs grave to that part of the island where he was buried this respect to a dog in the most polite people of the world is very observable a modern instance of gratitude to a dog though we have but few such is that the chief order of denmark now injuriously called the order of the elephant was instituted in memory of the fidelity of a dog named wildbrat to one of their kings who had been deserted by his subjects he gave his order this motto or to this effect which still remains wildbrat was faithful sir william trumbull has told me a story which he heard from one that was present king charles i being with some of his court during his troubles a discourse arose what sort of dogs deserved preeminence and it being on all hands agreed to belong either to the spaniel or greyhound the king gave his opinion on the part of the greyhound because said he it has all the goodnature of the other without the fawning a good piece of satire upon his courtiers with which i will conclude my discourse of dogs call me a cynick or what you please in revenge for all this impertinence i will be contented provided you will but believe me when i say a bold word for a christian that of all dogs you will find none more faithful than  your etc  april  0    0 i had written to you sooner but that i made some scruple of sending profane things to you in holy week besides our family would have been scandalized to see me write who take it for granted i write nothing but ungodly verses i assure you i am looked upon in the neighborhood for a very welldisposd person no great hunter indeed but a great admirer of the noble sport and only unhappy in my want of constitution for that and drinking they all say it is pity i am so sickly and i think it is pity they are so healthy but i say nothing that may destroy their good opinion of me i have not quoted one latin author since i came down but have learned without book a song of mr thomas durfeys who is your only poet of tolerable reputation in this country he makes all the merriment in our entertainments and but for him there would be so miserable a dearth of catches that i fear they would put either the parson or me upon making some for em any man of any quality is heartily welcome to the best topeingtable of our gentry who can roar out some rhapsodies of his works so that in the same manner as it was said of homer to his detractors what dares any man speak against him who has given so many men to eat meaning the rhapsodists who live by repeating his verses thus may it be said of mr durfey to his detractors dares any one despise him who has made so many men drink alas sir this is a glory which neither you nor i must ever pretend to neither you with your ovid nor i with my statius can amuse a whole board of justices and extraordinary squires or gain one hum of approbation or laugh of admiration these things they would say are too studious they may do well enough with such as love reading but give us your ancient poet mr durfey it is mortifying enough it must be confessed but however let us proceed in the way that nature has directed us  multi multa sciunt sed nemo omnia as it is said in the almanac let us communicate our works for our mutual comfort send me elegies and you shall not want heroicks at present i have only these arguments in prose to the thebaid which you claim by promise as i do your translation of pars me sulmo tenet  and the ring the rest i hope for as soon as you can conveniently transcribe em and whatsoever orders you are pleased to give me shall be punctually obeyed by  your etc  may  0    0 i had not so long omitted to express my acknowledgments to you for so much goodnature and friendship as you lately showed me but that i am but just returned to my own hermitage from mr caryls who has done me so many favors that i am almost inclined to think my friends infect one another and that your conversation with him has made him as obliging to me as yourself i can assure you he has a sincere respect for you and this i believe he has partly contracted from me who am too full of you not to overflow upon those i converse with but i must now be contented to converse only with the dead of this world that is to say the dull and obscure every way obscure in their intellects as well as their persons or else have recourse to the living dead the old authors with whom you are so well acquainted even from virgil down to aulus gellius whom i do not think a critic by any means to be compared to mr dennis and i must declare positively to you that i will persist in this opinion till you become a little more civil to atticus who could have imagined that he who had escaped all the misfortunes of his time unhurt even by the proscriptions of anthony and augustus should in these days find an enemy more severe and barbarous than those tyrants and that enemy the gentlest too the bestnaturd of mortals mr c whom i must in this compare once more to augustus who seemed not more unlike himself in the severity of one part of his life and the clemency of the other than you i leave you to reflect on this and hope that time which mollifies rocks and of stiff things makes limber will turn a resolute critic to a gentle reader and instead of this positive tremendous newfashiond mr c restore unto us our old acquaintance the soft beneficent and courteous mr c  i expect much toward the civilizing of you in your critical capacity from the innocent air and tranquillity of our forest when you do me the favor to visit it in the mean time it would do well by way of preparative if you would duly and constantly every morning read over a pastoral of theccritus or virgil and let the lady isabella put your macrobius and aulus gellius somewhere out of your way for a month or so who knows but traveling and long airing in an open field may contribute more successfully to the cooling a critics severity than it did to the asswaging of mr cheeks anger of old in these fields you will be secure of finding no enemy but the most faithful and affectionate of your friends etc  may       0 after i had recovered from a dangerous illness which was first contracted in town about a fortnight after my coming hither i troubled you with a letter and a paper enclosed which you had been so obliging as to desire a sight of when last i saw you promising me in return some translations of yours from ovid since when i have not had a syllable from your hands so that it is to be feared that though i have escaped death i have not oblivion i should at least have expected you to have finished that elegy upon me which you told me you was upon the point of beginning when i was sick in london if you will but do so much for me first i will give you leave to forget me afterward and for my own part will die at discretion and at my leisure but i fear i must be forced like many learned authors to write my own epitaph if i would be remembered at all monsieur de la fontaines would fit me to a hair but it is a kind of sacrilege do you think it is not to steal epitaphs in my present living dead condition nothing would be properer than oblitusque meorum obliviscendus and illis but that unluckily i cannot forget my friends and the civilities i received from yourself and some others they say indeed it is one quality of generous minds to forget the obligations they have conserrd and perhaps too it may be so to forget those on whom they conferred em then indeed i must be forgotten to all intents and purposes i am it must be owned dead in a natural capacity according to mr bickerstaff dead in a poetical capacity as a damned author and dead in a civil capacity as a useless member of the commonwealth but reflect dear sir what melancholy effects may ensue if dead men are not civil to one another if he who has nothing to do himself will not comfort and support another in his idleness if those who are to die themselves will not now and then pay the charity of visiting a tomb and a dead friend and strowing a sew flowers over him in the shades where i am the inhabitants have a mutual compassion for each other being all alike inanes and umbratiles we saunter to one anothers habitations and daily assist each other in doing nothing at all this i mention for your edification and example that tout plein du vie as you are yet you may not sometimes disdain  desipere in loco though you are no papist and have not so much regard to the dead as to address yourself to them which i plainly perceive by your silence yet i hope you are not one of those heterodox who hold them to be totally insensible of the good offices and kind wishes of their living friends and to be in a dull state of sleep without one dream of those they left behind them if you are let this letter convince you to the contrary which assures you i am still though in a state of separation  your etc p s this letter of deaths puts me in mind of poor mr bettertons over whom i would have this sentence of tully for an epitaph    vitae been actae jucundissima est recordatio june       0 it is very natural for a young friend and a young lover to think the persons they love have nothing to do but to please them when perhaps they for their parts had twenty other engagements before this was my case when i wondered i did not hear from you but i no sooner received your short letter but i forgot your long silence and so many fine things as you said of me could not but have wrought a cure on my own sickness if it had not been of the nature of that which is deaf to the voice of the charmer twas impossible you could have better timed your compliment on my philosophy it was certainly properest to commend me for it just when i most needed it and when i could least be proud of it that is when i was in pain it is not easy to express what an exaltation it gave to my spirits above all the cordials of my doctor and it is no compliment to tell you that your compliments were sweeter than the sweetest of his juleps and syrups but if you will not believe so much pour le moins votre compliment ma soulage dans ce moment et des qu on me lest venu fair jay chasse mon apoticaire et renvoye mon lavement   nevertheless i would not have you entirely lay aside the thoughts of my epitaph any more than i do those of the probability of my becoming ere long the subject of one for death has of late been very familiar with some of my size i am told my lord lumley and mr litton are gone before me and though i may now without vanity esteem myself the least thing like a man in england yet i cannot but be sorry two heroes of such a make should die inglorious in their beds when it had been a fate more worthy our size had they met with theirs from an irruption of cranes or other warlike animals those ancient enemies to our pygmaean ancestors you of a superior species little regard what befalls us homunciolos sesquipedales however you have no reason to be so unconcerned since all physicians agree there is no greater sign of a plague among men than a mortality among frogs i was the other day in company with a lady who rallied my person so much as to cause a total subversion of my countenance some days after to be revenged on her i presented her among other company the following rondeau on that occasion which i desire you to show sapho you know where you did despise the other day my little eyes little legs and little thighs and some things of little size you know where you it is true have fine black eyes taper legs and tempting thighs yet what more than all we prize is a thing of little size you know where   this sort of writing called the rondeau is what i never knew practiced in our nation and i verily believe it was not in use with the greeks or romans neither macrobius nor hyginus taking the least notice of it it is to be observed that the vulgar spelling and pronouncing it round o is a manifest corruption and by no means to be allowed of by critics some may mistakenly imagine that it was a sort of rondeau which the gallick soldiers sung in caesars triumph over gaul  gallias caesar subegit etc as it is recorded by suetonius in julio and so derive its original from the ancient gauls to the modern french but this is erroneous the words there not being ranged according to the laws of the rondeau as laid down by clement marot if you will say that the song of the soldiers might be only the rude beginning of this kind of poem and so consequently imperfect neither heinsius nor i can be of that opinion and so i conclude that we know nothing of the matter  but sir i ask your pardon for all this buffoonry which i could not address to any one so well as to you since i have found by experience you most easily forgive my impertinencies it is only to show you that i am mindful of you at all times that i write at all times and as nothing i can say can be worth your reading so i may as well throw out what comes uppermost as study to be dull i am etc  mr c to mr pope july       0 at last i have prevailed over a lazy humor to transcribe this elegy i have changed the situation of some of the latin verses and made some interpolations but i hope they are not absurd and foreign to my authors sense and manner but they are referred to your censure as a debt whom i esteem no less a critic than a poet i expect to be treated with the same rigor as i have practiced to mr dryden and you  hanc veniam petimusque damusque vicessim   i desire the favor of your opinion why priam in his speech to pyrrhus in the second aeneid says this to him at non ille satum quo te mentiris achilles   he would intimate i fancy by pyrrhuss answer only his degeneracy but then these following lines of the version i suppose from homers history seem absurd in the mouth of priam viz he cheered my sorrows and for sums of gold the bloodless carcass of my hector sold   i am your etc  mr popes answer july  0    0 i give you thanks for the version you sent me of ovids elegy it is very much an image of that authors writing who has an agreeableness that charms us without correctness like a mistress whose faults we see but love her with them all you have very judiciously altered his method in some places and i can find nothing which i dare insist upon as an error what i have written in the margins being merely guesses at a little improvement rather than criticisms i assure you i do not expect you should subscribe to my private notions but when you shall judge em agreeable to reason and good sense what i have done is not as a critic but as a friend i know too well how many qualities are requisite to make up the one and that i want almost all i can reckon up but i am sure i do not want inclination nor i hope capacity to be the other nor shall i take it at all amiss that another dissents from my opinion it is no more than i have often done from my own and indeed the more a man advances in understanding he becomes the more every day a critic upon himself and finds something or other still to blame in his former notions and opinions i could be glad to know if you have translated the   th elegy of lib   ad amican navigantem the  th of book   or the   th of book   which are above all others my particular favorites especially the last of these  as to the passage of which you ask my opinion in the second aeneid it is either so plain as to require no solution or else which is very probable you see farther into it than i can priam would say that achilles whom surely you only feign to be your father since your actions are so different from his did not use me thus inhumanly he blushed at his murder of hector when he saw my sorrows for him and restored his dead body to me to be buried to this the answer of pyrrhus seems to be agreeable enough go then to the shades and tell achilles how i degenerate from him granting the truth of what priam had said of the difference between them indeed mr drydens mentioning here what virgil more judiciously passes in silence the circumstance of achilless selling for money the body of hector seems not so proper it in some measure lessening the character of achilless generosity and piety which is the very point of which priam endeavors in this place to convince his son and to reproach him with the want of but the truth of this circumstance is no way to be questioned being expressly taken from homer who represents achilles weeping for priam yet receiving the gold iliad    for when he gives the body he uses these words o my friend patroclus forgive me that i quit the corpse of him who killed thee i have great gifts in ransom for it which i will bestow upon thy funeral  i am etc  mr c to mr pope aug      0 looking among some french rhymes i was agreeably surpised to find in the rondeau of in voitures poems pour le moins  your apoticaire and lavement which i took for your own so much is your muse of intelligence with the wits of all languages you have refined upon voiture whose ou vous scavez is much inferior to your you know where  you do not only pay your club with your author as our friend says but the whole reckoning who can form such pretty lines from so trivial a hint  for ovids amorum l   el    pars me sulmo etc my elegy it is confessed that the topography of sulmo in the latin makes but an awkward figure in the version your couplet of the dog star is very fine but may be too sublime in this place i laughed heartily at your note upon paradise for to make ovid talk of the garden of eden is certainly most absurd but xenophon in his oeconomicks speaking of a garden finely planted and watered as is here described calls it paradisos it is an interpolation indeed and serves for a gradation to the caelestial orb which expresses in some sort the sidus castoris in part caeli  how trees can enjoy let the naturalists determine but the poets make em sensitive lovers bachelors and married virgil in his georgicks lib   horace ode    lib   platanus caelebs evincet ulmos epod   ergo aut adulta vitium propagine altas maritat populos your critique is a very dolcepiccante for after the many faults you justly find you smooth your rigor but an obliging thing is owing you think to one who so much esteems and admires you and who shall ever be  your etc  august       0 your letters are a perfect charity to a man in retirement utterly forgotten of all his friends but you for since mr wycherley left london i have not heard a word from him though just before and once since i writ to him and though i know myself guilty of no offense but of doing sincerely just what he correcting his verses see the letters in   0  and the following years of mr wycherley and mr pope bid me  hoc mihi libertas hoc pia lingua dedit but the greatest injury he does me is the keeping me in ignorance of his welfare which i am always very sollicitous for and very uneasy in the fear of any indisposition that may befall him in what i sent you some time ago you have not verse enough to be severe upon in revenge for my last criticism in one point i must persist that is to say my dislike of your paradise in which i take no pleasure i know very well that in greek it is not only used by xenophon but is a common word for any garden but in english it bears the signification and conveys the idea of eden which alone is i think a reason against making ovid use it who will be thought to talk too like a christian in your version at least whatever it might have been in latin or greek as for all the rest of my remarks since you do not laugh at them as at this i can be so civil as not to lay any stress upon em as i think i told you before and in particular in the point of trees enjoying you have i must own sully satisfied me that the expression is not only defensible but beautiful i shall be very glad to see your translation of the elegy ad amicam navigantem as soon as you can for without a compliment to you every thing you write either in verse or prose is welcome to me and you may be confident if my opinion can be of any sort of consequence in any thing that i will never be unsincere though i may be often mistaken to use sincerity with you is but paying you in your own coin from whom i have experienced so much of it and i need not tell you how much i really esteem you when i esteem nothing in the world so much as that quality i know you sometimes say civil things to me in your epistolary style but those i am to make allowance for as particularly when you talk of admiring it is a word you are so used to in conversation of ladies that it will creep in to your discourse in spite of you even to your friends but as women when they think themselves secure of admiration commit a thousand negligences which show them so much at disadvantage and off their guard as to lose the little real love they had before so when men imagine others entertain some esteem for their abilities they often expose all their imperfections and foolish works to the disparagement of the little wit they were thought masters of i am going to exemplify this to you in putting into your hands being encouraged by so much indulgence some verses of my youth or rather childhood which as i was a great admirer of waller were intended in imitation of his manner and are perhaps such imitations as those you see in awkward country dames of the fine and wellbred ladies of the court if you will take em with you into lincolnshire they may save you one hour from the conversation of the country gentlemen and their tenants who differ but in dress and name which if it be there as bad as here is even worse than my poetry i hope your stay there will be no longer than as mr wycherley calls it to rob the country and run away to london with your money in the mean time i beg the favor of a line from you and am as i will never cease to be  your etc  october       0 i deferred answering your last upon the advice i received that you were leaving the town for some time and expected your return with impatience having then a design of seeing my friends there among the first of which i have reason to account yourself but my almost continual illnesses prevent that as well as most other satisfactions of my life however i may say one good thing of sickness that it is the best cure in nature for ambition and designs upon the world or fortune it makes a man pretty indifferent for the future provided he can but be easy by intervals for the present he will be content to compound for his quiet only and leave all the circumstantial part and pomp of life to those who have a health vigorous enough to enjoy all the mistresses of their desires i thank god there is nothing out of myself which i would be at the trouble of seeking except a friend a happiness i once hoped to have possessed in mr wycherley but  quantum mutalus ab illo  i have for some years been employed much like children that build houses with cards endeavoring very busily and eagerly to raise a friendship which the first breath of any illnatured bystander could puff away  but i will trouble you no farther with writing nor myself with thinking of this subject  i was mightily pleased to perceive by your quotation from voiture that you had trackd me so far as france you see it is with weak heads as with weak stomachs they immediately throw out what they received last and what they read floats upon the surface of their mind like oil upon water without incorporating this i think however cannot be said of the loveverses i last troubled you with where all i am afraid is so puerile and so like the author that no body will suspect any thing to be borrowed yet you as a friend entertaining a better opinion of em it seems searched in waller but searched in vain your judgment of em is i think very right  for it was my own opinion before if you think em not worth the trouble of correcting pray tell me so freely and it will save me a labor if you think the contrary you would particularly oblige me by your remarks on the several thoughts as they occur i long to be nibling at your verses and have not forgot who promised me ovids elegy ad amicam navigantem had ovid been as long composing it as you in sending it the lady might have sailed to gades and received it at her return i have really a great itch of criticism upon me but want matter here in the country which i desire you to furnish me with as i do you in the town sic servat sludii faedera quisque sui   i am obliged to mr caryl whom you tell me you met at epsom for telling you truth as a man is in these days to any one that will tell truth to his advantage and i think none is more to mine than what he told you and i should be glad to tell all the world that i have an extreme affection and estrem for you  tecum etenim longos memini consumere soles et tecum primas epulis decerpere noctes unum opus and requiem pariter disponimus ambo atque verecunda laxamus seria mensa by these epulae as i take it persius meant the portugal snuff and burned claret which he took with his master cornutus and the verecunda mensa was without dispute some coffeehouse table of the ancients  i will only observe that these four lines are as elegant and musical as any in persius not excepting those six or seven which mr dryden quotes as the only such in all that author  i could be heartily glad to repeat the satisfaction described in them being truly  your etc  october       0 i am glad to find by your last letter that you write to me with the freedom of a friend setting down your thoughts as they occur and dealing plainly with me in the matter of my own trifles which i assure you i never valued half so much as i do that sincerity in you which they were the occasion of discovering to me and which while i am happy in i may be trusted with that dangerous weapon poetry since i shall do nothing with it but after asking and following your advice i value sincerity the more as i find by sad experience the practice of it is more dangerous writers rarely pardoning the executioners of their verses even though themselves pronounce sentence upon them  as to mr philipss pastorals i take the first to be infinitely the best and the second the worst the third is for the greatest part a translation from virgils daphnis i will not forestal your judgment of the rest only observe in that of the nightingale these lines speaking of the musicians playing on the harp now lightly skimming over the strings they pass like winds that gently brush the plying grass and melting airs arise at their command and now laborious with a weighty hand he sinks into the cords with solemn pace and gives the swelling tones a manly grace   to which nothing can be objected but that they are too lofty for pastoral especially being put into the mouth of a shepherd as they are here in the poets own person they had been i believe more proper these are more after virgils manner than that of theocritus whom yet in the character of pastoral he rather seems to imitate in the whole i agree with the tatler that we have no better eclogues in our language there is a small copy of the same author published in the tatler no    on the danish winter it is poetical painting and i recommend it to your perusal  dr garths poem i have not seen but believe i shall be of that critics opinion you mention at wills who swore it was good for though i am very cautious of swearing after critics yet i think one may do it more safely when they commend than when they blame  i agree with you in your censure of the use of seaterms in mr drydens virgil not only because helenus was no great prophet in those matters but because no terms of art or cantwords suit with the majesty and dignity of style which epic poetry requires  cui mens divinior atque os magna soniturum  the tarpawlin phrase can please none but such qui aurem habent batavam they must not expect auribus atticis probari i find by you i think i have brought in two phrases of martial here very dexterously  though you say you did not rightly take my meaning in the verse i quoted from juvenal yet i will not explain it because though it seems you are resolved to take me for a critic i would by no means be thought a commentator  and for another reason too because i have quite forgot both the verse and the application  i hope it will be no offense to give my most hearty service to mr wycherley though i perceive by his last to me i am not to trouble him with my letters since he there told me he was going instantly out of town and till his return was my servant etc i guess by yours he is yet with you and beg you to do what you may with all truth and honor that is assure him i have ever borne all the respect and kindness imaginable to him i do not know to this hour what it is that has estranged him from me but this i know that he may for the future be more safely my friend since no invitation of his shall ever more make me so free with him i could not have thought any man had been so very cautious and suspicious as not to credit his own experience of a friend indeed to believe no body may be a maxim of safety but not so much of honesty there is but one way i know of conversing safely with all men that is not by concealing what we say or do but by saying or doing nothing that deserves to be concealed and i can truly boast this comfort in my affairs with mr wycherley but i pardon his jealousy which is become his nature and shall never be his enemy whatsoever he says of me  your etc  mr c to mr pope nov      0 i find i am obliged to the sight of your loveverses for your opinion of my sincerity which had never been called in question if you had not forced me upon so many other occasions to express my esteem  i have just read and compared pieces printed in the  th vol of tonsons miscellanies mr rows version of the  th of lucan with very great pleasure where i find none of those absurdities so frequent in that of virgil except in two places for the sake of lashing the priests one where cato says  sortilegis egeant dubii  and one in the simile of the haemorhois  fatidici sabaei  he is so errant a whig that he strains even beyond his author in passion for liberty and aversion to tyranny and errs only in amplification lucan in initio   ni describing the seat of the semidei manes says quodque patet terras inter lunaeque meatus semidei manes habitant  mr row has this line then looking down on the suns feeble ray pray your opinion if there be an errorsphaericus in this or no  yours etc  nov       0 you mistake me very much in thinking the freedom you kindly used with my loveverses gave me the first opinion of your sincerity i assure you it only did what every goodnatured action of yours has done since confirmed me more in that opinion the fable of the nightingale in philipss pastoral is taken from famianus stradas latin poem on the same subject in his prolusiones academicae only the tomb he erects at the end is added from virgils conclusion of the culex i cannot forbear giving you a passage out of the latin poem i mention by which you will find the english poet is indebted to it alternat mira art sides dum torquet acutas inciditque graves operoso verbere pulsat  jamque manu per fila volat simul hos simul illos explorat numeros chordaque laborat in omni  mox silet illa modis totidem respondit and artem art refert nunc ceu rudis aut incerta canendi praebet iter liquidum labenti e pectore voci nunc caesim variat modulisque canora minutis delibrat vocem tremuloque reciprocat ore   this poem was many years since imitated by crashaw out of whose verses the following are very remarkable from this to that from that to this he flies feels musicks pulse in all its arteries caught in a net which there apollo spreads his fingers struggle with the vocal threads   i have as i think i formerly told you a very good opinion of mr rows  th book of lucan indeed he amplifies too much as well as brebaeus the famous french imitator if i remember right he sometimes takes the whole comment into the text of the version as particularly in lin  0  utque solet pariter totis se essundere signis corycii pressura croci  and in the place you quote he makes of those two lines in the latin vidit quanta sub nocte jaceret nostra dies risitque sui ludibria trunci no less than eight in english  what you observe sure cannot be an error sphaericus strictly speaking either according to their ptolomaick or our copernican system tycho brahe himself will be on the translators side for mr row here says no more than that he looked down on the rays of the sun which pompey might do even though the body of the sun were above him  you cannot but have remarked what a journey lucan here makes cato take for the sake of his fine descriptions from cyrene he travels by land for no better reason than this haec eadem sua debat hyems quae clauserat aequor the winters effects on the sea it seems were more to be dreaded than all the serpents whirlwinds sands etc by land which immediately after he paints out in his speech to the soldiers then he fetches a compass a vast way round about to the nasamones and jupiter ammons temple purely to ridicule the oracles and labienus must pardon me if i do not believe him when he says  sors obtulit and fortuna viae  either labienus or the map is very much mistaken here thence he returns back to the syrtes which he might have taken first in his way to utica and so to leptis minor where our author leaves him who seems to have made cato speak his own mind when he tells his army  ire sat est  no matter whither i am  your etc  mr c to mr pope nov  0    0 the system of tycho brahe were it true as it is novel could have no room here lucan with the rest of the latin poets seems to follow plato whose order of the spheres is clear in cicero de natura deorum de somnio scipionis and in macrobius the seat of the semidei manes is platonic too for apuleius de deo socratis assigns the same to the genii viz the region of the air for their intercourse with gods and men so that i fancy row mistook the situation and i cannot be reconciled to look down on the suns rays i am glad you agree with me about the latitude he takes and wish you had told me if the sortilegi and fatidici could license his invectives against priests but i suppose you think them with helena undeserving of your protection i agree with you in lucans errors and the cause of em his poetic descriptions for the romans then knew the coast of africa from cyrene to the southeast of which lies ammon toward egypt to leptis and utica but pray remember how your homer nodded while ulysses slept and waking knew not where he was in the short passage from corcyra to ithaca i like trapps versions for their justness his psalm is excellent the prodigies in the first georgick judicious whence i conclude that it is easier to turn virgil justly in blank verse than rhyme the eclogue of gallus and fable of phaeton pretty well but he is very saulty in his numbers the fate of phaeton might run thus  the blasted phaeton with blazing hair shot gliding through the vast abyss of air and tumbled headlong like a falling star   i am your etc  mr popes answer nov       0 to make use of that freedom and familiarity of style which we have taken up in our correspondence and which is more properly talking upon paper than writing i will tell you without any preface that i never took tycho brahe for one of the ancients or in the least an acquaintance of lucans nay it is a mercy on this occasion tha i do not give you an account of h life and conversation as how he liv some years like an enchanted knight in a certain island with a tale of a king of denmarks mistress that shall be nameless  but i have compassion on you and would not for the world you should stay any longer among the genii and semidei manes you know where for if once you get so near the moon sapho will want your presence in the clouds and inferior regions not to mention the great loss drury lane will sustain when mr c is in the milky way these celestial thoughts put me in mind of the priests you mention who are a sort of sortilegi in one sense because in their lottery there are more blanks than prizes the adventurers being at best in an uncertainty whereas the settersup are sure of something priests indeed in their character as they represent god are sacred and so are constables as they represent the king but you will own a great many of em are very odd fellows and the devil a bit of likeness in em yet i can assure you i honor the good as much as i detest the bad and i think that in condemning these we praise those i am so far from esteeming even the worst unworthy of my protection that i have defended their character in congreves and vanbrughs plays even against their own brethren and so much for priests in general now for trapp in particular whose translations from ovid i have not so good an opinion of as you not i will assure you from any sort of prejudice to him as a priest but because i think he has little of the main characteristick of his author a graceful easiness for let the sense be ever so exactly rendered unless an author looks like himself in his air habit manner it is a disguise and not a translation but as to the psalm i think david is much more beholden to him than ovid and as he treated the roman like a jew so he has made the jew speak like a roman  your etc  mr c to mr pope december      0 the same judgment we made on rows  th of lucan will serve for his part of the  th where i find this memorable line parque novum fortuna videt concurrere bellum atque virum for this he employs six verses among which is this as if on knightly terms in lists they ran pray can you trace chivalry up higher than pharamond will you allow it an anachronism  tickell in his version of the phoenix from claudian when nature ceases thou shall still remain nor second chaos bound thy endless reign claudian thus et clades te nulla rapit solusque supersles edom ta tellure manes  which plainly resers to the deluge of deucalion and the conflagration of phaeton not to the final dissolution you thought of the priests lottery is very fine you play the wit and not the critic upon the errors of your brother  your observations are all very just virgil is eminent for adjusting his diction to his sentiments and among the moderns i find your practice the prosodia of your rules your to a lady with the works of voiture poem shows you to be what you say of voiture with books wellbred the state of the fair though satirical is touched with that delicacy and gallantry that not the court of augustus nor  but hold i shall lose what i lately recovered your opinion of my sincerity yet i must say it is as faultless as the fair to whom it is addressed be she never so perfect the m g who it seems had no right notion of you as you of him transcribed it by lucubration from some discourse of yours he thought your inclination led you to what the men of fashion call learning pedantry but now he says he has no less i assure you than a veneration for you  your etc  mr pope to mr c december       0 it seems that my late mention of crashaw and my quotation from him has moved your curiosity i therefore send you the whole author who has held a place among my other books of this nature for some years in which time having read him twice or thrice i find him one of those whose works may just deserve reading i take this poet to have writ like a gentleman that is at leisure hours and more to keep out of idleness than to establish a reputation so that nothing regular or just can be expected from him all that regards design form fable which is the soul of poetry all that concerns exactness or consent of parts which is the body will probably be wanting only pretty conceptions fine metaphors glittering expressions and something of a neat cast of verse which are properly the dress gems or loose ornaments of poetry may be found in these verses this is indeed the case of most other poetical writers of miscellanies nor can it well be otherwise since no man can be a true poet who writes for diversion only these authors should be considered as versifiers and witty men rather than as poets and under this head will only fall the thoughts the expression and the numbers these are only the pleasing parts of poetry which may be judged of at a view and comprehended all at once and to express myself like a painter their coloring entertains the sight but the lines and life of the picture are not to be inspected too narrowly  this author formed himself upon petrarch or rather upon marino his thoughts one may observe in the main are pretty but oftentimes far fetched and too often strained and stiffned to make them appear the greater for men are never so apt to think a thing great as when it is odd or wonderful and inconsiderate authors would rather be admired than understood this ambition of surprising a reader is the true natural cause of all fustian or bombast in poetry to confirm what i have said you need but look into his first poem of the weeper where the  d  th  th   th   st stanzas are as sublimely dull as the  th  th  th   th   th  0th and   d stanzas of the same copy are soft and pleasing and if these last want any thing it is an easier and more unaffected expression the remaining thoughts in that poem might have been spared being eihter but repetitions or very trivial and mean and by this example in the first one may guess at all the rest to be like this a mixture of tender gentle thoughts and sutiable expressions of sorcd and inextricable conceits and of needless fillersup to the rest from all which it is plain this author writ fast and set down what came uppermost a reader may skim off the froth and use the clear underneath but if he goes too deep will meet with a mouthful of dregs either the top or bottom of him are good for little but what he did in his own natural middleway is best  to speak of his numbers is a little difficult they are so various and irregular and mostly pindarick it is evident his heroic verse the best example of which is his musicks duel is carelessly made up but one may imagine from what it now is that had he taken more care it had been musical and pleasing enough not extremely majestic but sweet and the time considered of his writing he was even as uncorrect as he is none of the worst versificators  i will just observe that the best pieces of this author are a paraphrase on psalm    on lessius epitaph on mr ashton wishes to his supposed mistress and the dies irae  i am etc  mr pope to mr c december  0    0 i resume my old liberty of throwing out myself upon paper to you and making what thoughts float uppermost in my head the subject of a letter they are at present upon laughter which for ought i know may be the cause you might sometimes think me too remiss a friend when i was most entirely so for i am never so inclined to mirth as when i am most pleased and most easy which is in the company of a friend like yourself  as the fooling and toying with a mistress is a proof of fondness not disrespect so is raillery with a friend i know there are prudes in friendship who expect distance awe and adoration but i know you are not of them and i for my part am no idolworshipper though a papist if i were to address jupiter himself in a heathen way i fancy i should be apt to take hold of his knee in a familiar manner if not of his beard like dionysius i was just going to say of his buttons but i think jupiter wore none however i will not be positive to so nice a critic as you but his robe might be subnected with a fibula i know some philosophers define laughter a recommending ourselves to our own favor by comparison with the weakness of another but i am sure i very rarely laugh with that view nor do i believe children have any such consideration in their heads when they express their pleasure this way i laugh full as innocently as they for the most part and as sillily there is a difference too betwixt laughing about a thing and laughing at a thing one may find the inferior man to make a kind of casuistical distinction provoked to folly at the sight or observation of some circumstance of a thing when the thing itself appears solemn and august to the superior man that is our judgment and reason let an ambassador speak the best sense in the world and deport himself in the most graceful manner before a prince yet if the tail of his shirt happen as i have known it happen to a very wise man to hang out behind more people shall laugh at that than attend to the other till they recollect themselves and then they will not have a jot the less respect for the minister i must confess the iniquity of my countenance before you several muscles of my face sometimes take an impertinent liberty with my judgment but then my judgment soon rises and sets all right again about my mouth and i find i value no man so much as he in whose sight i have been playing the fool i cannot be subpersona before a man i love and not to laugh with honesty when nature prompts or folly which is more a second nature than any thing i know is but a knavish hypocritical way of making a mask of ones own face  to conclude those that are my friends i laugh with and those that are not i laugh at so am merry in company and if ever i am wise it is all by myself you take just another course and to those that are not your friends are very civil and to those that are very endearing and complaisant thus when you and i meet there will be the risus and blanditiae united together in conversation as they commonly are in a verse but without laughter on the one side or compliment on the other i assure you i am with real esteem  yours etc  mr c to mr pope october         mr wycherley visited me at the bath in my sickness and expressed much affection to me hearing from me how welcome his letters would be he presently writ to you in which i inserted my scrall and after a second he went to gloucester in his way to salop but was disappointed of a boat and so returned to the bath then he showed me your answer to his letters in which you speak of my good nature but i fear you found me very froward at reading yet you allow for my illness i could not possibly be in the same house with mr wycherley though i sought it earnestly nor come up to town with him he being engaged with others but whenever we met we talked of you he praises your essay on criticism poem and even outvies me in kind expressions of you as if he had not wrote two letters to you he was for writing every post i put him in mind he had already forgive me this wrong i know not whither my talking so much of your great humanity and tenderness to me and love to him or whether the return of his natural disposition to you was the cause but certainly you are now highly in his favor now he will come this winter to your house and i must go with him but first he will invite you speedily to town  i arrived on saturday last much wearied yet had wrote sooner but was told by mr gay who has writ a pretty poem to lintot and who gives you his service that you was gone from home lewis showed me your letter which set me right and your next letter is impatiently expected by me mr wycherley came to town on sunday last and kindly surpised me with a visit on monday morning we dined and drank together and i saying to our loves he replied it is mr pope s health he said he would go to mr thorolds and leave a letter for you though i cannot answer for the event of all this in respect to him yet i can assure you that when you please to come you will be most desirable to me as always by inclination so now by duty who shall ever be  your etc  mr pope to mr c nov         i received the entertainment of your letter the day after i had sent you one of mine and i am but this morning returned hither the news you tell me of the many difficulties you found in your return from bath gives me such a kind of pleasure as we usually take in accompanying our friends in their mixed adventures for methinks i see you laboring through all your inconveniences of the rough roads the hard saddle the trotting horse and what not what an agreeable surprise would it have been to me to have met you by pure accident which i was within an ace of doing and to have carried you off triumphantly set you on an easier pad and relieved the wandering knight with a nights lodging and rural repast at our castle in the forest but these are only the pleasing imaginations of a disappointed lover who must suffer in a melancholy absence yet these two months in the mean time i take up with the muses for want of your better company the muses quae nobiscum pernoctant peregrinantur rusticantur those aerial ladies just discover enough to me of their beauties to urge my pursuit and draw me on in a wandering maze of thought still in hopes and only in hopes of attaining those favors from em which they confer on their more happy admirers we grasp some more beautiful idea in our own brain than our endeavors to express it can set to the view of others and still do but labor to fall short of our first imagination the gay coloring which fancy gave at the first transient glance we had of it goes off in the execution like those various figures in the gilded clouds which while we gaze long upon to separate the parts of each imaginary image the whole faints before the eye and decays into confusion  i am highly pleased with the knowledge you give me of mr wycherleys present temper which seems so favorable to me i shall ever have such a fund of affection for him as to be agreeable to myself when i am so to him and cannot but be gay when he is in good humor as the surface of the earth if you will pardon a poetical similitude is clearer or gloomier just as the sun is brighter or more overcast  i should be glad to see the verses to lintot which you mention for methinks something oddly agreeable may be produced from that subject  for what remains i am so well that nothing but the assurance of your being so can make me better and if you would have me live with any satisfaction these dark days in which i cannot see you it must be by your writing sometimes to  your etc  mr c to mr pope dec        mr wycherley has i believe sent you two or three letters of invitation but you like the fair will be long solicited before you yield to make the favor the more acceptable to the lover he is much yours by his talk for that unbounded genius which has ranged at large like a libertine now seems confined to you and i should take him for your mistress too by your simile of the sun and earth it is very fine but inverted by the application for the gaiety of your fancy and the drooping of his by the withdrawing of your luster persuades me it would be juster by the reverse oh happy favorite of the muses how pernoctare all night long with them but alas you do but toy but skirmish with them and decline a close engagement leave elegy and translation to the inferior class on whom the muses only glance now and then like our wintersun and then leave em in the dark think on the dignity of tragedy which is of the greater poetry as dennis says and foil him at his other weapon as you have done in criticism every one wonders that a genius like yours will not support the sinking drama and mr wilks though i think his talent is comedy has expressed a furious ambition to swell in your buskins we have had a poor comedy of johnsons not ben which held seven nights and has got him three hundred pounds for the town is sharpset on new plays in vain would i fire you by interest or ambition when your mind is not susceptible of either though your authority arising from the general esteem like that of pompey must infallibly assure you of success for which in all your wishes you will be attended with those of  yours etc  mr pope to mr c december         if i have not writ to you so soon as i ought let my writing now atone for the delay as it will infallibly do when you know what a sacrifice i make you at this time and that every moment my eyes are employed upon this paper they are taken off from two of the finest faces in the universe but indeed it is some consolation to me to reflect that while i but write this period i escape some hundred fatal darts from those unerring eyes and about a thousand deaths or better now you that delight in dying would not once have dreamt of an absent friend in these circumstances you that are so nice an admirer of beauty or as a critic would say after terence so elegant a spectator of forms you must have a sober dish of coffee and a solitary candle at your side to write an epistle lucubratory to your friend whereas i can do it as well with two pair of radiant lights that outshine the golden god of day and silver goddess of night with all the refulgent eyes of the firmament  you fancy now that saphos eyes are two of these my tapers but it is no such matter sir these are eyes that have more persuasion in one glance than all saphos oratory and gesture together let her put her body into what moving postures she pleases indeed indeed my friend you could never have found so improper a time to tempt me with interest or ambition let me but have the reputation of these in my keeping and as for my own let the devil or let dennis take it for ever how gladly would i give all i am worth that is to say my pastorals for one of them and my essay for the other i would lay out all my poetry in love an original for a lady and a translation for a waiting maid alas what have i to do with jane gray as long as miss molly miss betty or miss patty are in this world shall i write of beauties murdered long ago when there are those at this instant that murder me i will even compose my own tragedy and the poet shall appear in his own person to move compassion twill be far more effectual than bayss entering with a rope about his neck and the world will own there never was a more miserable object brought upon the stage  now you that are a critic pray inform me in what manner i may connect the foregoing part of this letter with that which is to follow according to the rules i would willingly return mr gay my thanks for the favor of his poem and in particular for his kind mention of me i hoped when i heard a new comedy had met with success upon the stage that it had been his to which i really wish no less and had it been any way in my power should have been very glad to have contributed to it is introduction into the world his a receipt to make a miscellany verses to lintot have put a whim into my head which you are like to be troubled with in the opposite page this copy of verses will be found in our second volume  take it as you find it the production of half an hour the other morning i design very soon to put a task of a more serious nature upon you in reviewing a piece of mine that may better deserve criticism and by that time you have done with it i hope to tell you in person with how much fidelity i am  your etc a pope
