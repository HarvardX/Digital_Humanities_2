contest mrs jordan mrs hamford mrs hopkins hannah miss heard several servants  scene london time one day  the wedding day a comedy act i scene i an apartment at lord rakelands enter a servant followed by lord rakeland lord rakeland at home to be sure i am  how could you make any doubts about it  exit servant deny me to my old acquaintance and favorite friend tom contest  enter mr contest my dear contest i congratulate us both that your travels are completed and that you are come to taste for the remainder of your life the joys of your own country   mr contest whether to taste joy or sorrow i am yet in doubt for i am uncertain in what manner i shall be received by my father   lord rakeland have not you seen him yet   mr contest no  nor dare i till i know in what humor he is   lord rakeland in a good one you may depend upon it for he is very lately married   mr contest to my utter concern i heard some time ago indeed that it was his design to marry again but as he has never condescended to make me acquainted with it himself i know nothing farther respecting the marriage than what public report has thrown in my way pray can you tell me who my new mother is   lord rakeland i am told she is very young extremely lively and prodigiously beautiful i am told too that she has been confined in the country dressed and treated like a child till her present age of eighteen in order to preserve the appearance of youth in her mother   mr contest but who is her mother of what family is she   lord rakeland that i dont know  and i suppose your father did not consider of what family she was but merely what family she was likely to bring him   mr contest yes i have no doubt but he married on purpose to disinherit me for having written to him that i had fixed my affections upon a widow of small fortune but one who was so perfectly to my wishes that even his commands could not force me to forsake her   lord rakeland and were you in earnest   mr contest i thought i was then but at present i am more humble i have implored his pardon for those hasty expressions and now only presume by supplication to obtain his approbation of my choice   lord rakeland is she a foreigner   mr contest no an english woman  we met at florence  parted at venice  and she arrived in london just four days before me   lord rakeland and when will you introduce me to her   mr contest are you as much a man of gallantry as ever if you are you shall first promise me not to make love to her   lord rakeland as to that my dear friend you know i never make a promise when i think there is the least probability of my breaking it   mr contest then positively you shall not see my choice till i am secure of her but i can tell you what i will do  i will introduce you to my young motherinlaw if you like   lord rakeland my dear friend that will do quite as well  nay i dont know if it will not do better come let us go directly   mr contest hold not till i have obtained my fathers leave  for after offending him so highly as not to hear from him these six months i thought it necessary to send a letter to him as soon as i arrived this morning to beg his permission to wait upon him and here i suppose is his answer   enter a servant and gives a letter to mr contest servant your servant enquired for you sir and left this exit    mr contest breaks open the letter hastily and reads mr contest an invitation to go to his house immediately he reads the remainder of the letter and then expressing surprise  why my father tells me he was only married this very morning i heard he was married a week ago   lord rakeland and so did i  and so did half the town his marriage has even been in the newspapers these three days   mr contest ay these things are always announced before they take place and i most sincerely wish it had been delayed still longer   lord rakeland i do not  for i long to have a kiss of the bride   mr contest pshaw my lord as it is the wedding day i cannot think of taking you now it may be improper   lord rakeland not at all not at all a wedding day is a public day and sir adam knows upon what familiar terms you and i are indeed my dear friend my going will be considered but as neighbourly i can take no denial  i must go   mr contest well if it must be so come then going stops notwithstanding the cause i have for rejoicing at this kind invitation from my father still i feel embarrassed at the thoughts of appearing before him in the presence of his young wife for i have no doubt but she will take a dislike to me   lord rakeland and if she should i have no doubt but she will take a liking to me so come away and be in spirits exeunt   scene ii an apartment at sir adam contests enter sir adam dressed in white clothes like a bridegroom sir adam nothing is so provoking as to be in a situation where one is expected to be merry  it is like being asked in company to tell a good story and to be entertaining and then you are sure to be duller than ever you were in your life now notwithstanding this is my wedding day i am in such a blessed humor that i should like to make every persons life in this house a burden to them but i will not struggling with himself  no i will not  what a continual combat is mine to feel a perpetual tendency to every vice and to possess no one laudable quality but that of a determination to overcome all my temptations i am strongly impelled to violent anger and yet i have the resolution to be a calm peaceable man  i am inclined to suspicion yet i conquer it and will place confidence in others  i am disposed to malice yet i constantly get the better of it  i am addicted to love yet i  no hold  there i must stop  that is a failing which always did get the better of me behold an instance of it   enter lady contest slowly and pensively dressed like a bride sir adam aside now i will be in a good humor in spite of all my doubts and fears   lady contest did you send for me sir adam   sir adam yes my dear your guardian is just stepped home to bring his wife to dine with us and i wished to have a few minutes conversation with you sit down they sit i observed lady contest and it gave me uneasiness that at church this morning while the ceremony was performing you looked very pale you have not yet wholly regained your color and instead of your usual cheerful countenance and air i perceive a pensive dejected  come look cheerful very sharply  why dont you look cheerful checking himself and softening his voice  consider every one should be happy upon their wedding day for it is a day that seldom comes above once in a persons life   lady contest but with you sir adam it has come twice   sir adam very true  it has  and my first was a day indeed i shall never forget it my wife was as young as you are now    lady contest and you were younger than you are now   sir adam starts  then aside  no i will not be angry to her  she was beautiful too  nay more she was good she possessed every quality  but this is not a proper topic on the present occasion and so my dear let us change the subject   lady contest pray sir adam is it true that your son is come to town   sir adam it is and i expect him here every moment   lady contest and have you invited no other company all day   sir adam your guardian and his wife mr and mrs ploughman you know will be here and what other company would you have   lady contest in the country we had always fiddles and dancing at every wedding and i declare i have been merrier at other peoples weddings than i think i am likely to be at my own   sir adam if you loved me lady contest you would be merry in my company alone do you love me my first wife loved me dearly   lady contest and so do i love you dearly  just the same as i would love my father if he were alive   sir adam aside now could i lay her at my feet for that sentence but i will not  i will not struggling with himself answer me this  would you change husbands with any one of your acquaintance   lady contest what signifies now my answering such a question as that when i am sure not one of my acquaintance would change with me   sir adam what makes you think so violently  softening  your equipage will be by far the most splendid of any ladys you will visit i have made good my promise in respect to your jewels too and i hope you like them   lady contest like them to be sure  oh my dear sir adam they even make me like you   sir adam a very poor proof of your love if you can give me no other   lady contest but i will give you fifty others   sir adam anxiously name them   lady contest first  i will always be obedient to you   sir adam that is well   lady contest second  i will never be angry with you if you should go out and stay for a month  nay for a year  or for as long as ever you like   sir adam aside and struggling with his passion sure i was not born to commit murder i had better go out of the room   lady contest humming a tune and old robin gray was kind to me   sir adam rising in agitation oh my first wife my first wife what a treasure was she but my treasure is gone  sighing lady contest not all your money i hope sir adam for my guardian told me you had a great deal   sir adam and did you marry me for that what makes you blush come confess to me  for there was always a sincerity in your nature which charmed me beyond your beauty it was that sincerity and that alone which captivated me   lady contest then i am surprised you did not marry your chaplains widow good old mrs brown   sir adam why so   lady contest because i have heard you say there was not so sincere a woman on the face of the earth   sir adam aside and egad i almost wish i had married her by what i have now said lady contest i meant to let you know that in comparison with virtues i have no esteem for a youthful or a beautiful face   lady contest oh dear how you and i differ for i here declare i do love a beautiful youthful face better than i love any thing in the whole world   sir adam in a halfsmothered rage leave the room  leave the room instantly after a violent struggle no come back  come back my dear  tenderly  aside i will be in a good humor presently  but not just yet  yes  i will get the better of it  i will not use her ill  i have sworn at the altar not to use her ill and i will keep my vow he sits down affecting perfect composure and after a pause  pray lady contest pray have not you heard from your mother yet   lady contest not a line nor a word   sir adam it is wonderful that she should not send us a proper address there is no doubt but that every letter we have sent to her since she has been abroad has miscarried however it will be great joy and pride to her when she hears of your marriage   lady contest yes  for she always said i was not born to make my fortune   sir adam which prediction i have annulled and after all  come hither  come hither  takes her kindly by the hand  and after all i do not repent that i have  for although i cannot say that you possess all those qualifications which my first wife did yet you behave very well considering your age   lady contest and i am sure so do you considering yours   sir adam all my resolution is gone and i can keep my temper no longer aside go into your own chamber immediately he takes her by the hand and puts her off i will  i will  i will  threatening as if going to follow her then stops short no i will go another way  as he is going off at the opposite side enter a servant   servant my young master and another gentleman   enter mr contest and lord rakeland mr contest to sir adam i kneel sir for your pardon and your blessing   sir adam you have behaved very ill but as you appear sensible of it i forgive and am glad to see you but i expect that your future conduct shall give proof of your repentance my lord rakeland i beg pardon for introducing this subject before you but you are not wholly unacquainted with it i suppose   lord rakeland mr

the scene desire lady contest to walk this way   lord rakeland i sincerely congratulate you too sir adam   sir adam thank you my lord thank you  enter lady contest sir adam takes her by the hand and presents mr contest to her my dear this is my son  and this tom is your motherinlaw   lady contest dear sir adam half laughing i was never so surprised in my life always when you spoke of your son you called him tom and tommy and i expected to see a little boy   sir adam and have you any objection to his being a man   lady contest oh no i think i like him the better to mr contest  sir i am very glad to see you   mr contest i give your ladyship joy salutes her hand   lady contest i shall be very fond of him sir adam  i shall like him as well as if he was my own   sir adam aside now am i in a rage lest seeing my son a man she should be more powerfully reminded that i am old and i long to turn him out of doors but i will not  no  i will be the kinder to him for this very suspicion come tom let me shake hands with you  we have not shaken hands a great while and let this be a sign of the full renewal of my paternal affection   lord rakeland sir adam you have not introduced me to lady

sir adam but he is not my son   lady contest i cannot help thinking he is looking steadfastly at him   sir adam i tell you he is not   lady contest nay nay you are joking  i am sure he is   sir adam raising his voice i tell you no   lady contest why he is very like you she goes up to lord rakeland and looks in his face no he is not so like when you are close i beg ten thousand pardons sir you are not at all like sir adam   sir adam aside zounds now i am jealous  and i am afraid my propensity will get the better of me but no it shall not  no it shall not  my lord i beg your pardon but i want half an hours private conversation with my son will you excuse us   lord rakeland certainly sir adam  i beg you will make no stranger of me   sir adam taking mr contest by the hand come tom aside  there now i have left them alone and i think this is triumphing over my jealousy pretty well well done sir adam well done well done exit with mr contest sir adam smiling with selfapplause at the victory he has gained   lord rakeland my dear lady contest though i acknowledge i have not the happiness to be your son yet permit me to beg a blessing on my knees  it is this  tell me when and where i shall have the happiness of seeing you again   lady contest dear sir without any compliment the happiness will be done to me   lord rakeland enchanting woman appoint the time   lady contest i will ask sir adam   lord rakeland no  without his being present   lady contest i dont know if i shant like that full as well   lord rakeland appoint a time then just to play a game at cribbage   lady contest or what do you think of beggar my neighbor  would not that do as well   lord rakeland perfectly as well the very thing   lady contest but you must take care how you play for it is a game you may lose a great deal of money by   lord rakeland but sir adam must not know of it   enter sir adam and speaks aside sir adam resolutions come and go  i wish i could have kept mine and staid away a little longer affecting good humor what my lord here still holding conversation with this giddy woman   lord rakeland affecting coldness i assure you sir adam i am very well pleased with lady contests conversation   lady contest and i am sure my lord i am very much pleased with yours   lord rakeland we have been talking about a game at cards   lady contest but you said sir adam was not to be of the party   lord rakeland yes sir adam  but not mr contest   lady contest no indeed you said sir adam   lord rakeland oh no   lady contest eagerly yes  because dont you remember i said  and you made answer    lord rakeland i dont remember any thing    lady contest what dont you remember kneeling for my blessing   sir adam how what   lord rakeland sir adam it would be a breach of good manners were i to contradict lady contest a second time therefore i acknowledge that she is right  and that i have been in the wrong   exit bowing with great respect lady contest to sir adam apart and pulling his sleeve will not you ask him to dinner   sir adam ask him to dinner what a difference between you and my first wife  would she have wished me to ask him to dinner would she have suffered a man to kneel    lady contest i did not suffer him to kneel a moment   sir adam  but my first wife was a model of perfection and it is unjust to reproach you with the comparison yet i cannot help saying  would she had lived   lady contest and i am sure i wish so with all my heart   sir adam fetching a heavy sigh but she was suddenly snatched from me   lady contest how was it sir adam were you not at sea together and so a storm arose  and so you took to the longboat  and she would stay in the ship  and so she called to you and you would not go  and you called to her and she would not come and so your boat sailed and her ship sunk   sir adam dont dont  i cannot bear to hear it repeated i loved her too sincerely but the only proof i can now give of my affection is to be kind to her son and as by what he acknowledged to me his heart i perceived was bent upon marriage i have given him leave to introduce to me the lady on whom he has fixed his choice  and if i like her    lady contest has he fixed his choice who is the young lady what is her name   sir adam i did not ask her name   lady contest but i hope you will give your consent whoever she is   sir adam and if i do in a little time they may both wish i had not young people are so capricious they dont know their own minds half an hour for instance i dare say you think very highly of that young lord who was here just now but if you were to see him two or three times a week you would cease to admire him   lady contest i should like to try do invite him here two or three times a week on purpose to try   enter servant servant mr and mrs ploughman are come sir and dinner is almost ready exit   lady contest looking at her hand gives a violent scream oh oh  oh dear sir adam  oh dear oh dear oh dear   sir adam what is the

nonsense what ill luck can happen to us while we are good   lady contest but suppose we should not be good   sir adam we always may if we please   lady contest i know we may but then sometimes it is a great deal of trouble   sir adam come dont frighten yourself about omens you will find your ring again   lady contest do you think that young lord may not have found it suppose we send to ask him   sir adam did you miss it while he was here   lady contest no nor should not have missed any thing if he had staid till midnight   sir adam taking her by the hand come come to dinner going stops but i

an apartment at mr milldens enter lady autumn and mrs hamford mrs hamford my dear lady autumn mr contest is not of a proper age for a lover much less for a husband of yours   lady autumn mrs hamford i believe old as you pretend to think me now you thought me young but a few weeks ago at venice when on your first landing there you imposed upon me your romantic tale and prevailed with me to bring you to england   mrs hamford hold madam do not conclude too hastily that because i have for a few days since my arrival in my native country deferred my promise of revealing to you my real name and my connections here that i am for this reason an impostor   lady autumn no upon recollection you certainly have been living on a savage island for these ten or twelve years which gives you all these hottentot ideas in respect to the advanced age of women in some savage countries women are old at seventeen but in this enlightened nation we are all young at seventy   enter mr millden mr millden lady autumn i make no apology for entering your apartment thus abruptly because i come with good news  your daughter is married   lady autumn married what while i have been abroad   mr millden no doubt  but i cannot give you any particulars of the marriage nor tell you even the gentlemans name  for i only passed her guardian by accident in his carriage and i had not an opportunity to enquire nor he to inform me farther than that it was a most advantageous union for your daughter for that her husband is a man of fortune and title   mrs hamford there lady autumn you find you have a daughter old enough to be a wife   lady autumn more shame for her  why was not my consent asked   mr millden you were out of england and no letters reached you however your daughters guardian will call upon you in the evening and explain to you every particular   lady autumn but now my dear mr millden and you my dear mrs hamford dont let this marriage escape your lips if mr contest should call this evening  for if my daughters husband should not after all be a man of some importance i should wish to keep it a secret from mr contest that i have a daughter married exit   mr millden mrs hamford i observe a gloom upon your countenance i hope no enquiries you have made concerning any part of your family since you arrived in england  he takes her hand  you tremble what is the matter   mrs hamford i tremble till a visit which i am now going to make is over and then whatever is my destiny i trust in that power which has supported me through numerous trials to give me resignation   exeunt scene ii an apartment at sir adam contests enter lady contest followed by her maid lady contest pulling off her cloak has any body called on me hannah since i have been out   hannah yes madam an elderly gentlewoman but she refused to leave her name  she said she had particular business and wanted to speak to you in private   lady contest then pray let me see her when she comes again   hannah i told her madam that you were only gone to the milliners in the next street   lady contest has any body else called hannah   hannah no maam   enter a servant servant lord rakeland if your ladyship is not engaged    lady contest drawing hannah on one side oh hannah hannah is this the elderly gentlewoman  oh for shame hannah  however poor hannah dont be uneasy i will not be very angry with you to the

i am almost every bit as well pleased   enter lord rakeland exit hannah lord rakeland my adorable lady contest    lady contest i hope you are very well  but i need not ask for you look charmingly   lord rakeland and you look like a divinity i met sir adam this moment in his carriage going out and that emboldened me    lady contest yes sir he is gone out for a little while with my guardian but he will soon be back i suppose sir you called to play an hand of cards   lord rakeland no  my errand was to tell you  i love you i adore you and to plead for your love in return   lady contest but that is not in my power to give   lord rakeland you cannot possibly have given it to sir adam   lady contest i shant tell you what i have done with it   lord rakeland you could love me i know you could   lady contest if you were my husband i would try and then perhaps take all the pains i would i could not   lord rakeland oh that i were your husband kneeling   lady contest you would not kneel so if you were not even on the wedding day   lord rakeland no but i would clasp you thus   throwing his arms about her lady contest oh dear oh dear i am afraid sir adams first wife would not have suffered this   lord rakeland why talk of sir adam oh that you were mine instead of his   lady contest and would you really marry me if i were single   lord rakeland would i  yes  this instant were you unmarried this instant with rapture i would become your happy bridegroom   lady contest i wonder what sir adam would say were he to hear you talk thus he suspected you were in love with me at the very first  i cannot say i did  i suspected nothing  but i have found a great deal   lord rakeland nothing to my disadvantage i hope   lady contest no  nor any thing that shall be of disadvantage to sir adam   lord rakeland why are you perpetually talking of your husband   lady contest because when i am in your company i am always thinking of him   lord rakeland do i make you think of your husband   lady contest yes  and you make me tremble for him   lord rakeland never be unhappy about sir adam   lady contest i will not  and he shall never have cause to be unhappy about me  for i will go lock myself up till he comes home going   lord rakeland holding her what are you alarmed at is there any thing to terrify you either in my countenance or address  in your presence i feel myself an object of pity not of terror   lady contest ay but this may be all makebelieve like the poor little boy in the song  song i in the dead of the night when with labor oppressed all mortals enjoy the calm
