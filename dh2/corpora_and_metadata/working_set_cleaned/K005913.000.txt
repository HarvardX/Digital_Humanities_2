observations on the gout and rheumatism  exhibiting instances of persons who were greatly relieved in the fit of the gout and of others who were cured of the gout in the head stomach and bowels of obstinate rheumatisms and of the swellings stiffness and contractions of the limbs after irregular or longcontinued fits of the gout by medicines discovered in america  with a short account of some medicines and ways of curing diseases used by the native indians  to which are added a few remarkable cases of other diseases  humbly inscribed to the college of physicians by henry flower an american  new things do i declare before they spring forth i tell you of them isaiah london printed for e cook at the royal exchange  mdcclxvi  to the president and members of the college of physicians of london these observations of the gout and rheumatism are humbly inscribed by their most obedient servant henry flower  to the president and members of the college of physicians london gentlemen though i have not the honor of being known to any one of you i think i cannot address the following pages but to you  every person who is sick and takes medicines is sensible of the relief he meets with from them and therefore is the best judge of their merit and efficacy but god be praised for his goodness to us poor mortals the discoveries and improvements i have made in treating the gout and rheumatism are so successful that while they meet with the blessings of the afflicted they can abide the severest examination of you gentlemen of the faculty which emboldens me to lay this account before you  i present you with only a few cases out of a great number these will serve to show you what has been done and as several patients have applied to me since i have been in this city whom i have not yet had leisure on account of other business to attend i may hereafter lay before you some observations made on the spot when i have completed those affairs that to me are more material and for your further satisfaction and for the satisfaction of the public you may then examine my patients before i begin with them visit them under the operation of the medicines and see the event  some of the following cases are well known to several gentlemen in london one of the patients captain samuel bayard is now in town and may be examined on the subject and i could moreover refer to a physician of eminence at present in this city who can if he pleases give a full and satisfactory account of these matters as he attended several of my patients while under cure and i openly and honestly communicated to him for his candid behavior to me the medicines i use in the gout rheumatism and other obstinate diseases and i find he has made some considerable cures with them in these countries  it will be no disadvantage i hope in your eyes that the person whom providence made the instrument of these discoveries was not regularly brought up to the business of physic for the race is not to the swist nor the battle to the strong my own ill health first made me read physic i afterward searched into chemistry and the virtues of plants and made numberless wearisome experiments in those ways and on human bodies in sickness and in health by which means i fell upon some of the medicines i now use with such uncommon success in various stubborn and till now incurable maladies  in the year      i was called to a gentleman who was threatened with a mortification while he was in a violent fit of the gout he had been frequently attacked with the gout and at this time was greatly afflicted with it in the wrist fingers feet ancles and knees i gave him some medicines to prevent the impending mortification and to my great surprise that was not only effected but in a few days all the gouty complaints went off which he informed me used to continue between two and three months this unexpected success encouraged me to pursue the lucky hint and i have ever since that time made many experiments in relation to the gout and the means to relieve or cure it till i brought the practice to the present degree of certainty and success  that you may kindly receive this account of a new discovery and that it may hereafter by your superior abilities be made more useful to the afflicted is the hearty wish of  your humble servant h flower  observations on the gout and rheumatism the gout has been so long esteemed an incurable disorder that mankind have at last brought themselves to think an attempt to cure it to be imprudent as well as impracticable as if it was more advantageous to enjoy health for nine months in the year at the severe penance of a painful illness the other three than by eradicating the cause of those evils to pass the whole year in full vigor and strength this absurd notion puts me in mind of what i have read somewhere of the inhabitants of the alps who being in general subject to monstrous swellings about the throat look upon those horrid deformities as so many real beauties it is a comfort indeed that we can thus draw pleasure out of pain and persuade ourselves that what we cannot obtain would be improper for us to possess  for my part i do not pretend to cure the gout so that it will never return but i am by no means convinced that it is impossible to do it i do not pretend to do it because the experience i have had is not long enough to warrant me to say so or to think so and yet the experience i have had gives me great reason to imagine it not impossible it is upon experience alone that i ground my judgment and my reasoning upon these matters i shall say nothing of the nature of the gouty matter and how it is formed in the body or how the fits of the gout are brought on for all that is mere theory and supposition i shall only argue from what i have seen and from what i have done we may say of the gout what we do of fevers pleurisies agues dropsies jaundice etc that though they be once cured they may return again but for my part experience and plain reasoning from it authorize me to carry the matter much further and i can readily conceive that the constitution and habit of body of gouty persons which dispose them to the disorder may by the use of medicines be so amended altered and as it were changed like unto that of a healthy person who never had the gout that it will never afterward or at least for a long time generate or collect any gouty matter now to judge whether this can be done let experience be our guide many things have been recommended as infallible for radically curing the gout but what happened on useing them some of them indeed prevented the returns of the disorder but then as far as i can find the patient never enjoyed sound and strong health from whence it is plain those things did not cure but suppressed the disorder now on the contrary if the patient had become active vigorous strong and robust we might pronounce the medicines were truly beneficial and the end proposed to be properly answered by them with regard to the medicines i use i must honestly confess that many of my patients have had returns of the gout since i first took them in hand but not oftener nor indeed so often as before so that all the merit of the medicines in those cases consisted in completely carrying off a fit in some intermediate time from two days to about twelve according to the violence of the disorder and constitution of the person that in all appearance would have tortured the patient for two or three months but whether the return of the disorder in these patients was owing to their irregularity in the use of the medicines or to the insufficiency of the medicines to work a thorough change in the constitution i cannot pretend to say i speak only what i know i have however had other patients who used to be afflicted with a fit once or twice in a year or in two years but who after going through a course of my medicines regularly and living prudently for sometime afterward have never had a return but grown hearty and strong as indeed every gouty person who took them have done it is now above twelve years since i administered the medicines to some of these patients and it is from thence that i am inclined to think a radical cure may be made though as i said before the short experience of so few years will not allow me to be entirely of that opinion much more to affirm it as a fact and therefore notwithstanding the probability of the thing i leave it to time and further experience to determine whether the gout can be radically cured or not  i thought it necessary to say thus much to prevent people being carried away with wrong notions of things or forming wrong notions of what i say but after all all i know by experience is that these medicines completely carry off the present regular fit with expedition and safety but that where the disorder is lest to itself nature seldom makes a perfect despumation of the gouty matter which i take to be the reason that one fit comes so quickly upon the back of another and that the joints are so greatly injured by the disorder whereas by these medicines the body is perfectly cleared of the gouty particles the next fit does not come on so soon and the limbs and joints are preserved i know too by experience that they bring the irregular gout to be regular or expel it the body without going through those regular stages as frequently happens where the gout affects the head stomach or bowels and i also know by experience that they cure the swellings stiffness and contractions of the limbs which are occasioned by catching cold in the fit or by the long continuance or frequent return of the disorder as for the sciatica and rheumatism they are in general so nearly allied to the gout that i need say nothing about them  it may be asked how the medicines work upon the body to perform such cures with so much ease to the patient to which i answer that i dont know nor dont care facts speak for themselves and put it beyond all doubt that such cures have been wrought and i am ready to show before any body that they may be done again but putting the evidence of facts out of the question i would beg to ask those gentlemen who are for judging of the practicability of things by the weak powers of human reason whether it is not accusing the goodness and wisdom of providence who has enriched this world with thousands of plants to nourish our bodies and relieve our infirmities to suppose that he has left us destitute of assistance in the gout or is it not more reasonable to think that amidst the vast variety of plants he has created for our use he may have endued some with virtues and powers to cure this the most painful and grievous disease mankind is liable to though their manner of operation should be concealed from us intermitting fevers and agues puzzled the faculty before the peruvian bark was known in europe the bite of the rattle snake is mortal in a few hours the best physicians and surgeons cannot check the poison but the indians have taught us to cure it with a common herb  those poor savages the american indians with no other assistance than experience and the natural light of reason have cured many diseases that baffled the most ingenious of the faculty in sinous ulcers they make a decoction of certain herbs and roots with which they bath and wash the ulcers pouring part of it into the cavities these applications soon soften and dissolve the hardness new flesh sprouts up and the ulcer heals i have attempted to imitate their practice in this respect and have succeeded in it in some cases of fistulas of the anus and particularly in one who had been cut in vain the use of the seneca snakeroot and some other medicines we learned from the indians need not be mentioned to prove their knowledge of useful herbs by the abuse of strong liquor they are much troubled with nervous diseases that in women occasion miscarriages and many other female complaints for all which they take a decoction of an aromaticroot that is of great service i have given it myself in nervous cases and have experienced better effects from it than from any vegetable or chemical medicine i ever tried this root is very difficult to be got growing only in particular places and it is of so delicate a nature that it does not retain its virtues so long as one could wish the indians are much exposed to cold and frequently have their hearing much hurt by it which they cure with the juice of a certain herb mixed with bears grease or fish oil and put into the ears some who have tried it told me that it excited the sensation of an explosive noise in the ear which opened the organ after which their hearing returned but the most curious thing in their practice that i have seen is the different kinds of baths i mean baths prepared from different herbs and ways of sweating for different diseases with these and the decoctions they give the patient to drink at the same time they do wonders in many diseases there is now in london a person of indisputable veracity who had the operation of sweating performed upon him by an indian for a violent toothache and pain in the face he had been long troubled with which was soon and so effectually removed that he has never had the least return of it since  cases mr thomas white merchant this gentleman was about forty years old when he became my patient about eight years before he was attacked for the first time with the gout he had several fits in the following years for two or three years past the fits were very violent and usually continued from six weeks to two months sometimes three months before he was able to walk abroad eight months before i saw him he was taken with an intermitting fever in that disorder he complained of a pain in the right side which grew more troublesome at times afterward the next fit of the gout came on with its usual violence and the pain in his right side returned with it in the nights his pains became so violent as not only to deprive him of sleep but almost of his senses the disorder had continued about three days before the medicines were given and in ten days after the first dose he walked to the coffee house nothing but a slight tenderness in the soles of his feet remaining which also soon went off and what is remarkable he never felt any thing of the pain in his side since he continued perfectly strong hearty and active for four years without refraining from those indulgencies which a hospitable social and friendly disposition led him into he then underwent such another fit as the above and from that time he has also enjoyed the same firm state of health as before  mr leashelear being attacked with pains in the feet resembling the first fits of the gout sent for a doctor who gave him the volatile tincture of guaicum and applied pultices to his feet which repelled the disorder into his breast neck and head with such violence that he was thought to be expiring the medicines i administered relieved him in two days but in crossing a wide ferry before he had recovered his strength he caught cold and had a relapse which however was carried off in two or three days by the same medicines and he has from that time continued perfectly well active and strong  james lowey aged about  0 years had been bedridden at times for several months with the hip gout he had tried many practitioners and taken various medicines but could get no relief his thigh and leg were diminished notwithstanding these discouraging circumstances i administered things to him and in process of time the thigh and leg recovered their size and strength and he came to walk as well as ever  capt samuel bayard aged  0 about    years ago was attacked with the gout and from that time till he applied to me commonly had a fit once a year or thereabouts during the fit he not only had violent pains in all his limbs but in his stomach and bowels the fits seldom went off in less than six weeks but in general they continued much longer as two or three months he always lived high and free from the very first fit his feet and hands never recovered their natural feeling but were dry hard and scaly with great heat in them and this as well in the intervals between the fits as in the fit itself his knees and ancles at last were enlarged his feet and toes always swelled and all those joints were so weak and stiff that he could scarce move them walking as he expressed it as if he had no joints or as if his legs and feet were made of wood his wrists hands and fingers were not quite so bad though in a similar condition his fingers particularly being so stiff that he could not by any means extend them out strait nor bend them without difficulty all this while he was much troubled with the gravel and passed several small stones when he applied to me in january    0 he was in the height of a fit the first night i did nothing the second i gave him some medicines the day following he was free of pain and in a few days more began to walk about the room by continuing the medicines a fortnight his feet and hands began to regain their natural feeling the hardness heat and dryness going off and in about six weeks or two months his limbs and joints became so pliant that he walked with as much ease as before he had the gout he went on however taking the medicines for several weeks longer since that time he has felt so little of the gravel that as he says it was not worth notice two years after this course for the gout he had a slight touch of the gravel and being costive took an opening medicine when he went to bed and drank some warm whey after it but contrary to my directions to take it upon an empty stomach he made a very hearty supper which with the medicine and the whey disagreeing with his stomach and bowels occasioned it to work sooner than was intended he fell into a sweat and the medicine beginning to operate downwards he very imprudently got up with the sweat upon him and went to a necessary in the yard the night was very cold and wet he was suddenly struck with a palsy of all the left side of his body for five of six days he had violent pains in that side but none in the other the whole side gradually withered and became emaciated he was confined to his bed for some weeks the withered parts at last began to recover their plumpness and strength and with my best endeavors it was about three months before he regained his strength and walked with his usual firmness from that time to the present he has enjoyed perfect health and the free use of his limbs he is now as well as any man of his years his hands have their natural feeling his feet perspire freely his joints are of their natural size he has had no pain in his stomach or bowels his appetite is good and he sleeps well he has had nothing of the gou since i first took him in hand till within these six months that he once or twice felt slight twichings in his feet but they went off directly with a copious perspiration on the parts  i samuel bayard now in london having read the above account declare it to be true in every particular and am ready if required to attest the same and that several other gouty persons whom i am well acquainted with have received great benefi from mr flower  mr gomez merchant near  0 years of age but much more in constitution ha been subject to the gout for  0 years for many of the last years he neither had a complete fit nor was ever entirely free of pain his legs feet and ancles were greatly enlarged and so weak that he could scarce wal or stand he was very desirous of trying these remedies and though it was represented to him that his disorder was too much riveted to admit of a cure or of much relief he insisted upon taking them he did so for about four weeks in that time his legs were somewhat reduced and the motion of his joints became easier and freer but these alterations were of short continuance for in two or three months his joints and legs relapsed nearly into their old state it is to be observed that the medicines brought his irregular pains to a regular though slight fit which was soon relieved after this he had much less pain and enjoyed much better health  mrs k aged    this lady for some years had been afflicted with a rheumatism in her limbs and back attended with hysterical complaints as they were called in three weeks she was freed of all her complaints and since that time has grown fat hearty and strong  william post though but    years of age has had several very severe fits of the gout and between them was much troubled with what were called rheumatic pains he was perfectly cured of a fit of the gout in eight or ten days and is now in a better state of health than he has been in from the first attack having felt nothing of the gout or rheumatism ever since  mrs rosevelt aged    had been troubled many years with violent rheumatic and hysteric complaints her hands and fingers were greatly deprived of their motion and the joints of the fingers were considerably enlarged and contracted several of the faculty had attempted to relieve her she had also tried a variety of things recommended by her acquaintances from some of which she received a little temporary relief after a course of these medicines her pains became easier and she acquired the use of her hands and fingers the swellings that were upon them being softened and diminished  captain hickey aged about    this gentleman for several years had been afflicted at least once a year with a violent fit of the gout latterly it seized his arms hands and knees as well as feet these fits not only confined him to his bed or room for two months or more but even after the fit was gone off he was liable to have short but painful returns of the disorder upon catching the least cold he was cured of the fit in less than half of the time it usually took to go off and has not felt any thing like the returns of it which formerly happened upon being exposed to the cold  captain pavey aged about  0 had been subject to the gout about    years while he was in a frontier garrison in      he was seized with a violent return of the disorder in his hands knees and feet and from the badness of the accommodations at that place suffered greatly the disorder instead of going off in about six or eight weeks as usual confined him almost entirely for four months to his bed and though his pains by that time became less violent and constant they still continued to afflict him his ancles feet and toes became thicker and grew so weak and stiff that he could not walk without great uneasiness and difficulty in this condition he was brought to town in      he took the medicines and lived very regularly for about four weeks and received so much benefit from them that being able to walk or go abroad with greater ease and facility he met with too many temptations not to be guilty of some intemperance but notwithstanding these irregularities and repeated neglects in taking his medicines in about two months from the time he began to take them he got almost rid of the frequent pains he had been troubled with since the last fit his ancles etc became less the joints grew stronger and more supple and he might now have walked with firmness and ease on any ground but for a pointed hardness or cornlike substance on the ball of the great toe that gave him pain whenever in walking the streets he happened to tread on a round stone in may following he went to sea and was    days on his passage to bristol during the voyage he was very well hearty and lived free a few weeks after his arrival in england he had a slight fit of the gout the pains were but trifling and in three days his feet having sweat plentifully the disorder went entirely off he continued after that perfectly well and felt no inconveniency or pain but what the induration occasioned when he happened to tread directly upon it he found himself indeed so well and hearty that he thought of procuring a commission again in the army which he had quitted on account of being rendered unfit for service by this disorder  i am far from thinking this gentleman is cured of the gout but i am persuaded that if he had behaved with more regularity the time he was taking the medicines he would have received relief sooner and continued a longer time free from a return of the disorder  captain valentine aged about  0 this gentleman had always indulged too much in social pleasures to escape the gout for several years he had been very much subject to it the attacks of it were sometimes regular and of a longer or shorter duration the last fit happened when he commanded a privateer and was on a cruise at sea his arms wrists fingers knees ancles feet and toes were cruelly afflicted he was confined on ship board to his bed about three or four months and was afterward grievously troubled with pains in all the above mentioned parts those joints were all swelled and so stiff and weak that he could not write and he fed himself and walked with great difficulty in this condition he had been several months when he sent to me he took the medicines with some interruption about four months and by that time regained in a great measure the use of his limbs and got quit of his pains the thickness of some of his joints went off in others it was much reduced he got a good appetite a good healthy complexion slept well and walked with ease and firmness this happened in      since that time he has had a fit or two which went off in two or three days without any assistance from medicine  mr william darlington wine merchant aged    years had been severely afflicted with the gout once or twice a year for    years for two or three years past his legs were frequently swelled and his ancles and upper part of the feet for the most part of that time were much enlarged and weaker than formerly one leg was much more swelled than the other and had several scorbutic ulcers upon it the former fits of the gout usually lasted eight or ten weeks he had labored under the present attack about four days when i was called to him and from the violence of the symptoms imagined it would continue the usual time he took the medicines regularly the pains were carried off in    hours the thickness and swellings of his leg ancles and feet which had lasted so long diminished gradually his appetite strength and spirits returned and he was able to walk about the house in  0 days his feet continued tender though free of pain for a few days longer but at the end of the fortnight he put on a pair of smaller shoes than he had wore for some years and went abroad about his business he has continued active strong and hearty without any illness whatever or the least return either of his gouty or scorbutic complaints though it is now above five years since he applied to me he is much accustomed to stamp his feet with all his force to show how strong and free of disorders they are  john dunscomb wine merchant    years of age almost every spring and fall for near  0 years had been tormented with the gout he seldom got the better of a fit in less than two months and they frequently continued longer in the winter    0 he was taken with a return of the disorder in his hands knees and feet attended with violent pains in his stomach bowels hips etc the fourth day from the beginning of the fit his breath was much oppressed his knees legs and feet vastly swelled and so much discolored that it was apprehended by a gentleman of the faculty who saw him in the afternoon that a mortification would come on before the next morning in the evening he became delirious at times in one of the intervals of sense he sent for me i did for him what i thought proper in a few hours afterward his pains became easier he passed a good night the next morning the swelling of the knees legs and feet was greatly abated and they had regained their natural color he felt no pain except a very little in an old scar on one knee was lively and full of spirits without thirst and had a good appetite in  0 days more he was perfectly well a tenderness only remaining in his feet for some days longer he has had lately a slight attack that was too inconsiderable to deserve notice going off in a day or two of itself and when i left him in new york last january he was hearty and strong  mrs zuracher aged    having taken cold in lyingin was seized with pains in all her joints that fixed at last in her left knee which swelled greatly and became excessive hard and painful it had been in this situation between two and three months when i was called and was daily growing worse in spite of the internal and external medicines she used but in a week after she was able to walk about and at the end of the fortnight was quite well  mr troop merchant this gentleman between  0 and  0 years of age had been confined to his chamber in the winter for above six weeks with a violent rheumatism affecting most of his limbs in the summer following he came to town and caught cold which brought on a return of his disorder the pain affected every limb and almost every joint his servants were obliged to put him to bed and take him up being unable to help himself notwithstanding the advantage of the season he apprehended from the violence of the disease that it would continue some weeks when i saw him he had been ill but two or three days i gave him some medicines in the evening the next morning his pains were gone the limbs were supple and easy he got up without assistance and in the afternoon went in a carriage a dozen miles to his country seat and i never heard that he had the least return of it though it is now above four years ago  i insert the following case because i think it singular and as i have mentioned the indian antispasmodic root i shall add an instance or two of its effects  john abel about  0 years of age this man had been subject to the epilepsy or falling sickness for many years the fits had latterly become more frequent than before instead of attacking him once in ten days or a fortnight they came on almost every day and sometimes he had two or three fits in a day the most remarkable thing in this case and for which i relate it was a sensation of intense coldness he complained of in his stomach he described it to be like a piece in his stomach of the size of a dollar or greater that was like so much ice he took many things to warm his stomach but the strongest spirits and the warmest medicines he could swallow gave him no relief he had taken bark valerian steel and other things without benefit within a week from the time i began with him he got rid of the coldness in his stomach and his fits stopped i went on giving him medicines and the fits did not return for three months and in all probability he would have been completely cured if he had not thought himself well and upon the strength of that laid aside all restraint and made too free with his constitution the disorder then returned and gradually became worse but before it had got to the former height he applied to a foreign practitioner and died as i was informed of an apoplexy  mrs b a gentlewoman about  0 years old had a numbness in one leg had been long troubled with dropsical swellings of the legs and afflicted with various nervous complaints to a terrible degree i gave her an infusion of the root i mentioned before it promoted the discharge by urine expelled vast quantities of wind procured a good appetite sweet refreshing sleep and restored her to perfect health as a person now in london can testify  mrs pelham about forty years old for a dozen years and more was afflicted with many nervous complaints and many disorders in consequence of them wind and swellings of the stomach and bowels indigestion costiveness lowness of spirits pains in the head giddiness universal languor and debility pains in the breast obstructions in the monthly evacuations little urine rising in the throat cough swelled legs etc in this long course of years she tried many doctors and many medicines that were recommended to her but nothing gave her any more than momentary relief except the indian root which in a few weeks removed all her complaints and restored her to perfect health and strength  i could relate many instances of persons who were rescued from destruction by these medicines when the gout after destroying the joints and going through the tragical scene described by sydenham had at last brought on most dangerous symptoms by invading the noble parts as the head stomach bowels lungs etc the foregoing histories however sufficiently prove their great efficacy in the most stubborn cases and therefore instead of swelling this little tract with superfluous instances of the like nature i shall throw together a few loose observations that may be of real use  the gout it is well known oftentimes puts on the appearance of other diseases many such cases i have cured in some instances i tried these medicines without any suspicion of the gout being the cause of the disorder or for any other reason than because the medicines were safe and every thing else had been tried in vain and i was agreeably surprised to see my patients get rid of their old complaints upon falling into a fit of the gout i have known this happen to several people who had been long afflicted with nervous and scorbutic diseases as they were supposed to be such as giddiness dimness of sight noise in the ears pains and stiffness in the head and in the eyes asthmas pains in the breast consumptions palsies pains in the loins mistaken for gravel or stone oppression and lowness of spirits fluxes obstructions in the liver certain female complaints etc all which arose from a gouty cause as the effects of the medicines and the recovery of the patients proved  in the treatment of gouty persons i do not confine myself to my own remedies i take all the assistance i can from the medicines in common use and for that reason i generally mix other medicines with my own to assist or determine their operation and effects as i think best according to the constitution of the person and the nature and seat of the disorder in different patients i also vary the method of proceeding as to bleeding vomiting sweating purging etc in different cases in the management and regular application of which particulars i received considerable assistance and information while i was in america from sir james jay to whom i communicated my discoveries and improvements in return for his candid behavior to me and since i have mentioned that gentlemans name i must take the liberty to add that he saw several of the patients whose cases are related in this tract and attended some of them at the request of the persons to assist me in the treatment of them  i do not assert it as a fact but i am inclined to think that these medicines after carrying off the gouty matter that occasions the present fit prevent the return of the disorder by rectifying those particular secretions and excretions which are naturally destined to discharge those morbid particles that when they are retained in the body and collected in sufficient quantity bring on the fit and what particularly makes me think so is that many people who are liable to the gout feel slight pains whenever the perspiration in the feet is obstructed that many people who have been troubled for years together with constant heat dryness and frequent sharp pains in the feet were perfectly cured when their feet were brought to perspire freely and naturally by the use of these medicines and further as far as i have been able to observe those persons are most severely afflicted with the gout who have the least perspiration in the feet  the affinity between the nature of the gout and stone is well known but i dont know that any one has taken notice that there is an affinity also in their cure it has indeed i think been thought that some things which were supposed to have given relief in the gout increased the calculous complaints the patients were troubled with if this be true it amounts to no more than what i have said before that those gout medicines did not cure but suppressed the disorder and instead of expelling the gouty matter only diverted the natural course of it but i have had the pleasure to observe that some patients of mine who were afflicted with both these cruel diseases have met with relief for the stone while i was treating them for the gout alone i shall say no more of the stone at present but defer the account of the experiments i made with various solvents and of their effects on the body till another opportunity  i selected the preceding cases for publilication because they are all of long standing and therefore the fittest to determine the merit of my discoveries and improvements most of them happened above five years none less than four years ago instances of a later date would be inconclusive we could not depend on the continuance of the good effects of the medicines nor could we be certain that bad consequences would not ensue but in these cases both those points are sufficiently determined these cases are some of the most favorable as well as unfavourable that occurred i could relate some others of a more striking nature which i suppress that i might not give uneasiness or seem to reflect on any person i hope the public will excuse the inaccuracies of style etc in this little performance for i have bestowed more time and pains in searching into the works of nature the powers of natural bodies the productions of chemistry and their effects on the human frame in various diseases than in studying the beauties of language  n b captain bayard whose case has been related may be seen at the new york coffeehouse in sweetingsalley
